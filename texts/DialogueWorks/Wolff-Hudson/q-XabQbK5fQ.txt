[Music] foreign [Music] s not bring the Russian economy to its knees in your opinion um well there are several there are several reasons probably the most important one is that the United States which designed the the sanction program as I think you know or I hope you know uh the United States has been busy sanctioning countries for quite a few years now uh if you want to go back half a century they've been sanctioning Cuba then they sanction Iran then they sanction North Korea and one could go on they've done a lot and Russia repeatedly um so the whole idea of a sanctioned program as well as the design uh and maintenance of a sanction program is an American specialty and was in the case of Russia was anticipated that it would be used um and I should mention China too because it's an important part of this reason anyway what the United States did was design a sanction program and then Prevail on mostly its European allies to complement or implement or support whatever you like the sanction program uh and indeed the single most important sanction against Russia not the only one but the most important one was Europe's decision to support the United States in refusing to continue to purchase Russian oil and Russian gas because those had become very important basic sources of energy for Western Europe and the expectation was that if the United States organized the biggest most comprehensive sanctions program it could building on all the previous experiments in sanctions then they would get two results the collapse of Russia and therefore the inability of Russia to remain in Ukraine let alone to continue to to fight in Ukraine but there were a number of voices in the United States who were so convinced of the effect of the sanctions program that they spoke about weakening Russia in a general way and in some cases they imagined Russia would disintegrate and break up into different parts that would be open to Western investment and political maneuver of the same kind that happened after 1989 in Eastern European countries from Latvia Lithuania and Estonia in the north all the way down uh to Bulgaria uh in the south and so this was the plan this was the hope this was the plan and the sanctions would include most importantly cutting off exports of oil and gas for Russia and then the extraordinary step which in the long run will have the most important consequences seizing Russian Financial Assets in Western Europe and in the United States blocking Russia from using the international payments system um and if you if you understand what that means kind of paying for the war in Iraq by seizing the Russian assets and using them to reimburse Western Europe and the United States to rebuild Ukraine once the Russians had been forced out this this was broadly speaking the dream the hope the plan okay so why did it fail well for two or three reasons but I'm gonna concentrate on the most important ones the most important ones had to do with the fact that European and American strategy did not understand the relationships that had been built up between Russia and other countries around the world above all China but also India and beyond that the bricks and beyond that the Shanghai cooperation organization and beyond that much of what we call now the global South these uh areas had developed economic relationships of great importance not so much with Russia but with China and because of the determination of Russia and China to work together in response to the American sanctions all of this support was mobilized and the mobilization took again many forms but I'm going to concentrate on two of them number one that these countries led by China and India would purchase Russian oil and gas in huge quantities Not only would they purchase the oil and gas for their own use but they would work together with many countries which would buy Russian oil and gas and then resell it to the Europeans because it was now called Nigerian oil and gas or Malaysian oil and gas or you know Peruvian oil and gas since these weren't sanctioned and it is very difficult to identify where oil and gas come from once they get moved around they were able to continue to provide Europe with Russian oil and gas but they called it something else and it was much more expensive because they had to be paid to play this game and so the right they bought Russian oil and gas but they raised the price in order for the Europeans to get it but in many cases it was still cheaper than buying liquefied natural gas from the United States which is what Europe was increasingly being forced to do and the second way there that the West misunderstood is that they did not see the extent of the cooperation and the determination of many countries around the world to reduce their dependence on the U.S dollar and to shift their economic dependence to be shared they would still hold U.S dollars not the way they did before not as many as before but they would continue to hold U.S dollars and trade in U.S dollars but they would increasingly do it also in Chinese Yuan and in the currencies of a number of countries including Russia if they would be backed by either gold or the Chinese Yuan and basically what the brics countries did was make a commitment to guarantee trade in Yuan and to promise to move which they're going to do this coming week to support the Yuan with gold long story short Russia was able to utilize its relationships with China India the brics and other parts of the world as a substitute and an offset to the sanctions impact from the West that was why Russia didn't fall to its knees or nothing like that If he if we look at the number of countries that were invited to this brick Summit it's it seems like a revolution against the US dollar everybody wants to join brics how once you're taking this well you know it's something that should not surprise people except for two things if you don't pay attention to international finance then you're not aware of how the development over the last 20 years has led up to this point brics is not a new organization brics has been around for many years and they have had conferences and meetings and they have said what they are concerned about and they have said what they're interested in the real difference now is that the global South for the first time has a leader with real economic muscle real economic power and that's the new phenomena and that means that every small country in the world now has an opportunity it did not have for the most of the last century for most of the last century certainly after World War II so 1945 there's been only one economic superpower that has to be understood the Soviet Union never was an economic competitor to the United States and let me give you a simple statistic right now 2023 the GDP gross domestic product which is a number economists use to give you an idea of how big an economy is strictly speaking it measures the output of goods and services in one calendar year 12 months and we keep records for every country how big is your GDP gross domestic product okay for the most recent year 21 2022 the gross domestic product of the United States roughly 21 22 trillion dollars the gross domestic product of Russia over the last year or two one and a half trillion dollars in other words there is no similarity here there is no equality of economic resources one country is enormously rich and the other one isn't you know uh Britain and Italy they have maybe three four five trillion dollar economies bigger than Russia but nowhere near the United States there's only one country that comes near to the United States and that's the People's Republic of China whose GDP last year depending on how you count about 17 maybe 18 trillion dollars that's a competitor still significantly smaller than the United States but huge and when you remember that they are now the manufacturing center of the world and you remember that they have a population four times larger than that of the United States then you begin to understand that for the first time the United States has a real serious economic competitor and here's the reason that's so important every country in Latin America every country in Africa every country in Asia that needs to borrow money that needs to get capital investment to build up their roads to build up their internet infrastructure to develop their their resources of water power or solar power they now have two places to go they don't just go to the United States and Western Europe that's what it was from 1945 to the present they now have an alternative they can go to China they can go to China plus India plus Britain plus Brazil plus Russia Etc and they can play them against each other they can go to China and say will you build the railroad then they can go to France and Britain will you build the railroad and they can make a deal they can take the better offer and the better offer often comes from China because they're big enough and Rich enough to do it and therefore there's a let me put it dramatically to you we have a different world economy now and every player in that economy every country on this planet is re-fixing redesigning reorganizing its economic and political and foreign policies to take account of the arrival of the Chinese achievement and the fact that countries like India and Russia and Brazil are working closely with the Chinese they want to have an opportunity to pick and choose and play the West against the East they don't want that to go away they want there to be a competitor to the US dollar because they're going to get a much better deal from the United States or from the EU or from Japan if there's a competitor called the brics China and its allies that they can bargain with and I can assure you because I live in the United States and I was born in the United States I've lived on worked all my life here that huge majority of the American people do not know what I've just been talking about there is very little discussion in this country of the changed World economy if China comes up it is looked upon the way the Soviet Union used to be it's like a continuation of the Cold War as if 1989 had never happened there is what psychologists call a massive denial of the new world they don't want to face it and and I understand I'm an American so I have some sympathy for this Americans are being asked to watch the decline of the American Empire and they don't want it and they don't want to see it and they don't want to worry about it so they are doing everything they can either to pretend it isn't happening or to see the whole thing as a replay of the struggle between the United States and the Soviet Union across most of the 20th century it's neither of those things it's it's not something you can deny and it's not the equivalent of the struggle with the Soviet Union because again and that's why I use the number the United States is only a little richer than China whereas the United States was always enormously richer than the Soviet Union or Russia ever were and that reality is new and it is producing in the United States one mistake after another let me give you an example of the of the Mis of a mistake under President Trump after 2016 because of his complicated political uh dimensions he wanted to be friendly with Russia as you know with Putin and so forth and because American politics requires an evil enemy he made China the evil enemy and he declared a trade war against China and he declared a tariff war against China which went on from 19 from 2016 excuse me 2017 right through uh the four years of his term it was supposed to get China to change its government it was supposed to get China to change its economic organization it was supposed to change China's export and import it failed on everything it accomplished absolutely nothing trade between China and the United States grew every year investment by Americans in China grew every year China didn't change its government China didn't change its economic organization it changed nothing but it showed the world something extraordinary that when the United States goes against another country with such power trade War tariff War putting the American Navy in the South China Sea starting to talk again about Taiwan that it makes no difference that it doesn't work that the United States can say all kinds of things do all kinds of things threaten all kinds of things and it doesn't matter many decades ago the revolutionary leader in China Mao Zedong enjoyed saying that the United States was a tiger but a tiger made out of paper a paper tiger in other words it wasn't really a tiger it was only the picture of a tiger but people didn't believe him they thought the United States was a real tiger when when everything Trump did failed and by the way Biden is continuing what Trump did and continuing to fail the rest of the world is given a very profound lesson the United States as a superpower keeps failing it cannot achieve it cannot regain its super power status it either gives that up or it's going to have to fight a nuclear war with Russia and China and that's an unspeakably stupid thing to do and then at least for the time being the leadership in the United States seems to understand that so they're stuck they can't fight a nuclear war but they can't stop watching the disintegration of the American Empire it's a very difficult situation which is why you see very bizarre behavior a one day after the Secretary of State Mr blinken or the Secretary of the Treasury Ms Yellen goes to Beijing sits down with Xi Jinping or other high officers of the Chinese government talks about we have to learn to live together we have to work things out one day later the president who sent them there refers to to Xi Jinping as an evil dictator this is chaos it makes no sense what are the Chinese supposed to do are we actually going to work something out or are you declaring war what this chaos is also demonstrating to the world that the United States is stuck doesn't know where to go doesn't know how to proceed last point the collapse of the dollar that's because the dollar is a as a world currency was a way for the for many countries to be unable to develop themselves the United States could at any time destroy their currency it could for example have a period of time when loans are zero percent interest like the first 20 years of this Century interest rates were brought down you lend money here that money then goes to like I'll pick a country Malaysia and you have cheap low interest loans to Malaysia but they're made in dollars the Federal Reserve decides to control an inflation in the United States by raising interest rates so what are the Malaysians going to do when their loans come due normally they'd roll over the law if they owe the U.S 2 billion they will borrow a new 2 billion to pay off the old 2 billion the problem is the old 2 billion had a half a percent and the new 2 billion have five percent they can't afford they can't do that they they can't do it and then they're completely destroyed their plans their commitments their foreign reserves they can't function because they depend on the U.S dollar they have to be behaving they have to get dollars because for example Saudi Arabia will not sell them oil unless they can pay and they have to they're trapped suddenly they have an option China will sit down with them and let them pay for oil with something else you know what they might pay uh allow them to pay with oil they might allow them to pay with rubles which means the Russians can use rubles to buy rubber from Malaysia which they never could do before because the Malaysians can take the rubles and buy oil from China you know that nobody needs the dollar anymore no one is in dependent on the dollar no one's currency is backed by a dollar Reserve which can disappear if the Federal Reserve raises interest rates if you put all that together what you're seeing is the loss of the United States of its economic dominance it's in the dollar it's in the failure to control China it's in the fact that China and its allies the brics the the Shanghai cooperation these are alternative developmental money houses that every smaller country can begin to access that's why you're seeing so many small countries they want to join the Shanghai cooperation organization or they want to join the bricks they don't want to be left out of being in a position to choose to let the west and the East bid for their support the Russians tried to do that but they never had enough money to make that work the Chinese do and that's a radical difference that many people in the world do not yet understand one of the greatest events that has happened in 2022 in September 2022 was the sabotage of the northern pipeline we know that the Europe's economy is in trouble from the car production in Europe was increasing up until 2022 and from 2022 to 2023 it was a drastic reduction of 36 percent how do you see the Europe's economy considering the sabotage and all the difficulties they're facing right now here here's my answer to your question there are two europes now Europe is effectively split not in the way you might think it's not Eastern Europe or Western Europe uh it's not the Europe in the EU the Europe not in the EU yet the important difference is in every country it's a difference between those political and economic interests who want to keep the alliance with the United States they are used to that it has been the political reality now for just about 75 years many of these leaders have built their careers on that that they are anti-communist anti-socialists they're the conservative party um in Germany they have a conservative party in England they're the conservative parties in Italy uh in France everywhere and they are committed to the alliance with the United States but here's the problem the alliance with the United States now requires mobilizing in support of Ukraine against Russia supporting and joining in the sanctions against Russia and also joining more moderately in the U.S war with China which is all of these three things are going on at the same time and there is a growing part of Europe inside every country that doesn't want to pay the enormous economic and political costs of staying with the United States so Europe for example has an inflation now twice that of the United States because the sanctions have driven up the price of oil and gas and energy driven up the price of food for all the reasons that people more or less understand um and the result is that the Europeans are being competed or if you like priced out of the market China and its allies on the one hand the United States and its allies on the other they didn't have an explosion in the price of energy they didn't have an explosion in the price of food again let me give you just some statistics which so many people don't know even though they are very public right Europe has been struggling with inflation rates above 10 in most of the different countries the United States had that but has brought it down now but what is the inflation rate in China zero nothing last year it was half of one percent or three quart in other words when you hear President Biden talk about inflation well yes we have it but it is everywhere in the world that's not true he's just lying why would the president why would he bother to lie about something which in 10 seconds going on Google you can find out what the numbers are it's it's it's very strange Behavior well the answer is they have got a crisis on their hands there are businessmen I'll give you some examples um one of the former heads of the HSBC Bank that's the largest bank in Europe has been telling everybody that he can speak to Cowper he has a hyphenated last name towels calper or something close to that but I'm interested in him because he is saying to everybody Europe is making a terrible mistake it's betting on the wrong horse in the race his implication you should bet on China not on the United States the United States is an Empire going down and China is an Empire coming up and Europe is making a terrible terrible mistake I'll give you another example um one of the highest Executives in the South Korean corporation Samsung it's now a global Corporation or makes telephones and everything else uh I believe a woman but I'm not sure but she reads it she's now a member of the South Korean Parliament she basically made a statement two weeks ago saying if the United States continues it's America First sanctioned program they will organize Asia to turn against America now my background is European so I follow I speak French and I speak German so I follow events in Europe even though I'm an American and I can assure you that right below the con the surface of the conservative parties that dominate Europe most of Europe not in Portugal not in Spain but in most of the other countries the conservatives dominate right below them are the business community and the business Community is not happy with being destroyed because they can't compete in the world since the energy price is too high in Europe and the food is too high and the workers are getting angry about what's happening to their standard of living and the governments are having to help workers pay for energy help workers pay for food which means they can't do the other things they're expected to do for the employer class you're building a political explosion in Europe and it's and Europe is being torn apart just below this surface I for example would not be surprised if over the next two or three years you saw a sudden swing of European politics sharply to the left saying to the Socialists the Communists and whoever else the anti-capitalist parties okay now you try to do something because the right wing which is in power has failed the right wing is is presiding over a Europe that is being destroyed by the tension between the United States and China it is for example obvious if you follow the politics in Great Britain that the conservative party there is dying it's falling apart it cannot hold together uh the last three or four Prime Ministers uh have been a joke this one is a joke the woman before was a joke Boris Johnson was a bad joke and the labor party is simply waiting to come in and take over not that the labor party is all that different but it's the population that looks at the at the conservatives and says you've been in power for a long time and the situation of Europe keeps getting worse if we consider the situation of Ukraine right now we know that they lost the big part of their economy to to Russia and if they lose adasa nikolaaf they're gonna they're gonna lose their access to to the Black Sea right and how do you see the future of Ukraine well I think to be honest with you um I come from a family that was very badly hurt in World War II many of our my relatives died in that war so for me I look at the the the photographs coming from Ukraine and I'm horrified no no population should be forced to go through that my parents became refugees millions of ukrainians have become refugees and have gone you know to Poland or or or any of many many countries that they have run to um and and I know enough to know like with my parents that refugees often don't come back and the Ukraine has lost territory the Ukraine has lost many cities the Ukraine has lost millions of its people I mean this is a tragedy on a scale you know and for me therefore the only question really is how can we stop this because what's going on is a war between the United States and China that's the real issue that is being fought as a war between the United States and Europe and Russia you know and everybody's fighting to the last Ukrainian they did this this should not be allowed you know it's crazy that people who aren't ukrainians are in a position to destroy Ukraine I mean it's horrible so my first interest how do we get this to stop but I understand that there are differences of opinion I think for Ukraine at this point they have a terribly difficult situation because if they don't help bring this to an end I don't think there will be a Ukraine between what the Russians will do and look I'm not I'm no military expert I don't pretend to be but as a as a layperson who who knows about Europe who studies Europe I speak European languages I always have um Ukraine is not winning this war Russia is which shouldn't come as a surprise because Russia is a very big powerful Rich relative to Ukraine which isn't those things so this this should surprise no one and I think what what really Ukraine has to decide if you want to survive you have to be able to be the agent of Peace here you have in a way a good political moral argument you're dying your people are suffering your country is being destroyed you want it to stop that's a very difficult argument either for Russia or for the United States or for China what are they going to do said no but what you have is a leader Mr zielinski and I I assume he speaks for a significant part of Ukrainian public opinion he wants to keep fighting he actually thinks that he with the support of the West can regain all the territory uh in the eastern part of Ukraine including the Crimean Peninsula that Russia took earlier uh the Russians have said in every way that I can understand they will not they won't do that and Russia has nuclear weapons I wish they didn't but they do and that you can't pretend that that's not there they have said that this is an existential Threat all right so for me some deal has to be made here I hope that the deal allows Ukraine to enjoy end of the war and to have at least a large part of what its territory was my suspicion is they're going to have to give Russia something but it's not clear what that something is the West wants us to think well they'd have to give up their land well the Russians might accept to take a certain part of the Ukraine make it Russia they've already done that with the four little sections of eastern Ukraine that they have declared are now Russia maybe they'll take that but you know you might give them something else don't give them eastern Ukraine keep that Ukraine but give the Russians something else they want for example renew reopen the market in Western Europe let the Europeans get cheap oil and gas from Russia like they have been doing for decades that would be very good for the European economy they would now be able to compete because the energy cost to produce everything would come down dramatically Russia would be very happy to have again the cheap the ability to sell massive quantities of energy indefinitely to Europe maybe a deal could be worked there that the Europeans get something they need and want cheap food cheap energy the Russians get something they want a market for their energy a market for their food Ukraine gets What It Wants territory back it regains as much as possible of the territory lost to the Russian military over the last year and a half but in order for this to happen Mr zielinski has to be able to get up and say that's what I want but of course that will make the United States and Western Europe angry they have spent 70 80 maybe a hundred billion dollars on that war they want Ukraine to win and Russia to lose but the problem is if you do that the Russians are showing you they are going to take Ukraine on the ground and they're doing that maybe not as fast as they wanted to maybe at a higher cost than they thought they would have to pay but they're doing it and they're demonstrating that they know how to do it that they have the technology to do it they have the resources they have the will they're not falling apart economically you know those are the realities as long as Mr zielinski only talks about getting the land back and dares not become a voice saying I recognize that if the Russians give us back the land they took they have to get something in order to give that up and I want the West don't give me any more arms don't give me more missiles reopen the the market for Russian oil and gas buy Russian grain by Ukrainian grain too that will be a that will give the Russians something they want get rid of his sanctions this will be very beneficial to Russia China will urge Russia to take this deal and you will save Ukraine from more horrible destruction but Mr zielinski isn't doing that if he did it would change everything I think if he stood up and said my people have suffered enough we made an effort we need to have peace and we we have paid the price in Ukraine with lost cities with lost people with Refugee we have paid the price Europeans now have to give us what we need for peace which is not tanks and it is not you know guns it is something that will give the Russians enough that they give us back the part of Ukraine that they took or as much of it as we that's a negotiation that gives us peace I think well let me put it this way it may not work I can't be sure of course but if you try it you're not killing people try it try it see if it works even if we say a ceasefire for three months while we try to work out this deal in Paris or or in Warsaw or wherever it would be done I think the whole world would applaud the end the Ukrainian people could breathe for three months be very hard to restart a war once you did this right because at the end of three months everybody would say take another month you know it and I think that's why we don't see this because those who want to fight to the last Ukrainian look let me be very honest with you I I don't I don't know what where are you right now where do you Brazil okay uh let me tell you something about the United States the vast majority of my neighbors the people I live with I live in New York City so that's where I am they don't know where Ukraine is they have no concept they don't know half of the United States is not aware that Russia and the Soviet Union are not the same thing we had a senator Tom tuberville of from the state of Alabama who became famous as he was running for the Senate and he was elected he's now the senator when he was running he said over and over again in front of television how proud he was of his father who had been a soldier in the American Army during World War II fighting Soviet communism and the newspapers had to point out to him that during World War II the enemy of the United States was not the Soviet Union that the United States's Ally was the Soviet Union and the enemy was Adolf Hitler and uh Mussolini in Italy okay yeah that's the level of understanding in this country no one cares about any of this this is a this is an unimportant battle far away the government tries to get people all excited by painting Putin as if he were another Stalin or something like that and you know a few people get excited about it but the vast majority of the people don't know and don't care about any of this they're worried about their job they're worried about whether they can afford to send their kid to school to college whether they can afford to pay the bills for the groceries their family they're they're concerned about the issues immediately around them maybe in their larger Community maybe in the United States but in a small corner of Europe not at all so the anyone who tells you that the United States couldn't change its policy that's completely untrue the this is not a country invested in this struggle absolutely not this is a maneuver of a conservative Democratic Party that needs a foreign enemy and it has decided that the best way to fight China is to weaken its Ally Russia and it is very happy to have the Ukrainian people pay the price you see that this fight in Ukraine is a part of the game of containing China yes absolutely you will not understand it if you if you think otherwise for the the United States now understands that the last 30 years a period of time called globalization and whatever else you want was very profitable for the United States it opened up China Nixon and Kissinger back in the 1970s and American companies are producing everything in China very low wages very profitable but what they didn't understand was that the Chinese used the same 30 years to industrialize their country and in the end they did a better job of industrializing their country than the United States did in bringing profit to its capitalists the United States succeeded it brought massive profits to the United States it's been a profitable time in the United States but the Chinese outmaneuvered them economic growth for the last 30 years in the United States averaged one and a half to two percent GDP growth per year over the same 30-year period in China six to nine percent China grew two to three times year in and year out and suddenly the United States discovers that the Chinese have become the first real competitor it has seen and the first reaction that you could see under Trump and the second reaction that you can see now under Biden or the attempt to stop the Chinese to turn it around to close it down to build military bases all around to try to what we call here contain China because that was what was done with Russia but here again the mistake Russia was small weak and poor China isn't anymore and that makes this strategy not work and this is maddening for the United States and so having the seventh fleet around Taiwan fighting against Russia in Ukraine sanctioning everybody you know this is the hysterical first stage my hope is and it's possible that cooler heads will prevail and a different approach to China will come afterwards thank you
