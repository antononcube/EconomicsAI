let's get started Richard with your article about the situation in the Middle East and the way that you're describing the Israel's dead end in that article what is your understanding and what are you trying to say in that article okay yeah the purpose of that article was to draw a connection that I think will help people understand uh the Israel Gaza Horrors that we are living through um and I don't just mean Gaza the West Bank the whole story there of of that conflict and what I link it to in this article is an experience of another settler colonialism an attempt by a minority to take over a majority of people that are ethnically or religiously or otherwise distinct from them to and to see whether I can draw some lessons and to do that I made use of uh a book I published many years ago uh which grew out of my doctoral dissertation that had to do with the colonialism practiced in the east African country of Kenya by the British and my book covers the establishment of the British colony in that part of the world Britain had several colonies in Africa as I think most people know and several in the eastern part of Africa which is where Kenya is located long story short what the British did there was to arrive and to make a determination all by themselves that they were going to establish a colony based on settling British citizens in the highlands in the middle the geographic middle of Kenya the highlands have a very fertile soil they have a very good climate it was a logical place um for them to do this and they made the effort to deter uh what would be good to grow there and to what would be good to produce and again long story short they determined that would be coffee which to this day is an important export of Kenya around the world and they produce particularly arabica coffee which is the highest quality among coffees and theirs is even better than most in order to do this they expelled they pushed away the Africans that had lived for centuries on this land they put them in they forced them out I mean Force physical military force and forced them into reservations portions of land much inferior to the land they were forced out of and very quickly it was clear what thew iic here was the Reser reserved areas and and the major group that suffered this was a tribal grouping for those that might be interested known as the kikuyu tribe in that part of Africa they could not survive on these reserved areas there wasn't enough land it wasn't a good enough quality they weren't used to this kind of farming this was an impossible way for them to survive but of course the British had the solution which is okay you live on the reservation and then every day you go to the coffee plantation and you work and the coffee Planters the British settlers paid your wages which enabled you to get by the government then came in the British government and taxed the wages so it took back part of the money that the settlers you have to laugh because the alternative would you you'd have to cry because what it meant was that the these abused expelled Africans had to work for next to nothing to grow the coffee and then got taxed on their next to nothing so that the colonial government wouldn't have to tax the settlers let alone the British people back home so it was a desperate Desire by the way all of this is explicit I spent time in the British colonial office in London I spent time in the British museum in London looking at all the records and they and they all discussed it and they debated the British knew exactly what they were doing anyone who wants to excuse this nonsense by thinking that the British and they love this phrase in England muddled through is nuts they didn't muddle at all they worked all this out and uh that's why Kenya functioned as a commodity excuse me as a colony but eventually and here's my point this was an untenable Arrangement because it was an immense exploitation of about three to four million Africans by a handful a few thousand European settlers and It produced tension and conflict and bitterness the the formal colony was established in 1895 and and almost on schedule 50 years later around 19 in the early 50s it blew up and suddenly the African population was no longer having individual efforts to change the situation or even small group efforts it had a fullscale organized rebellion and it was known as the ma Mau Rebellion was led by a very charismatic African leader named Jomo Kenyata uh and the British moved in to violently suppress the Mau Rebellion it was characterized in the most luid terms you could imagine in the European press which had it all set up as the rise of the Savages who had to be put down by the benevolent British with their commitment to Peace So this war to make peace ended up with a with the victory of the British they defeated the Mau they captured and imprisoned Joo Kenyatta it was one of those great ironies it proved to the British that their situation was hopeless because whatever they did what this Mau Rebellion had showed them was that the illusion that they could survive in a settler colonialism was an illusion because in the Mau put down it's true only 33 uh uh settlers I don't remember the exact number a trivial number of settlers were killed a very small number of European military were killed and about 12 or 15,000 uh Africans were killed so you have numbers that should remind you of Israel and the the Palestinians but the British had to face they really had no choice that what the Mau had showed them is they would have to spend a Fortune of money preparing for the next ma Mau which could happen at any time the ma the first Mau they defeated but they had learned how to fight to to repress the Mau took the British seven years an enormous expenditure of money and this was remember at a time when the rest of the British Empire and particularly the the center of it namely India had been lost to them and they basically made the decision they can't do this anymore because the prospect was for Endless conflict costing endless amounts of money disrupting whatever that Colony might hope to it was a decision that you might say let's cut our losses from what this is and so even though they won the war they ended up saying okay we're leaving they released Mr Kenyata from jail and he became the first president of an independent Kenya and they've LED their own life as a nation since that time to this moment that I'm speaking and I hope I've given you a flavor the transition to Israel should be fairly obvious right it's a settler colonialism you plunk a group of mostly Europeans in the middle of a non-european community that's quite a bit larger there's a bit of a difference that the Israeli percentage has grown and the Palestinian has shrunk but it's still the case the rest of it fits pretty well and again I would argue that what happened in October of 2023 was the rough equivalent of the Mau Uprising and you've now spent a fortune of money dealt a blow to the Israeli economy from which it will take years to recover uh yes you have the Absurd imbalance between how many Israelis died and how many Palestinians die but that is really like the African and it doesn't change that what Israel is looking at now having seen what Hamas could do having now seen that h M could actually survive this Onslaught that they Unleashed on them well like the British they are looking at an open-ended when will this ever stop and they have enough problems as a society adding this and so I'm hoping that writing it up this way and drawing the parallels and making the equivalences might shed light on how to look at the Israeli phenomena and to see the dead end toward which it is moving and maybe come to some rational solution beforehand rather than and and this is directed as much at the Israelis in hopes they see it as it is to the Palestinians because it does Shore up the Palestinian notion that in the end they will win Donald Trump's solution for the conflict in the Middle East and he the way he was talking about the Middle East and the United States taking over Gaza and maybe solving the situation for Israelis there are two type of arguments right now one says that Donald Trump wants to avoid n's attack on Gaza to go after some sort of attack and the other argument says that Donald Trump is doing everything that net wants even more than that what's your understanding on what has happened well um first of all it's pretty clear that um uh Mr Trump when he was uh speaking to this subject was reading off cards that had been written for him talking points um the widespread suspicion is that those were written by Jared Kushner is son-in-law who's always had his eye on real estate development in Gaza uh and who basically uh uh constructed the Abraham Accords so-called Abraham Accords um between UAE Bahrain U and Israel uh with Morocco and Sudan also somewhat less involved um precisely in order to um Sid sideline the the Palestinian issue uh take it off the table um and U and proceed to make Israel acceptable in its region without dealing with the Palestinian issue um in the way that the only way that can address that issue which is self-determination so uh it's been this has been a very consistent stand and I would remind you that when Mr Trump was in office the first uh time uh he he recognized Jerusalem as the capital of Israel contrary to many International uh law legal uh decisions uh which left it to be uh an international City first and then ADV visis envisaged it as the as a divided city with the capital of the Palestinian state in East Jerusalem he recognized the annexation of the Golan Heights he moved the US Embassy to Jerusalem uh we have heard that in the campaign his campaign for office this time Miriam adelen the Widow of the late casino owner who once said that he was ashamed that he had worn an American army uniform rather than an Israeli army uniform very clear that he had no divided loyalty he was loyal to Israel rather than the United States uh she gave him apparently $100 million in return for a pledge to permit the annexation of the West Bank by Israel and the ethnic cleansing everywhere so I agree with you there are these two ways of speaking or speculating about what Mr Trump is up to but I don't have any doubt at all that he's just in the uh he's just trying to help Mr Netanyahu complete the ethnic cleansing of Palestine the desist movement has always wanted to carry out uh and in the case of Raza well he made two comments one was with regard to vaza that once it was emptied it would be redeveloped and turned over to the United States which I um I find rather Preposterous but anyway um that's what he said um and the Palestinians would be resettled somewhere in nice the latest word is that since both Egypt and Jordan as well as Indonesia have turned down uh any resettlement of Palestinians um his people have been looking at Somali land punt land in Somalia to unrecognized uh self- declared independent regimes uh as a place to resettle the Palestinians or alternatively in Morocco presumably in return for a huge payment of of some sort but um uh anyway that's what we know about that uh but the clear uh statement is about Gaza by him is entirely consistent with what Mr Netanyahu has claimed namely that he had assurances for Mr Trump as Mr Trump came into the presidency that he Netanyahu could restart the war of annihilation on the Palestinians at any moment of his choosing the other thing Mr Trump said which was somewhat obscured because of the furor about Gaza uh was that he would consider uh the Israeli annexation of the West Bank which quote some people think is a good idea unquote he said um and make a decision in four weeks well this goes back to the alleged payment of payoff by Mrs adelon um for just that uh so I don't think there's any doubt whatsoever that all of this is uh premised on the return of the Israeli Armed Forces to the war of annihilation and the extension of that not just to Kaza but to the West Bank Donald Trump and his position and his solution for the conflict in the Middle East many people are confused about what he was talking about what's your understanding of that I'm right up there with them I mean uh my understanding is that he didn't pre-clear this with anybody um and I think there was a reason for that uh you know he has surrounded himself with some of the most pro-israel Pro Zionist um Americans uh possibly and if he had done the normal staff coordination processes um they would have leaked this to Benjamin Netanyahu in advance the Israelis would have been given Advanced copies uh people would have met the side and to pre-brief the U the Israelis um apparently Trump didn't tell anybody that this was happening including Netanyahu and um and took him by surprise um and you have to ask yourself why why would that be the case and I think the answer is that he was um putting Netanyahu in his place and taking Israel off the playing board um Israel doesn't according to Trump's plan Israel not a player um the Israeli Army won't be involved Israeli security won't be involved Israel's not going to be land um I mean everything that Israel thought was going to happen with Gaza isn't happening under Trump's plan um so you have to ask yourself why why that would be um why would this president who has said he's a great friend of Israel who has surrounded himself with zionists and uh and such make a decision to humiliate Benjamin Netanyahu in front of the world stage and take Israel off the uh the playing board and I think it's it relates to a statement that he made um you know after his first term where someone talked about Middle East peace process and he said look there's two players here but one of them doesn't want peace and that is Israel so he knows that Israel is the problem he knows that Benjamin Netanyahu is the problem also that's why he reposted um Jeffrey Sax's U condemnation of Benjamin Netanyahu why would why would Trump do that if he was you know the the compliant puppet of net because he's not he doesn't like Netanyahu he recognizes n is the problem not the solution um and so he he did this um Ian that's the only way to read this there's no other way to read this uh than that um and then we can look at what he put on the table it's so absurd outrageous and unrealistic that it's just not going to happen why would he do that why would Donald Trump make that his opening Gambit because that's how Donald Trump always operates um you know I'm not saying it's always successful um I think he's gonna find out that it isn't going to work in uh with the Russians but um on this state let me ask you I mean it's a rhetorical question but um if Donald Trump had gone back to business as usual that is leaning heavy towards Israel for a solution that means there would never be a solution just more death and destruction endless fighting uh for the Palestinians no hope whatsoever for the Arab world continued humiliation um and so he had to do something different what he put on the table was completely different it's unlike any proposal that's ever been put out there before and I but it's not a solution it's a proposal uh meaning that he has swept the board clear now he's put his uh you know his his his proposition on the table and I think to get a seat at the table you have to say more than no I think to get a seat at the table you have to say no but here's an alternative here's here's um you know a counter offer and I think that's what's going on here I think Trump is playing you know a a a game that's so unlike normal statesmanship so unlike you know normal diplomacy that people are just totally you know been out of whack over this um I don't take what he said literally I don't read into anything he said because none of that's going to happen literally none of it can happen um I I view this as a opening um you know proposition in order to get people to come in and say okay how do we solve this you see because you can't rely on the the past tools the past tools didn't work anybody wants to sit here and make a case that uh Trump should have just continued doing what everybody's been doing for 40 or 50 years then you oh you're you're saying you really don't care about the Palestinian people I know people are going to say well Trump doesn't he didn't you know he's taking he's not taking anything people stop he's not taking anything the United States doesn't own Gaza uh we're not putting troops on the ground we're not driving 1.9 million people out it isn't going to happen none of that's going to happen that's just Trump's opening G and again you you have to you know rely on you know people who assess what others do for a living look for patterns of Life patterns of behavior and Trump's past patterns of behavior I think are a good judge of what he's up to go back and look at North Korea and what he did with North Korea in his first term fire and fury threatening nuclear war Kim jung-un if you sneeze if you dare do this I'm going to blow you off the face of your Boop six months later he's meeting with the guy three meeting including one at the demilitarized zone crossing over into North Korea to shake the guy's hand I don't think anybody who heard Donald Trump speak at the United Nations said that's how this ends and I can almost guarantee you that How This Ends isn't going to be anything like the statement made by Donald Trump in the white house it's just an opening Gambit it's the way Trump does business
