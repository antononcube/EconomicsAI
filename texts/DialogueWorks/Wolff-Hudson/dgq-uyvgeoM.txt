Elon Musk visited Israel and he talked with n they had a conversation on Twitter on X he compared Hamas to Nazis in your opinion is that realistic at the end of the day this type of thinking would benefit Israel and Israelis no I do not think it will benefit Israel and the Israelis uh I do not think that the most of the things that I have learned about coming out of Elon Musk uh are not really worth uh very much time they have proven to me something that my father once said to me it in order to be rich it is not necessary to be smart and I think Elon Musk is walking proof that my father had a good point when he made that uh remark uh I once admired a British film it was called being there and it featured uh the actor um whose name right now Peter forget his name right now uh very famous British comedian who was the lead actor and in the film uh being there a person with mental limitations who is function in as a gardener for a wealthy man discovers one day that the wealthy man has died and he doesn't know quite what to do he's the gardener and he listens to people who talk to him he doesn't quite understand what they are talking about but he's a nice person and he gets along with them long story short the movement the movie shows how he ends up being uh the president becomes the president of the United States um Peter sers is the actor's name and the movie is brilliant because as the title suggests where you end up in life depends above all on where you are whether you are in the right place at the right time to get to a lofty position or whether you may be not in the right place and so you don't get the position but as my colleague Stephen Resnik used to say the position makes the person much more than the other way around so I think Mr Netanyahu is a old politician on the way out and Mr musk is an old business this person likewise on the way out each of them has their achievements in their past not in their future and they are going out in ways that are how shall I be polite not very complimentary Mr musk took over Twitter and has if not already destroyed it seems on the way to doing it Mr Netanyahu uh uh inherits a government that was in great difficulty before and that government having moved several steps to the right wing which is also where the Nazi experience is located he's not doing real well either uh if you are familiar at all with internal Israeli politics you'll know that Mr Netanyahu scores a very badly on the polling inside Israel the majority of the people of Israel would like to see him gone as their leader uh and you put all that together the conversation between Mr musk and Mr Netanyahu I don't think is very significant one way or the other political root and article they're assuming that Trump would win the election in 2024 they're talking about your Europeans have to offer a Ukraine deal that Trump can refuse how do you see the Europe today are they helping themselves I think the Europeans are in very very difficult position I think that most of the leaders live in a world that is occupied also by leaders here in the United States we are saying in the United States more and more of us leftwing right-wing and in the middle that we have never seen a government in this case Mr Biden but potentially Mr Trump we have never before seen a government that seems so utterly out of touch with a majority of the people even the people who will vote for Mr Trump do so out of a mix of anger and bitterness and resentment and conspiracy theories many of which Mr Trump is a symbol for but is not connected to in any reasonable way he's not part of them and they're not part of him and the people who are going to be voting for Mr Biden are mostly people who are afraid of Mr Trump but are in no way do not feel that Mr Biden is a reliable member of whatever it is they think they are a part of and I see that in Europe everywhere I mean even if you don't believe in polling the feeling of the French people and I have family in France the feeling of the French people towards Emmanuel macron is to say the least uh he's a clown he's a person that do not take seriously they feel absolutely no loyalty to that I can perceive and it's not all that different in many of the other countries of Europe I mean Crystal clearly the the conservatives in England you know they're just waiting for the election they know they will lose to arrive the Germans are confused about a coalition that barely holds itself together that has nothing to do with the socialism of Olaf Schultz has even less to do with whatever the word green means in politics because the German green party is is disconnected from almost anything one can think of other than hostility to Russia and excitement about Ukraine and indeed when one looks at Europe one sees the minute you go below the surface people who are very disconnected from their uh European foreign policy what is this all about you know they are holding on to their Atlantic Alliance but that's because these are mostly older politicians who have been allied with the United States and Britain for so long they don't have any other place to go politically but but the young people and the people coming up and those who are not tied in to the old European alliance with the United States they are very unhappy about where things are going let me turn to the economics which which makes it even sharper the world is dividing into two major economic blocks the decline of the American Empire is happening together with the decline of the American block or if you like the G7 the United States Germany France Britain Italy Canada and Japan that's the G7 the alternative block is the bricks the original bricks Brazil Russia India China and South Africa and now the addition of the six new countries uh that were brought in okay if you look at the total GDP of the G7 it's about 29% of Global Production happens in the G7 in the bricks before adding the six new ones it was 33% that's a complete new world economically it is just a new world and notice please that the Europeans are not even in the story there is no European block what the Europeans have is a position for their four major economies Britain France Germany and Italy as a junior partner in the declining American Block that's a very poor position for Europe remember the last empire was the British Empire and it struggled to control the world and who did it struggle against mostly the French and German and Belgian Empires all of that is gone all of that has left Europe not knowing which way to go being out of the other Islands the biggest question if you're honest in the core of the European economy namely Germany but similar questions are being asked among a European industrialists is which way should we go is our future with the bricks or is our future with the G7 the mere fact that that is a question they have to ask themselves and they do because that is the great question for their immediate future tells you that they are in the position of deciding which way to go because NE in neither case will they be dominant they are not in that position they've lost that position they haven't been able to get Europe together they haven't been able to shape a European position watching the collapse of Europe into a chorus on Ukraine with the exception of you know Hungary and one or two others is watching the Europeans unable to make their own politics even the ukrainians would be better off if Europe had its own strategy had its own point of view that the ukrainians could then try to play the Americans off of the Europeans both of them against the Russians and the Chinese but the the ukrainians lack a Europe to deal with all they do is ask the Europeans to provide what the Americans no longer will do which the Europeans are doing again at least some of them although the political wind and not just in Italy we saw that a week ago in the Netherlands the Ukrainian are losing friends in Europe and Europe has many many reasons to cut its dependence on the United States and on the EUR the ukrainians these are real problems that no amount of political pretense is going to make go away you talk about bricks one of the new members of brixs is Argentina we know that recently as you predict in the other session you said that he's this rightwing candidate going to win would this guy be a solution for the difficulties that Argentina is experiencing right now and what are the roots of these difficulties that Argentina has right now there is a saying in the United States and I'm sure in other parts of the world and it goes like this even a broken clock is right right on time twice every day right look Argentina has been a seriously problematized economy for a long time it has made the decisions to use borrowed money particularly money borrowed from outside Argentina to try to solve its problems and it has found the result to be very very dangerous repeatedly okay it has also been very hostile to political Innovation from the left it has a long history of brutal repression of the left uh if you know the PO ICS and one of the things Mr Malay did was try to act out being friendly to Israel and the Jewish people because of the horrible history of what was done to Jewish uh residents of Argentina uh in past years and I'm not talking about the distant past I'm talking about the near past so Argentina entered this current economic situation this political situation with an inflation rate running over 100% that his price is doubling on an annual basis with loans it it cannot repay in foreign currencies etc etc it was a situation that proved proved to the Argentinian people what they have already understood but it proved it again the normal usual kind of Center left center right politics is unacceptable it has failed it has failed them repeatedly it doesn't offer Solutions and the political forces further to the left are still frightening for them and are repressed partly politically partly by the military okay what do you then do with a population that understands that Politics as Usual is a dead end is a failure that what you can say is that the problems of modern capitalism have outrun the capacity of the normal politics generalized or generated by that capitalis to solve and we see that everywhere that's why maon is ridicule in France that's why there's so much disaffection with the political leaders around the world look at them look at them look at the F person who was the opponent of Mr Malay in Argentina this is Casper milk toast there's nothing there to vote for who gets the attention is the person who says the most effectively I am not like all the others I am different from all the others I I will call them names I will insult them the best example I can think of is in my own country Mr Trump he is a crude person he doesn't pay his bills he abusively treats and speaks about women it's disgusting he's a disgusting human being as well as a a a newcomer to politics who clearly does not know anything about these issues but that makes him unique that makes him different he can get up and talk and the Very fact that he doesn't talk in the usual speak language he doesn't to he becomes attractive to people not because people agree with his policies first of all they don't know what those policies are number two he doesn't have clearly defined policies and number three the policies he does have are crazy they are there simply to Pro produce the feeling in people he's different so in the United States we have 7 5 years of Cold War and suddenly Mr Trump speaks nicely about Mr Putin what's that about that makes you very different oh you're different right it it's bizarre now what does Mr Malay do in Argentina he follows the Trump Playbook Mr Orban does that in Hungary the woman in Italy she does that that for the Italians but let's go back to Mr Malay in in Argentina he proposes to do away with the Central Bank of the country what sense does this make he proposes to get rid of the Argentinian currency and to replace it with the US dollar that raises more problems and difficulties and dangers for uh Argentina than anything else but it is very ATT attention grabbing the two most important countries trading with Argentina today are Brazil and China he has announced his intention to cut off the dependency of what are you talking about what what you can't do that or let's put it differently if you do it you will bring a catastrophe to your country and that catastrophe will wipe you out but you know something to win the election it was all a wonderful piece of theater and in order to make the point the man Mr Malay I don't know if you saw it but if you looked at photographs he had his hair wildly around his head he wore clown outfits he did everything that his advisors could think think of to show the people here is something different and that's what the people wanted here in the United States appropo your comment on political uh magazine article if Mr Trump wins next year which is possible and Mr Biden is the candidate whom he defeats which is possible it will be because Mr Mr Biden represents the same old center-left Democratic party just like Mr Bush represented the same old center right Mr Trump destroyed the Bush family politically and so now he's going to do the same thing to Mr Biden and the fact that Biden can show that Mr Trump has violated the law 100 times and is in trouble and is being tried in the court system of the United States won't make much difference because it doesn't change the fact that he's different look at that the guy's running from jail he may have to run for office from inside the prison and that too will make him unique and different you are watching the disintegration ation of the old political world if there's anything I can get across it would be that don't get caught in the details try to take a step back and ask the question what is going on here and the answer is the world is changing four centuries ago in the the 16th century we left the the feudal Europe behind and a new economic system came into being capitalism instead of Lords and surfs we had a new system with employers and employees that was not feudalism there was no wage in feudalism there was no labor market in feudal all of these things come with capital ISM there were markets for sure markets go back to Aristotle and Plato because you can read their de debates about markets by the way both of them were critical of markets which people today cannot imagine because it's the the great thinkers of ancient Greece but the capitalist World began had its Dynamic Center for first in England then in Western Europe then in the North America Japan and finally the whole world it has taken four centuries to become the dominant system but it's only in the last 50 years the last half century that the center the dynamic powerful Center of capitalism is disappearing the British Empire was the peak it has been downhill with the British decline temporarily postponed by the American replacement for the British but now the American is going down and it has become unmistakable where the dynamic growth Center of capitalism has gone it's not in England which is a joke as an economic unit that's why a a caricature clown like Boris Johnson could become the leader think about it a crude liar who loses his job because he gets caught lying like Trump again the same story it's over for Britain and everybody knows it even the British Now understand it brexit was a joke a terrible joke for the British who brought this on themselves the center of capitalism is gone from England it's gone from Europe it went for a while to the United States but it's now left the United States too and we all know where it went China India Brazil that's where it's gone that's where the growth is still remarkable so now we have capitalism global capitalism split the old in the west and the new in the East Old capitalism has new problems new capitalism will have its own problems which we know about because we saw them in the United States and Britain before two different capitalisms each struggling with their own problems as they compete with one another that's the new world and in that world the old po politics is redundant is irrelevant is powerless becomes literally clownish and that's what we're watching we're seeing the the extreme forms of that in mle in Argentina in Trump in Orban in um the anti-immigrant fellow in the Netherlands who won the other day and so on so we're watching where this bursts but don't be detailed by that particularity what's important is to see the larger picture of what is unfolding in front of us and here's perhaps the most important Point capitalism is splitting global capitalism that's already a fact we're all dealing with every little country in the world contemplating a a new Harbor they not need to build or investment in their school system or a Health Service now knows it has two power blocks to go to for a loan or a grant or a trade deal or a opportunity for their students to get higher education or whatever they can go west which is declining or they can go east which is growing rapidly and you can imagine where they're gonna go wow all of that is going on all all of that is the reality but behind it comes the old critique and that's the critique that says all of you are organizing your economy with a small group of people at the top who are the employers they can be private they can be government officials but they're the employers and they control a mass of people who are the employees they do that in the United States they do it in Poland they do it in Nigeria they do it in Beijing that's what they're doing and there's an alternative that has been there critiquing that system from the beginning and it's called socialism it's the idea that you can do better than having a system that produces goods and services with an employer and an employee you can have the alternative that the employees become their own employer they end the Gap it's no longer Master Slave it's no longer Lord and surf it's no longer employer employee it's finally the Democrat IC idea we govern ourselves not just in the community where we live but in the community where we work democracy in both of them interdependent one with the other that's not going away that critique is becoming sharper in the old capitalism and it is discovering new adherence in the new one too and that's GNA be the fight of the 21st century XI Jin ping believes that Marxism lism and Mao are two important elements that guided the Chinese people out of Darkness of a long night and established a new China can you describe us what are these two elements I of course I cannot tell you what's in the mind of Xi Jinping I have nothing to do with him or he with me and so I'm not sure exactly what he means I do know that Marxism leninism and so on are important systems of ideas in the world that they have affected everybody one way or another directly or indirectly um and so yes of course the Chinese uh have every reason especially since uh after 1949 they officially embraced uh Marxism leninism as a national uh idea before that it was the idea of the Chinese Communist party okay the problem here is that what Marxism and leninism mean have been differently interpreted in different parts of the world and that has happened to every other great idea in the history of the world it's never only understood in one way you know Christianity has Roman Catholics it has Greek Orthodox it has uh Protestants it had fill in the blank you all know that okay um the problem with XI jinping's argument I would argue is the following one of the major interpret interpretations of Marxism leninism has held that what is socialis ism is when the government takes a major position in deciding how to produce and distribute goods and services capitalism is then associated with a private operation of production and distribution utilizing a market whereas in socialism one interpretation went the government steps in you can have one kind of government socialism where the government manages and regulates the private sector that you had in the socialism we associate with Scandinavia or with Western Europe there you have socialists often with political power they control the state and they regulate a private capitalist economy and that's called you might call it socialism uh with the characteristics of Scandinavia or socialism with German characteristics or Italian or French or Spanish then you have a second different interpretation and this interpretation says no if you want to overcome capitalism it's not enough to regulate it it's not enough to control it you have to get rid of it you have to replace the private owners of means of production with the public the government representing the public as a whole should own and operate Enterprises roughly speaking this was done with industry in the Soviet Union now we get to the Chinese interpretation and remember that jiing ping supports the definition of China the self-identification of China as quote socialism with Chinese characteristics okay what that means is very concretely that XI jingping and his associates interpret Marx and Lenin in a way that is a hybrid midway between Scandinavian type socialism and Soviet type socialism it's a hybrid because in China today roughly half of the economy is government owned and operated Enterprises and the other half is privately owned and operated with a powerful regulatory Communist Party and Chinese State managing all of this now that is unique that is a definition of an operating socialism that is neither the Scandinavian Western European model nor the Soviet model it is a combination a hybrid and now to be fair to the Chinese they are able to say quite honestly that they have generated a better record of economic growth with their hybrid than either the Scandinavian or the Soviet model were able to achieve and that is true all the statistics we have not just from China but from the World Health Organization from the United Nations from the you name it confirm the broad out outlines of what I've just said so if Mr XI jingping means that the hybrid they've created has a debt to Marx and Lenin and all the Socialist experiments that have gone on before modern China that makes perfect sense I think that's true I think it's good that he shows we got some of what we've done from those experiments but like those experiments the future will be yet another form or forms of socialism that will draw on Chinese experience as well as Soviet and Scandinavian experience socialism is a work in progress socialism is the self-critique of capitalism it is the next stage and it will come one way or another sooner or later no doubt in forms we can't quite yet imagine but that will be the struggle of the 21st century and we will look back with irony and sarcasm at the naive people who at the end of the 20th Century thought that the struggle between capitalism and socialism had finally been resolved the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe collapsed the United States had what some have called the unipolar moment a period of time when it dominated the world alone but the the people who are marxists in the hegelian sense who understand that the one thing that never changes is the process of change itself they would have understood don't be naive socialism will surprise you and boy has it it's come roaring back all over the world one way or another old capitalism will be struggling with socialist criticism after all Bernie Sanders is a socialist and he proved that a socialist can become the most popular politici in the United States which current polling of people younger than 35 already shows us and we're going to see socialists emerging in Brazil they're already there in China they're already there in India they've always been there they have there issues to raise their proposals to make and the difficulties the contradictions inside capitalism old and new will generate their corresponding self-criticisms and those will be the socialism of the future that seems very clear to me and the fact that the people who run today's capitalism can't see or identify or understand socialism does not surprise me because what is clear to me is they cannot see or understand their own capitalist system either Richard just to wrap up this session I want to talk about Corell West and Jill Stein two important candidates in this 20204 election how do you find each of them do you think that at the end of the day are we we going to be able to bring all these forces together to make a bigger movement well first of all I am grateful to both um Jill Stein and to Cornell West uh I know them both personally um and I am grateful to them for having taken the step to put themselves in this situation uh because they will be saying things that no other candidate with the possible exception of Maryanne Williamson but no other candidate excepting her uh will dare say um and so I'm appreciative of all three of them for for doing what they are doing I think it's a small step I agree with you that until all of these forces are unified uh and become a new serious left opposition in the United States States we will not see the kind of change that we need I I I think that's widely understood I would tell you though that just as important as Jill Stein and Cornell and Maryanne Williamson are so too are what we might call actions on the ground the fact that our service workers and remember the United States is no longer a manufacturing country we are a service capitalism the overwhelming majority of our people produce services not Goods Goods production has been exported that's what happens in China or India or Vietnam or Brazil and so on they produce Goods we produce Services the fact that the leading service employ lawyers Amazon Starbucks and many more like them are now experiencing an upsurge in labor organizing organizing unions organizing strikes organizing with the help of social movements in this country women's movements movements against uh racism based on skin color and so on these are very important signs movement in the first place movement alliances in the second place social movements realizing how important labor movement is and vice versa the idea that we can make a deal we the social movements will help you in your labor organizing if you as labor unions will help us in the social movement we're trying to develop yeah this is where power lives and lies and people in this country understand it I do not believe however that this will happen quickly and I do not believe it will happen without difficulty and the reason for that should be clear to anyone old capitalism which is what we have here has had one two three centuries to produce a self-conscious powerful top 10% of its people the super rich 1% and their servants the intellectuals that work for them the top 5% 10% they control the media they control the universities they control the rest of society to keep their position within old capitalism secure that is a formidable enemy they have become lazy they have become sure of themselves because their domination has been so total but they are also making huge mistakes they're making a judgment that they are sitting on top of the world the way they did but they aren't let's be very honest for a moment the last war that the United States won was World War I the Korean war in the 50s they lost the French and Americans in Vietnam later in the 50s they lost the United States at the end of the 50s and into the 60s in Vietnam the United States lost in Afghanistan and Iraq the United States lost in the Ukraine now the United States is losing and the long run prospects for what the Israelis with the United States are doing in Gaza does not look good for them either this is not a record of success it's a record of failure and you're the big powerful at the top when the war in Ukraine broke out American leaders from President Biden on down said that the Russians would collapse that the Russian Ruble would collapse that Russia would be brought to its knees economically none of that happened nothing like that happened nothing like that looks to be happening now or anytime in the future that I can see or that anyone I know can point to these are not isolated failures and isolated mistakes they are signs that the system is breaking down that combination that the people at the top don't understand what's happening do not look like they know what's going on cannot control the situation lose the wars that together with the feeling from below that this system is no longer tolerable that the in equality is unbearable that the instability of the capitalist system the cyclical recession that we expect in 2024 once again the combination of people at the top who can't govern and people at the bottom who will not tolerate much more bad government that's a revolutionary situation we are are heading in that direction and the people at the top have no clue of what's going on it reminds me of a famous book written by an American journalist named John Reed and had a famous title it was called 10 days that shook the world it was the journal cap by this journalist John Reed who was in Moscow and Leningrad during the Russian Revolution in 1917 and he described how the revolutionaries moving in the streets made way for the coaches of the rich on their way to the Opera and then on their way to the fancy restaurant after the Opera and that these two were unaware of what history they were making the revolutionaries knew what they were doing but the people on the way back to and from the Opera had no clue for them the Zar the Russian Orthodox Church the crazy monk rasp they were all permanent they were forever little did they understand that they had barely a few days left I sense the coming together of something like that right now
