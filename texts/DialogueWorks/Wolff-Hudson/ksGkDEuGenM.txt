Secretary of State Anthony blinkin just wrote an article on Washington Post he's telling that we don't have to choose between defending Israel and aiding Palestinian civilians we can and must do both are they helping Israel are they helping Palestinian civilians how do you find it Mr blinkin is helping himself Mr blinkin is helping the United States the things he said are Preposterous they are am I find it as an American embarrassing that he could say such things although he he says that kind of thing all the time we don't have to choose helping Israel these days means providing them with financial and Military means to carry out a war helping Palestinians these days means in Mr blinken's head giving them humanitarian Aid some food some medicine things like that that's like saying I can do both aren't I wonderful I'm doing both things I'm helping you to injure him and then I'm GNA give him some medicine oh this is not this is not equal this is not this is horrible what you are doing because the desire of the Palestinian is not for Aid it's to not be bombed and not be hurt and not live in an outdoor prison which is how the the the Palestinians describe their situation in the Gaza uh strip so Mr blinkin is continuing the policy of behaving as an ally of Israel which President Biden has repeatedly said it's not not me who's saying it they are on the side of Israel and they have made the decision which I believe is is a correct decision for them that what Mr Biden said and what Mr blinkin said in the first two weeks after October 7th was monumentally self-destructive for the United States it sounded like they were giving Mr Netanyahu who cannot command a majority in his own country even as I speak to you poing shows the majority of people unhappy with what Mr Netanyahu has done okay so Mr Biden and Mr blinkin Associated the United States with Israel talking about a blank check talking about standing behind the whole world was displayed that Israel is together with the United States and vice versa when it became clear as it should have long ago that this is a failed policy because the United United States has been funding and arming Israel and helping humanitarian Palestine for 50 years more or less it hasn't solved the problem that's why we have a war now because that wasn't a solved problem the United States was the dominant country in the world for the last 50 years it intervened in the Middle East all the time it was committed it said to peace and to bringing the two sides together okay but you have to reach a judgment that that effort failed if that was the effort it failed of course maybe the goal was something else but I'm not part of their meetings I wouldn't know what they said they were trying to do they have clearly failed to do and one of the reasons you fail is that before you can know half of what's going on they're already making statements we stand with Israel what are you doing forget for the moment what your opinion or my opinion of the issues are but what logic what brain power makes you do that which is why now they are R treating from the incredible blunder they made last week the general assembly of the United Nations voted 120 plus countries in favor of a ceasefire resolution only 14 countries voted against it including the United States and Israel 40 45 countries abstained okay that shows you where World opinion is and it's not with Israel and it's not with the United States in that situation what is Mr blinken thinking to say you don't have to choose you have already chosen everybody knows you have already chosen you used words like we choose to stand with Israel okay now you don't have to do what you just spent two and a half weeks doing what are you crazy you think the whole world is foolish like you can't see through all of this you think it's equal that the Palestinians are going to say oh thank you for treating us equally we're getting food and water while they bomb us and you provide the bombs with which they B that's equal what are you crazy equal begins with a ceased fire so and by the way cease fire on Hamas also but a cease fire on both that's what a cease fire means so this this is a government that cannot govern very well and by the way I don't blame Mr blinkin it has nothing to do with him nor Mr Biden right this is a system that is in terrible trouble it misunderstood Russia which is why it is stuck in a losing war in Ukraine now it has misunderstood what Hamas can do nobody knew that and now how to handle this situation let me give you a simple statistic I went and I looked up the official no numbers as far as anyone knows of civilian killed in Ukraine war and civilians killed in the Israel versus Palestinian War Hamas in Gaza as of now the United Nations estimates a little under 10,000 civilian deaths in Ukraine and among Palestinians little less than 9,000 that means in three weeks Israel has killed more Palestinian or is killing Palestinians at nearly the same number as it took a year and a half for the Russians in Ukraine the Russians have been denounced here in the United States by government officials and by the mass media for countless war crimes all of that against civilians in Ukraine even though in over a year and a half they've killed the Russians have killed very few more people than the Israelis have managed to kill in three weeks and there is no outcry in the United States on the part of government officials or leading members of the mass media about it as far as I know I'm the only person so far to compare these statistics and ask what what is going this is so lopsided this is so scream the the meaning of of where we are that it reminds me of what a famous journalist said years ago that in every war the first casualty is the truth you don't know and you if you're honest you begin by saying I don't know I'm guessing in maybe something okay then say what you guess but stop speaking as though these were all clearly settled matters for Mr blinkin to say that you don't have to choose after the United States clearly has chosen all the way past and present it's embarrassing it's embarrassing ing that neither he nor anyone in the Biden Administration was able to say oh my goodness don't say that that's so transparently fake it'll do us damage but they don't have those people and that's perhaps the most dangerous thing of all because calculations are being made that are made by people people who have swallowed their own propaganda and that is the dumbest thing any Diplomat or politician can ever do when we talk about these endless Wars that were happening especially after the collapse of the Soviet Union one of the main reason behind these endless Wars is military industrial complex they have military industrial complex in China in Russia but is under the total control of the state how military industrial complect is totally out of the control of this state in the US okay the the way this worked in the United States is that the milit to be blunt the military and industrial complex purchased the government that's what they did this was the correct procedure for them it is the logic of capitalism the solution here in the United States was that the capitalist military industrial complex um made sure to systematically grow its business and and and by that I mean to use the particular circumstances and the particular conditions of the United States to to enlarge their um market so the step number one was to capture the military in in other words to make the military do what the business Community wanted rather than the other way around and they did this in very classical uh ways legal ways and illegal ways and ways that are in the middle between legal and illegal but it included donating to candidates and to political parties it it took that form it took the form of hiring exmilitary officials if you rise to the level of general of the army or admiral of the Navy uh then when you retire you become a member of the board of directors of ran or General Dynamics or any of the other major defense contractors why because for the defense contractor an exgen knows exactly who in the military bureaucracy has the real power who makes the decisions about whether to to buy a new bomb or a new airplane or a new tank or whatever it is so there was a constant movement back and forth they insisted that the government begin to hire people from their businesses to be on advisory committees on joint business military planning committees in other words they built a very tight Network the second between military and Industrial the next thing they did was to buy the political um apparatus not the military now but the civilian political apparatus and there again they did the same thing donating money to political parties donating campaigns um making sure that the military used factories private Enterprises producing guns or bullets or uniforms carefully located in each of the 50 states so that it would be possible to mobilize the industry and the military to explain to the local people who you should vote for you should vote for that Republican or that Democrat didn't matter who was able to bring contracts to your state to employ your became an issue of jobs so think of it this way you mobilize the military to really make them supportive of you and then you mobilize the larger political system to make sure that both Republicans and Democrats were supportive of the military because if they weren't they risked losing the support of the the factories and the offices and the military bases in their state was very carefully done it took them 30 years to really perfect the system but it means you know Bernie Sanders is supportive of defense spending because it's his own District included in all of that and he doesn't want to be left out uh so in that way the only new thing is they were so successful that they were be they became able to influence universities think tanks by donating money the money could come from the defense department very important money coming directly from Washington to this professor at the University to that Professor to support their research blah blah blah blah all of that same thing to think tanks giving them grants to study questions some foundations were set up that mostly deal with the military or deal with issues of military strategy very famous ones like the Rand Corporation in California and so on so think of it as a capitalist business military capturing the government the military part of the government then the civilian part of the government and expanding from there to become a social force in mass media in Academia in journalism you know it's been a very successful operation and it has produced a government that is well there was a movie made some years ago with Dustin hofman called Wag the Dog and that's a phrase in English you know the dog is supposed to wag the tail but sometimes the tail can become so powerful that the tail wags the door the military industrial complex became the dominant force in the United States and that's why for example the largest single outlay in the United States budget is the military it gets bigger and bigger and bigger every year that's a sign of their political uh strength so you know you can see it in that way you can see it in the in the speed and ease with which the United States justifies 7 to 800 military bases around the world no other country has that you know the only country that is a a conceivable military uh opponent for the United States is China and China has one military base Russia has no milit I mean this is silly they have been able to justify to the government which they own to maintain at Great expense 700 military bases around the world many of which don't do anything the Guantanamo Bay in Cuba huge military base sits there doing nothing except in in the aftermath of 911 they made it a prison for Muslim uh militants that they captured in Afghanistan or Iraq or Libya or Syria you know because it was they were doing nothing it's an empty space they can put people in there and forget them for 20 years this is these are all extraordinary thing very hard to get any public statement against the military here um is that is a successful capitalist Enterprise it was able to use the fear of whatever they could connect to justify military spending they made a tremendous amount of money in World War II so at the end of World War II the United States government began to do what governments do after Wars which is demobilize they basically say to most of their soldiers you know you thank you very much you've been a good soldier now you go back into normal civilian life you get a job you get married you have a family and all of that um but that would have been the end of the military industrial complex so they IMM immediately immediately developed a new enemy because they had defeated the Germans in Europe and they had defeated the Japanese in the Pacific and so those were no longer dangers Britain and France were allies the Soviet Union was an ally in World War II but it had this other system so suddenly we became terrified at the risk that the Soviet Union would attack or invade the United States and for the next 70 years this stupid fiction was taken seriously in the United States and that's not because the Soviets represented a serious threat they didn't they never did they were no threat economically they never were they were no threat politically not really I mean you know the the the Russian economy has always been a small fraction of the US economy it is that today the GDP of Russia Today is is I think I've told you1 and a half trillion dollars and the GDP of the United States is 22 or 23 trillion doll I mean there's no contest here there's no war here um that can be sustained by the other side so here's a parallel not only is the United States unique because it spends more on defense you've seen I believe you've seen that statistic the United States spends more on defense than the next nine countries combined and those nine countries include both Russia and China the rest of them are all allies of the United States but the United States spend more than all of them together it's amazing that they've been able to do that that's a power but here's a metaphor the United States is unique in how much it spends on defense but the United States is also unique on the amount of Hardware guns and rifles and pistols used and own owned by the American people how is that possible we are now over 500 mass shootings of civilians by civilians in the United States mass shooting is if four or more people die so we've had more than one per day we have over 500 and we still have two months to go in this year with in the last two weeks we had a person in Maine kill 18 people with his rifle and over the Halloween weekend this last weekend we had another 11 or 12 people killed in in weekend shooting so well why is it possible well there there are producers of guns connected to the military often and they have developed a program very clever to associate owning a gun with two things with patriotism but even more important because men are the overwhelming purchases of guns they associate a gun with Manliness with masculinity so if your job is awful and you are nothing and you're paid poorly and you're told what to do you can restore your man out because you have a big gun in your home maybe you know and the advertising is all like that so they have been able to capture the imagination of oppressed men in our culture and gotten them to feel better about themselves as strong individuals because they have a gun and that has boosted gun sales it has caused huge numbers of deaths suicides by gun children playing with guns and accidentally shooting each other but nothing stops it because the profit Drive of the gun producers who have a very good organization to help them called the National Rifle Association the NRA so they go together everywhere and make this all a moral issue an issue of Israel's right to defend itself although nobody can attack it really at this point it's a very pathetic strange moment in history that allows all of this to develop excuse me but the main impetus behind it is profit it's the profit of making guns and tanks and planes and you missiles and all of that just like it's the profit of making handguns and rifles for individuals to use without that drive without the money because you know they they buy the government to sell the guns they sell the guns and make a profit they use the profit to buy the government to sell more guns to and that and and that's successful because nobody has broken it up do you see any potential in this type of economy in the US that is called capitalism to bring this military-industrial complex under the control of the state is that possible do you see any capability in this type of economy to do that well you know I don't want to say it's impossible nobody knows how the world will evolve it's always surprising us but I don't see any mechanism for that to happen I mean the capitalists are firmly in charge of an enormous amount of money look the budget of the United States now gives the military more or less a trillion dollars military manufacturers military uh advisors are highly paid the Consultants are highly paid there's loads of money there that can be given to political allies to cultural allies uh universities are desperate for financial help they have the money they have the connections they have the Personnel that's why they're successful and that's why the only to expect them to change this situation is crazy why should they change it it's very very profitable it has been very profitable for 50 60 years now 75 years if you go all the way back to 1945 so really I don't expect it because there's no reason for it it's a little bit let me give you the a similar example on the other side both Mr Trump and Mr Biden at various times have said their policy is to change China from the kind of political economic system it has to something more like Western capitalism and they actually seem to believe that this is going to happen and they actually seem to be disappointed when it doesn't happen but that's stupid it's stupid for the same reason China has a very powerful Communist party that controls a very powerful State apparatus that supervises half an economy that's private capitalist and half an economy that's state owned and operated Enterprises whether you call that capitalist or socialist it's just another the matter that's what they have and that has made them the most successful example of a poor country becoming rich and Powerful that we have in world history why should they change this what what what makes you think you're going to argue for them they should change it to do what to become like Western capitalism the United States can't grow roughly a third as fast for the last 30 years as the Chinese economy 40 years ago China was one of the poorest countries on Earth now it's a superpower you know they're building the Bel and Road initiative from China to Iceland you know wow what they are able to do why should they change something that has worked so well in order to be more like the United States in Western Europe which are having ever greater difficulties the Chinese are not wasting any resources on War the United States is providing the means for the war in Ukraine and now the war in the Middle East we there's no point in it the American middle military is the same thing they have a bigger share of the budget than they could ever dream of every year their money goes up no significant group of of uh Congress people or Senators is opposed to it in many years the president in his budget puts an increase for the military which the parliament increases is the increase the parliament gives the military more than the military ask from the president I mean you know you throw your hands up local politicians will not be in opposition either because the military has located the army base the gun Factory the missile assembly plant right in their District where they need not to be on top of a factory closing down not to be on top of people losing their jobs etc etc so a peace movement in the United States a movement of working people saying We rely too much on military spending which doesn't generate enough jobs and if we did this and this H that that could open up a whole another possibility you could get a change of of policy but I think it has to come from below up it will not come neither from the military nor from the completely compromised political system military and civilian of the government because they have captured that considering the capitalism the alternative would be socialism what makes socialism a potential f future for many economies as it becomes better understood by the public well I like to I like to argue and I have in my more most recent article that some of your audience might be uh interested in that I've sent to you um that it will be in the description of this video good thank you um the for me socialism is capitalism's other side in other words socialism is the shadow of capitalism I make a joke to people Nothing Better guarantees the future of socialism than the continuation of capitalism when people said to me in8 1989 after the collapse of the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe well that's the end of socialism I told them no it isn't because what you're doing is you're replacing the Socialist regimes from Poland in the north to Bulgaria in the South and in Russia and with capitalism and capitalism will produce socialism capitalism Carl Marx taught us produced him he is the critic produced by the system without that system there wouldn't be a critique of that system and socialism begins and ends as a critique of capitalism it's that part of capitalism that is dissatisfied with itself it produces its own critics so I have no doubt in my mind that capitalism will always have as all economic systems have had people who love it who celebrate it who are happy with it and people who don't love it who are dissatisfied who are critical and who believe that the human race can do better look slavery had people who loved it and people who felt they could do better and the people who felt they could do better were critical of slavery and that's part of why we don't have slavery anymore because the critics and the victims and the enemies finally were strong enough to end that system the same is true with feudalism the Surfs eventually enable the end of the system and I'm persuaded that employees who are the parallel of slave and surf that's why we sometimes call them wage slaves that these people will generate the opposition to capitalism because they are critics or they are victims or both and they will build the movement From Below to go beyond capitalism people have been trying to do that since the beginning of capitalism but the one one tradition that best captured all of these impulses is socialism that's why we all talk about socialism instead of some other name because that name spread in the last two centuries to every corner of the Earth every country in the world has a Socialist Party a socialist movement socialist labor unions socialist uh academic organizations and on and on and on so you there's something there and in socialism the great theoretical tradition of analysis has been Marxism I mean does that mean everything it says is right of course not does it have empty mistakes and lapses and uh yes of course it does but it has survived now the test of time and it is a rich collection of interesting theories and experiments of practical you know taking over a a revolution taking over a country running a country like the Soviet Union for 70 years now running a country like China for more than 70 years and so forth and so forth these are accumul ated experiences of a transition from capitalism to something else do I know for sure that the future will be the one marxists have in mind no it may be different from that it may not it may be socialist but not Marxist it may be neither Marxist nor so I I can't predict the future you know capitalism will try to hold on on and that can be a very long difficult painful process but what I'm sure of is that capitalism never could and cannot now solve its most basic problems and so stuck with those problems stuck with the reality that in every capitalist Factory office or store a tiny group of people the major shareholders if it's a corporation the board of directors elected by those major shareholders a tiny group of people make all the decisions what the Enterprise produces what technology it uses where the production takes place who has the jobs and what is done with the profits or the revenues that the labor of all those people employers and employees alike what is done with it the majority of the people who produced the output are excluded from participating in deciding what to do with it that's that's that's like slavery that's like saying the master makes all the decisions the slave is like a donkey or a horse or a car or or piece of Machinery eventually human beings seem not to like that Arrangement and they get rid of it that's what happened to slavery that's what happened to feudalism and it seems to me it's the most reasonable thing to expect to happen to capitalism sure sure there were people in slavery who thought it would last forever they were wrong and there were people in feudalism who thought it would last forever they were wrong there are people in capitalism today who think it will last forever I think they're likely to be wrong again but the burden is on them to make me believe otherwise because the reasonable thing is that capitalism will go not a question of whether it's just a question of when and how and socialism at least now and socialism means different things in the article I mentioned to you that I sent to you I go through and show you that there really are right now four different kinds of socialism in the world and that's not surprising the future is unknown different people try in different ways to go beyond capitalism socialism is the word most often applied not not all the time but often applied to certain of those efforts I find that the likely place because it has been so popular so successful in spreading over the last 1502 200 years and so I put my bet on that but I think that the the socialism that's our world that's our future um and that's frightening for the United States I understand that because it has been the place uh where capitalism became kind of most successful in the history of that system just the way the United States was not the most successful example of of slavery and it was not the most successful example of feudalism uh different countries have different ways of developing so that the height of feudalism is I don't know Central Europe or Western Europe and England breaks away from that uh early to become the the great capitalism before the United States that's why Anglo American is an important part of the world today that's why English is the language of the world more than any other because that was the place where capitalism developed most fully and but there will be something next three generations from now we will probably be speaking Chinese you know at the end of the feudal period early capitalism you know it was the British but it was also the French why because the French were the most developed Rich feudalism and the absolute feudalism of of the Louise remember if you remember your history so that everybody spoke French in Europe then they spoke English and now they speak English with an American accent you know it is but it's a process of history and and the attempt to stop history is always doomed if you find yourself on the side of History that's trying to hold on and in the face of a history that's pushing forward my advice it can take a long time I have no Illusions it can be very difficult and painful for both sides but where it's going going I think the world has been trying for a long time to correct a direction it took the dissolution of ancient Village economy which was very Democratic and became less so because of a certain level of activities that produced Masters and slaves and Chiefs and followers and Lead ERS and the lead the the that breakup that class division of society always produced those who didn't want it who didn't like it who felt victims of it and now that struggle is the struggle of employees against employers and that is the central driving struggle and it's not just driving in the United States or in Western Europe it's driving inside the People's Republic of China in a different way but they haven't gotten rid of the employer employee relationship it's still very much part of their basic economy and that implies the kind of tension and conflict difficulty out of which a history to a different system emerges Richard do you think that socialism is capable of redefining the relations between the state and the companies like just we talk about military-industrial conflict is that possible in socialism yes I think it's almost guaranteed in socialism uh let me explain if you have a class divided Society like the United States according to the United States census Department somewhere between 1 and 3% of Americans are employers everybody else is an employee okay now let's ask ourselves some questions the employers sit at the top of the economic system they are the ones who hire and fire the employees not the other way around employees do not select the board of directors employees do not select the CEO or any leading corporate manager but the managers and the shareholders hire and fire the workers so the imbalance in power here is staggering number one number two the employers are much much wealthier than the employees the basic relationship ratio of the typical CEO in an American corporation and the average worker income is somewhere around 300 to1 so there is no relationship whatsoever in the financial capability and remember the CEO is not only personally wealthy but is in charge has the power to determine how to use the assets of the Enterprise as a whole literally deciding what to do with the wealth created by all the employees who are excluded from determining what happens to that wealth okay that's how the system works so if there is a state apparatus then the ability of the employers as individuals and as officers of the company they have the political power the cultural training and the money to influence the state Way Beyond what the workers can do unless the workers here we go are mobilized into a massive force that has the discipline to contribute $25 each then you might begin to see some kind of relationship but absent that absent a powerful disciplined Mass working class organization you're going to have a state that is always tilting in favor of Corporations and the rich and against workers and the poor which is what we see everywhere they'll make concessions the people at the top are not necessarily stupid they will understand there's a few of us and many of them so we better give them something give them Social Security give them an old age pension give them unemployment compensation give them free schools give them because you have to take into account how dangerous it might become if they get angry if they become mobilized organized disciplined make sure your politics makes it very difficult to organize the working class makes it much easier to mobilize the resources of a few billionaires and you have more money than anybody else this is the way the the system work socialism destroys all of that if you have socialism of the sort that I I find attractive that I find significant it's a socialism that works at the micro level first and foremost it changes every Enterprise every workplace office fact Factory Store into a horizontal Democratic community in which each worker whether they're skilled unskilled old young white black doesn't matter one person one vote and all decisions are made majority rule if the majority wants to make product a that's what we'll make if a majority wants to change to product B that's what we'll do if the majority want this technology we will use it if the we may make mistakes but they will be Democratic mistakes and there will be this is the crucial thing no difference of employer employee the role of the employer is played by the exact same people who who are the employees the employer is simply the collective totality of the employees now the same people are pressuring the government you don't have employer over here with one set of interests an employee over there with completely opposed interest you don't have that you have one group of people a community decid iding what they want from the government and now the government will be affected by the this group of workers in this Enterprise want something that these workers don't and they'll have to work out those differences but they will be differences of people who are all equally the employer/employee of an Enterprise because there'll be no other way to earn an income in that Society unless they decide democratically that they want to sustain young people so they can go to school or old people so that they can retire or anything else like that those are democratic decisions they'll make and so I think the government will be a completely different institution and let me remind you those of you who may not know one of the most famous uh policies and policy commitments made by the leader of the Russian Revolution uh Vladimir Lenin was when he was asked the question what is the future of this state under socialism your question his answer was the future of the state is that the state will wither away away and disappear now what did he mean by that will there be a a government apparatus to take care of certain Community problems sure he didn't mean that what he meant was the classic marxian idea of what the state is and that marxian idea was and remains an the idea that the final absolute Demand on this state in capitalism is to serve to reproduce capitalism that the state exists to guarantee to secure to make certain that the capitalist system perseveres stays in place it is as marxists have also enjoyed saying the executive committee of the ruling class it is the way that the ruling class sets a special group of people the state in place to keep the system from changing out of capitalism to something else the no Marxist expects the state to be an evenhanded uh arbiter of differences among people it doesn't do that the state mobilizes a monopoly of physical force in the military and that the ultimate purpose of that military force is to protect capitalism here from enemies abroad other capitalists and from its own working class and I think to show you the subtlety here in the United States a kind of socialism exists among people who denounce socialism it's that mass of the working class that insists on being able to own and operate and shoot guns they do not want the government to be the only one that has the guns they want the people to that's a that's an Impulse against capitalism even though the people who say so would be surprised to learn where they get that idea from so yeah the state will have a very different much reduced role and you know nowadays when lots of young people experience impulses that are anti- capitalist but haven't had the education in the history of anti- capitalist movements that many of them these days like to call themselves anarchists people who reject hierarchical political Authority who don't like the state think for a minute that one of the greatest leaders that Marxism and socialism ever had Vladimir Lenin was the famous author of the words that under socialism the state will wither away think of that as an invitation for an alliance or Coalition between between Marxist socialists on the one hand and anarchists on the other thank you Richard for talking about these geopolitical issues I think you talk brilliantly about these geopolitical issues it's so important so important your voice is so important I think because we need people like you people who have experience who have seen many things during their lives as somebody who just graduated from a University who has nothing with experience with the history you know both of them you know how does it work and it's appreciated by me and by anybody who's watching our Channel well you know I want to thank you you may be young although I noticed you have a few white hairs there also um but you know it's very important that voices like yours open up the media to voices like mine so that we are not treated uh in the Marginal Way that the mass media mostly treat us I I like to admit to people I don't think you become aware of me because of me I am the product of the elite universities of the United States and that gave me uh even though my family is poor and are not in any way part of the elite in the United States States but if you go to those universities you become part of that world and that has been a part of my experience here in the United States and has given me a platform on which to work to think to teach to write and so it's a it's a pleasure to be a critical voice even when it is marginalized as much as it has been but I am therefore in great appreciation and debt to you for opening the space as many many young people are doing now for those of us that have tried to understand and that want to give to you what we have learned to save you the time and trouble of having to go learn it yourself you can make better decisions because you have something to build on which I wish I had had more of when I was your age
