we know that there is a war the U.S economic War in China how do you see this war and is it going to influence the China's economy and consequently the bricks I think that the uh struggle between the United States and China is a very important moment in the world history as much for China as for the United States but for the whole world these are the two economic powerhouses in the world economy similar in many ways because of that but also different most importantly in the fact that one is a declining power and the other one is in Rising power and that makes all the difference in the world so let me begin just to give you a couple of statistics about about that the United States has a group of important economic allies together they are known as the G7 it's the United States Britain France Italy and Germany Canada and Japan that's the G7 the bricks are the initial five countries Brazil Russia India China and South Africa now with six new members including Egypt Iran Saudi Arabia and and so on Argentina maybe uh we'll see in the year 2020 the GDP the gross domestic product of the G7 was roughly equal to the GDP of the bricks the five initial bricks here we are three years later 2023 the GDP share of the world uh in the G7 has fallen from roughly 30 percent to 29 percent whereas the GDP of the bricks has risen from roughly 30 percent of world output to about 33 of world output but with the addition of the six new members even more there it is one is going down one is going up at the beginning of this year the international monetary fund produced a very famous graph which was further developed by the BBC in England and it showed the projected economic growth in 2023 and 2024 of nine countries the G7 plus Russia and China what the graph showed is over the years 23 and 24. both Russia and China would grow their economies faster than any or all of the G7 I mean that is a fantastic change in the world economy last statistic so that everybody understands the actual dimensions I'm going to Simply list the GDP the gross domestic product and remember this is a crude statistic that roughly measures the output of goods and services in one calendar year January 1 to December 31. last year the GDP of Russia about one and a half trillion dollars the GDP of the United States 22 trillion dollars the GDP of the People's Republic of China 18 trillion dollars okay Russia is a small economic player the GDP of England of Europe three four trillion dollars each so we're talking about the United States and China or if you like the United States and its allies over here and China and its allies over there this is a radical change of the world economy ever since 1945. since that time remember World War II destroyed the economies of Germany Japan Britain France China you'll name it one country escaped the United States and it went on then to take over the Empire of Britain which existed before and replace France Germany Japan everybody else it became the American Century the American Empire in many ways it was the most Global Empire of the world today in many ways it was the most powerful but it may well turn out that it's also one of the world's shortest you know it's the contradiction it's the hegelian combination of opposites China is a different economic arrangement and that has to be understood because the greater growth of China for at least the last 30 years has been uninterrupted it's not just that they did a remarkable job it's that for the last 30 years the economic growth rate of the United States has been roughly one-third that of China China grows two times faster if the United States grows two percent China grows six if the United States grows three percent China grows nine year in and year out the IMF projection for this coming year 2024 is economic growth in the United States at under 2 percent and economic growth in China at five to five and a half percent there it is again the three to one ratio No Interruption in sight so that's the context and it means that the United States is faced for the first time since the second world war with a serious economic competitor the Soviet Union was never an economic competitor it was a military problem it had nuclear weapons it had huge political influence around the world but it was never an economic competitor that's why the statistic I gave you a few minutes ago is so important to keep in your mind GDP of one and a half trillion in Russia GDP of 22 trillion in the United States and that ratio tells you everything that means that for the United States all of this is new this is a new experience for an American Empire that felt it was in control of the world the dollar is the dominant currency the United States is the dominant source of loans the dominant source of investment Capital the dominant place to go for economic development it is the major buyer of Brazilian coffee or it's the major fill in the blank okay and it has the political power and the cultural influence everybody wears jeans Everybody Plays with their apple smartphone blah blah blah it's the dominant story this is now over the Chinese make telephones that can compete with apple Huawei just released yesterday a new telephone that competes it has even better and faster uh microchips and then the Apple machine etc etc the only real technological competitor to the United States across the board is China yes this country has this and Finland makes flip phones and so on but it's different the only two powerhouses are the United States and China because it is a new experience because everybody today living in the United States was born grew up went to college got a job in a in a world in which the United States dominated it is not surprising that for the American people they can't quite accept they can't quite see they can't quite admit that this situation has changed they are frightened by it they are worried by it they really don't know how to think about it and so they're dealing with China in the same way that they have dealt with everybody else who has in some way threatened U.S hegemony and that has been by a mixture of economic political and Military attack you know if you want you can go back in the 1950s the Chinese Revolution was unbearable so we had a war in Korea as if this would change it and that war ended in a stalemate the United States didn't win that war nobody did it they went all the way up North Korea then they were fought all the way back down if you know the history there the the effort you know didn't stop in 1954 they did what they had to do to get rid of our Benz in Guatemala uh to get rid of uh in the Iran in in Iran right a country after country after country the United States involved itself politically culturally spies CIA uh whatever was necessary to change the government change the regime squash it they tried to do it in Cuba and they couldn't but they came very close and they tried again sanctions political isolation Bay of Pigs in 1961 and on and on and on they are trying to do that with China that's what's going on now it's very frustrating they can't do it because this time they have an enemy with much greater resources than any previous enemy had that's partly because China has developed its particular economic system which I'll describe in a moment and that's been very successful but just as important are the network of alliances that China has been able to build and that in turn is a result of country after country realizing slowly that they all have something in common the danger from the United States and that's true whether it's Iran or Saudi Arabia to take two traditional enemies took a long time before they both discovered that their common enemy was the United States you know the Shah of Iran didn't think that and the previous leaders of Saudi Arabia didn't think that but the leaders of Iran had to learn it and and Salman uh Bin Salman had to learn it in now and by the way I'm not supporting any of these regimes I'm not commenting whether they're good bad that's another question perfectly good question but that's not what I'm asking they decided they needed to look somewhere else and they looked to China and China looked to them and they found even though they're very different countries very different societies very different economic systems that they had a common interest and that is a changing World economic system and that is now underway bricks is that bricks expanded is that the new country is applying to Bricks which are many is that and the you know the American system shrinks it keeps shrinking and there is no end in sight and the frustration in the United States is building because it can't do anything it it cannot succeed and it is very shaken both by the rise of China and the alliances of China and of the weaknesses of the United States and the G7 to do anything it culminates in the war in Ukraine here a decision is made by the United States to put the maximum political cultural and economic sanctions they don't go to war with Russia directly because Russia has nuclear weapons there really is not much other argument the next thing make the best thing they can do promise the Russians not to use nuclear weapons and make a war between Russia and Ukraine with Ukraine provided with the money and the military to fight the war without which there is no war Russia wouldn't take a week it's over so the calculation is made we can win this one and we can weaken one of the bricks Russia it doesn't work we have a year and a half it doesn't work the United States has had to escalate Way Beyond what was originally planned giving them tanks now f-16s Advanced missiles okay still doesn't work Russia has moved many many miles into Ukraine and nobody is pushing them out so the mistake they didn't understand that Russia if you don't buy oil and gas can sell its oil and gas somewhere else to whom to India and China and Brazil and on and on and on and on it when when governments make miscalculations like this it's usually a sign of something wrong in the government it's not it's not just a mistake you have to ask the question why is a sophisticated modern Society like the United States with enormous Espionage apparatuses all the best technology yet make a mistake like this misunderstand what's going on this badly have to escalate more and more knowing the dangers this is a sign as all these are of the dis the decline of one and the rise of the other next point and stop me if I'm taking too long no you can go what is the uniqueness of the Chinese what have they what is the secret for why they have been able to do it and I am going to focus on what I believe is the unique quality that gives them this new position in the world that China is a hybrid economic system it is not the kind of private capitalism that you see for example in the United States or the United Kingdom in which the majority of Enterprises are privately owned and operated that means the people who run them who own them are not members of the government they are not officials they have no position in the structure of the state China is not that but China is also not the Soviet Union in which all of industry and more and more of Agriculture was organized by Enterprises that are owned and operated by the government by this state in which all the leading uh people in each Enterprise and in each industry are State officials put there by this state China started out modern China Mao China China after the Civil War in 1949 when when China becomes a socialist country they were then copying Russia but by the 1950s they began to take a different direction which led to a very major struggle between Russia and China in the early 1960s and eventually a split at the economic level the split led to didn't happen right away it happened later in the 70s 80s and so on but the split led to China making a political decision that had two key Parts number one it would try to become an export-led country in the developing world in the third world in the global South whatever you want to call it they would become an export-driven economy but not export of um oil and gas they didn't have it not an export of major medals they didn't have that either their new idea Russia never Soviet Union never did this their idea was to become an exporter of manufactured goods and the second key decision they made was not to be private Allah U.S and UK and not to be the Soviet Union but to be a hybrid to be a combination of the private and the public and they have developed their economy to be that I'm like I'm not giving you the right percentages but think of it as like 50 50 or 40 60 private and public and the way that this would work this mixture would be under the very powerful control of the Chinese Communist Party so a very strong party apparatus coupled with a hybrid economic system they call this socialism with Chinese characteristics you can call it whatever you want but what is really interesting is that in both the private sector of the Chinese economy and remember it's private both Chinese private capitalists and foreign private capitalists Japanese American German French Spanish and so forth but in both the private sector and the public sector the organization of the Enterprises is the same you have a board of directors who are the authority who hire the people who do the work they're the power they do the work employer employee they even hire the employer hire the employee pay them wages pay them salaries generate a profit which the employers decide how to use for me now I give you my analysis that is capitalism that's what distinguishes capitalism From Slavery where you have a master and a slave and that's a completely different relationship there are no wages there are no salaries there is no profit it is a comp the the the employer owns the employee as a piece of property and it is also different from feudalism where there's a Lord and a serf and a religiously Sanctified relationship of mutual obligation the Lord also pays no wage pays no salary earns no profit etc etc capitalism is not slavery not feudalism it is the next system of employer employee labor market Etc so the Chinese have produced something which uses the capitalist organization of work the capitalist organization of Enterprise private and public but calls itself socialist in a way rather similar to Scandinavia or Western Europe because what it means is that the government comes in and regulates both the public and the private capitalist Enterprises so it creates a minimum wage so it creates national health insurance so it creates an educational system so it it creates a minimum wage it it shapes the distribution of income and wealth as a political objective and so if I had to tell you it's the most interesting thing that the Communist Party of China is operating something that looks remarkably similar to Scandinavia to Sweden or to Denmark or Norway or Western Germany in some way and so on the reason it's Unique is this combination which which the Scandinavians don't have they have basically private Enterprise with government regulation well China has private and public Enterprise in a way that the Scandinavians don't and a more powerful Communist Party whatever however you describe this uniqueness here is another uniqueness China's arrangement has grown economically faster than anything achieved either by the Soviet Union or by the United States Britain or for that matter socialist Western Europe that's why China has the ideological and political power it has in the world today it did what every poor country wants it became rich in one generation it is a staggering achievement for those countries in the world and it's the vast majority whose number one priority is to stop being poor and to become either wealthy or at least solid middle level income where everybody has a job and a decent diet and health care and a quality education for their children etc etc China is the model Russia isn't the United States isn't the United States has wealth but not the growth record that China has the United States has wealth but it's very unequally distributed China has rapid economic growth and that's the number one thing and they are the offering of it and now they have the alliances and the wealth to really promote themselves around the world that's what the belt and Road achievement uh Belton Road Project is that's what their foreign policy amounts to they are helping countries in Asia Africa Latin America develop offering them as good or better deals than they can get from the West because they have the wealth to do it etc etc etc this is therefore a remarkable period a few months ago the United Nations celebrated that the Chinese had lifted 800 million people out of poverty the way they measure it over the last decade I mean you can quarrel with the statistics and you can quarrel with what exactly it means and I'm sure there's some exaggeration in it but it's an amazing achievement and it screams to the rest of the world here is a model to protect and you know the United States in its 75 years has not done much about the distribution of wealth and power between the European American Center and the periphery and so they don't represent a reasonable alternative it's too late the Chinese May disappoint the Chinese may end up behaving like the United States is that possible sure it is but they have the advantage of not having the history of failure in that regard that the United States has and there you have it it's just a fundamental Clash it means for every third world country you no longer have one place to go to get more exports to buy better deal on Imports to get investment Capital to come to your country to get help in building your universities or building your railroads you have two you have the G7 but you have the bricks you can play them against one another you can get a better deal from one by looking and talking to the other these this is going to be a new world in which all all deals are over and new deals are being written every day and you're not going to stop that unless you go to war with China and you can't do that because it's the end the Chinese had nuclear weapons they are allied with Russia which also has nuclear weapons you're not in a situation where you can do much about any of that unless you're crazy and we may get crazy leaders and they may do it but short of that the handwriting is on the wall it's showing us what is going to happen and every other country is now rethinking and re-directing its politics and when I say every other country I mean every other one does that include the European countries yes France applied to join the brics and the bricks turned down uh Emmanuel macron's application okay why did he do it well he's a chief politician so he did that because it looks good in France but he also did it because there's a huge part of French industry that believes it will have a better future aligned with the brics and China than with the United States and the G7 and the French Are Not Alone there is a very big part of German industry and of the Italian industry that feels the same and for the moment they are not in power but be very careful they soon will be and then what will happen very open question and it's also true for every African country and for every Latin American country and indeed for Eastern European countries if you follow the politics even in some of the little ones like Slovakia you know the other half of Czechoslovakia the Slovakian people look like they're about to elect a government that will be like Victor Orban in Hungary and explicitly looking to China it's a little contract of five million people you know it but now things are possible for such countries that weren't possible before and finally why do I why do I feel confident about what I'm saying because the United States has tried now for almost a decade to stop to end China's development to slow it down to end its dominance to change its regime everything fails look the Trump Administration through enormous tariffs at China huge never seen tariffs applied that broadly such high levels I mean extraordinary it accomplished nothing nothing the Biden Administration said it would look at them the Biden Administration has kept most of them going it hasn't changed China's policies anywhere it has no effect China's economic growth continues to be two to three times faster than the United States the discovery that there's a something awful going on among the uyghurs an Islamic a small Islamic part of the population of China I don't know what's going on there I I don't know who to trust or who to believe so I'm not commenting on the rights or wrongs of what's going on there but there is something the whole world recognizes very extraordinary here's a a country of 1.4 billion people and here is a community of Muslims numbering if I have my statistics correct 10 to 12 million people that's a tiny tiny percentage of the people and let's assume they are being badly treated inappropriately treated discriminated maybe all that's true I don't know but the United States with its problems with African Americans and Hispanic Americans and immigrants it is in no position to imagine that this kind of politics is going to go anywhere the hypocrisy the the imbalance here is grotesque you can't do that without awful lot of people beginning to wonder about you it's blowing up in the face of the United States here's a country my country the United States that has gone to war against Iraq against Libya against Syria it has killed and destroyed Afghanistan those are all Muslim countries those are all Islamic people killed wounded made sick country destroyed economy and we are worried about 10 to 12 million uyghurs in China I mean it is a joke it is a failure to think this looks ridiculous it just looks ridic to have your heart beating and it's good propaganda inside the United States but elsewhere it falls flat much more often than it has any success and you have to wonder why would a Country Resort to that extreme strange politics and then we're going to protect Taiwan a small island off the coast of China thousands and thousands of miles away from the United States which maintains seven or eight hundred military bases around the world the Chinese last time I looked have one military base off the mainland of China and so weird so strange that it teaches you that this is a country that doesn't have anything else it has nothing that would strike the world as a legitimate plan it looks to the world like it's a declining power looking for any excuse it can find to attack and create disruption for the new con new Chinese Empire Rising and it wouldn't even be so bad but it looks not only ridiculous and hypocritical it looks futile it's not working and you still keep doing it it's extraordinary and it's the behavior of something I come back to the beginning to a country losing its dominance losing its Global position for of the last 75 years and desperate not to see it not to admit it let me end with a historical parallel the United States was once a British colony a small not all that important British colony in North America eventually the people who lived here the colonists felt that the colonial power Britain was dominating and holding back the economic development of this area and demanded to have some control over its taxes over its all the rest it's trade Arrangements the British Crown King George III said no and so there was a Revolutionary War and the British sent over their Navy the world's biggest their Army's powerful to fight against the colonial revolutionaries to their surprise the colonial revolutionaries defeated them declared independence a few years later the War of 1812 the British tried again to militarily control and undo this country's Independence two Wars two defeats and the British decided we have to come up with a different way of interacting with this new country the United States for the rest of the 19th century and into the first half of the 20th century these two worked out a Live and Let Live relationship the United States got Latin America the Monroe Doctrine which came very well right in that time and the British Empire which the United States respected they worked it out okay the United States and China are very different they're not like the British Empire the United States wasn't the colonial power in China however there are similarities the Chinese want a place in the world in which to function and to grow either the United States goes after them with tariffs with attacks on their corporations with bans on trading with them with the seventh fleet in the South China Sea with the uyghur popular propaganda with the Hong Kong propaganda with the Taiwan issue risking War or we work out a Live and Let Live arrangement Wars didn't work for England and Wars won't work for the United States and they risk destroying the planet so I conclude that the real issue of our time is whether the people of the United States and the people everywhere else can Prevail upon the United States to change its policy and work out an arrangement with China but I remain optimistic about that why because in the early 1970s a ferociously Cold War driven American government LED at the time by the Conservative Republican president Richard Nixon and his conservative advisor Henry Kissinger who was my teacher at Harvard University when I was a student they went to China met with Mao Zedong show and Lai and the Chinese leadership of that time agreed to exchange embassies which the United States had not recognized the People's Republic of China from the time of the Revolution 1949 until the early 70s extraordinary but at the initiative of the United States at a time when it was ferociously anti-communist anti-socialist anti-soviet they went and reopened relations with China and the period after that the last 50 years roughly have been times of growth and prosperity in the United States by large and even greater growth and even greater prosperity in terms of growth in China working something out worked for both of them and that will be the political slogan that will emerge here in the United States it's already happening to say we have a different direction to go and the politicians here who figure out how to make that message resonate in the United States will be the new leaders here either in the Democratic party or the Republican party or new parties yet to form that's why I'm sure that we are at a time of global change and you know as the philosopher once said beware you live in interesting times people who are discussing this economic war between the US and China they're talking about Japan in 1985 is there any similarity between Japan and China I don't think so um yes Japan grew very quickly yes Japan obviously and China are both Asian countries but I think that the everything is the difference in the environment in the context Japan emerged and challenged the United States but in a much fewer range of items for example automobiles were the crucial industry in the United States at that time as they were in Japan so they clashed but it was a clash quite Limited in it in its focus number one the problem with China is it competes across an immense array of products uh on a fundamental level more important than that is Japan was alone Japan had no real alliances with other countries let alone alliances that could or would challenge the United States so when the United States imposed rules and regulations on Japan what was Japan going to do the Europeans wouldn't rescue Japan they weren't in a position to do it and the United States was in a position to prevent them they couldn't go to the Soviet Union partly again Soviet Union couldn't help them didn't have the resources and it had its own fear of of getting too close to that system and they were alienated from China in and that's very important again China was still at that point too poor to be much of a help plus there was the history Japan invaded China back in the 1930s and it behaved horribly and the mass of the Chinese people to this day Harbor suspicions hostilities that are very real and play an important role in Chinese politics instead all of those things don't exist there was no there was no link for example between Japan and India or Japan and Brazil or anything like that uh that could have been a support for Japan that's why Japan basically had to agree if you know for example here briefly a history the Japanese focused on the automobile they produced an automobile that had better quality and a lower price than four General Motors and Chrysler the big Auto three companies here in the United States so the first thing the United States did was to work out with Japan a quota system I kid you not Japan agreed to not send more than a certain number of japanese-made vehicles to the United States they we call it a quota system it simply meant that the Chinese had excuse me the Japanese had been told this is it you will not have a market in this country larger than this small piece of the story later on they were told there would be tariffs huge tariffs that the only way they could get into the market is if they came here and built factories which is what they did the United States promised unofficially that the wages would come down here which they have the real wage of the United States is not bigger today than it was in 1975. because the rise in prices here has wiped out the increase in money wages it's amazing I mean if you look at a 30 40 year period And You Average it out it's less than a half a percent per year average increase in wages well you know that makes the United States worker less and less of a extra expense so the automobile companies came here so if you buy a Nissan or a Honda or something else here in the United States it's most likely made here in the United States the Japanese were not in the position they might have thought so they might have tried but they could not put together the growth experience broad enough in their country the alliance system wide enough in its reach and remember Japan is a much much smaller country than China in population in geography so you know and and they have a complicated psychological history you know there was a World War in which the United States defeated them and dropped two atomic bombs in Japan to drive home to the mass of people that the United States is not the country you want to have as your enemy because they will do what no other country ever did before or ever did since and that becomes a deep philosophic but also politically powerful feeling in a population all the Japanese people know what happened in Hiroshima and Nagasaki with those two bombs and and this is an experience that has shaped their politics of being very very frightened of confronting the United States foreign
