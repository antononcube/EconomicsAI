do they need a new Reserve currency in bricks or there could be something different to get out of these difficulties they're having right now the way to understand this question like most questions uh is historical the problem is we now have and we have had for about 75 years a single dominant Global Currency and that has been the US dollar and before that you had something like it uh the British pound and so on uh in the 19 18th and 19th century you tended to have colon what we should call Colonial currencies in other words the British pound or currencies linked to it uh let me give Give an example uh in England you had the pound and the Shilling if you went to a colony like Kenya in East Africa they had the Kenyan pound and the Kenyon Shilling looked like the British one and it was tied to the British one so the whole Colonial Empire worked off of the British currency and the French did the same thing you even have today in Western Africa a French currency unit of the the African countries they're now independent but they hold on to a common currency linked to the French what we have been seeing particularly in the 21st century now is a desire of other countries to get some of the advantages for themselves that used to go to the United States when the dollar was the Global Currency and that used to go to Britain when the British Empire had a one currency for the whole empire and so on so think of it less as an organized change but more countries saying the world is no longer dominated by the United States economically just as before it was no longer dominated by the British pound economically and that you have to adjust for the different world economy as it shifts and changes so the most important shift of at least the last 50 years so from the 1970s to the present that shift has been a relative decline in the dominance of the United States number one number two a rise in a specific number of other parts of the world most importantly China India Brazil the the bricks countries by and large Russia is sort of a strange case because they have been pushed out of Europe because of the Soviet Union's socialism and then because of the hostility of the West um wanting to somehow hold on to the Cold War um long after it was over Cold War basically ended in 19 889 and here we are we're still dealing with hostility to Russia even though it's not the Russia of uh Lenin or Stalin it's the Russia of Putin so think of it first of all as a desire of other countries to get into the benefits what are some of the benefits the simplest way to understand it is this if you're a small country basically the way you can import goods and services food clothing shelter Machinery what the only way you can import is if you export valuable things that the world wants so they give you if you're Brazil well not Brazil if you take I don't know Colombia so you export things from Colombia to Europe you get Euros you export to the US you get dollars you export to Japan you get Yen and so on and you use that that money that you get get the dollars the euros and yen to buy the things you need to feed your population to build up your industry whatever your desires are the smaller the country the more you have to import now imagine a different situation you need to import but you don't anymore need to devote a large part of your population to producing Goods for the rest of the world why why can you do that because you're sending them money pieces of paper that are useless cost you nothing to produce uh RA in in uh in Brazil or pounds in England but the world wants to hold your currency the world wants to have a reserve in your currency the world wants to transact issues around the world with your currency if that happens then there's what we call in economics a demand for your currency around the world banks will hold your currency to do business governments will put into the Central Bank an amount of your currency to serve your companies as they need it and to have a reserve of something the world recognizes as valuable that's why today half of the reserves held by central banks around the world are the US dollar by some calculations maybe more maybe 60% that's less than what it used to be 80 or 90% but it's still a big chunk and that means that the United States can send to the rest of the world worthless pieces of paper and get in return French wine Japanese computers so forth it's a fantastic subsidy it means millions of the workers here in the United States can be put to work producing goods and services for the United States because they don't have to pay for their Imports with real goods and services they can just send the money okay this would be wonderful for poor countries because they could devote their resources to becoming richer instead they have to use their resources to produce goods for export to the richest countries in the world who who they depend on in their export markets because they are the richest people in the world so there's an example of why any country would like to have it currency be a Global Currency now we have this the next example when the United States sends dollars abroad okay now you know let's let's imagine a rich American Tourist goes to France and takes with him American dollars but he cashes them in to stay at fancy hotels and to drink expensive French wine and blah blah blah all of that and now now the French wine Manu producer takes the dollars paying for the wine he ships to America and he goes the the wine man to the central bank bank of France and he has the legal right to exchange the dollars he has for the French Franks which he needs because he pays his French workers in fresh Franks French Franks he buys Machinery to process the grapes etc etc so the bank has to maintain dollar reserves because it's wine makers and others come and they either want to give up dollars or if they buy something from the United States they want dollars so the bank has to hold big amounts of dollars that holding the dollar earns them nothing so what do they do with the dollar they need to have access to Dollars immediate but they don't want to hold something that generates no income so here's what they do they take the reserve currency and they lend it to the United States government why because they earn interest the government right now is paying 5% more or less okay but we're talking about billions of dollars so earning 5% is an enormous amount of money they want and so what they do is they lend to the US government they buy us treasuries but this is another service to the United States because it means that the United States for example I'm going to give you an extreme example but it's part of the story the United States is fighting a war against Russia in Ukraine okay everybody knows that that's what this is about okay the United States has to pay for all of the missiles and guns and tanks and everything else that they're sending to Ukraine how are you going to pay for that two choices number one you can tax the American people to raise the money to buy and produce the missiles you're giving to Ukraine but then you would have to tell the American people the war we are fighting in Ukraine will cost your family $2,600 next year that would destroy the support for the war because Americans have no they don't know what Ukraine is they don't care about the Ukraine they don't care about Russia you would have a completely different reaction this has been true for all all of the wars fought in the United States since the end of the second world war they've all been paid for by borrowing the money to avoid having to go and get taxes so here comes the irony China is an ally of Russia but China is lending to the United States government the money it uses to en enable the ukrainians to kill Russians you understand that's how complicated all of this is and the Chinese don't want to be doing this the Russians don't like this but what are the Russians going to do if they tell the Chinese don't lend to the United States they are costing the Chinese tens if not hundreds of billions of dollars this the Chinese cannot and will not do and China is the number two lender to the United States only Japan has lent more money to the United States why because Japan like China sells a mass of exports to the United States so they get this unit they don't buy from the United States they mostly sell here a very imbalanced trade so they're stuck with these dollars which they then lend but from the point of view of the United States this is very convenient because if you have the money to pay for the Ukraine war without taxing the American people you will get support for that war and the more money is Lent to you by China the less you have to find American wealthy people and corporations to lend the money to the government to fight the war in Ukraine every other country wants these benefits the Chinese would like to be able to buy say from Germany because China buys a great deal of Machinery from Germany but the Germans in turn buy a lot of stuff from China so that works if however the um Chinese wanted to buy more and more from Germany but did not want to pay with goods and services produced in China by Chinese the only way they could do that is if the Germans were willing to hold the dollars to handle the trade and were willing to lend those Chinese Yuan back to the Chinese government because then they would get the benefit that is now now taken by the dollar so again the big Point here is to understand it's not anti-American that's not what this is about you could think of it that way because it does take from the United States what the United States was monopolizing for the last 75 years but the goal is not to hurt the United States the goal is to get the benefits of having your currency a Global Currency okay last Point what we are going through in the world now is the adjustment of the world of money to the larger economic changes that are going on in the world and by that I mean the relative decline of the United States and its allies the G7 United States France Germany Britain Italy Canada and Japan those countries as an economic force measured for example by their GDP they have declined in recent years whereas China and its allies roughly speaking the bricks are rising that reality already means that the annual ual output of goods and services by China and its allies is already larger than the annual output of goods and services by the G7 and so those countries now that they know how big and powerful they are they want their currencies not instead of the US dollar but alongside the US dollar to have the benefit of being World currencies now you should know that already the dollar is no longer absolutely dominant the way it was it's still the single most important world currency but there are banks around the world that include alongside the dollar the Euro from Europe the Japanese Yen and even more recently the Chinese Yuan so there are already four World currencies so the question for the bricks is are they going to try to have the Yuan replace the dollar as the dominant world currency or are they going to agree among themselves the bricks to produce a new currency not a national currency an international currency which they will all agree to use in place of the dollar if among themselves if they do that then the world will naturally move from the dominance of the dollar to a composite in which the dollar and perhaps the Yen and perhaps the Euro will coexist with whatever ever this new multinational currency will be if they establish that that that is a a struggle going on inside the bricks some countries want the Chinese Yuan to be the new one others don't want that and want instead a multi-national and and by the way Europeans are watching this with great concern because they're afraid for example that if the if it were the Chinese Yuan then it would be the US and the Yuan and the Euro would would disappear or would become much less important than it is now and that affects all of them so these are these are struggles in which banks and National governments and large corporations all have a stake all have things that could help them or hurt them uh and and I think that's I think that's what's going on here um and remember there are odd things it hasn't been decided for example whether a country could be both in the G7 and a member of the bricks a few months ago Emanuel macron the leader of France asked whether he and France could join the bricks and the bricks said no thank you would not let him in but that would if they had let him apply then they would have had to deal with that question in a general way they haven't done that so we still don't know whether that might become possible if Argentina if the right-wing candidate becomes the next elected leader of Argentina he has said that he will withdraw Argentina from the bricks if he's elected if I understand he has a good chance of being elected he may be elected so we will then have a new phenomena how what happens if a country that's in the bricks leaves it and of course the parallel question a country in the G7 could leave it these are all questions that's why I say we are in the midst of a very important historic transformation this is like the end of the British Empire and the rise of the American or like the end of the Persian Empire and the rise of the Ottoman Empire and so on uh Americans are afraid to face this they're afraid to see it because it is a story of the relative decline of the United States and if you understand how World politics has gone in the past the countries with a dominant economic position usually use their economic power to acquire political cultural ideological power as well so if the United States is becoming less of an economic power it doesn't suggest good things are about to happen to America's IDE iology its culture and its politics and you can already see the chaotic bitter divided politics of the United States is already showing the symptoms of all of this you know half this country wants to go with Ukraine against Russia and the other half wants to go the other way and that's if Mr Trump is elected president again he may very well go that way and you would see a very different lineup of of countries around the world so it countries are worried and I mean all countries here especially those who will say we're not worried those are the most worried of all they're worried what will happen to France in all of these changes what will happen to Germany intense struggles are going on on inside Britain France Germany and Italy because different Industries have a very different in this industry wants is close to China and wants things to work this way this industry is close to the United States and wants to keep that relationship so two different Industries inside Italy or inside France or inside Germany are pushing in opposite direction and the politics of that country will go according to which group of Industries is more powerful both in the Waring Industries will each appeal to the masses by telling a story that they hope will make the masses support what they want but they won't tell the story in terms of help me to be profitable because the masses are not interested in that so they'll have to come up with a story I'll give you an example if we do this we won't have all these immigrants or if we do this then there won't be war with this country or if we do this it'll be easier to get development loans in our country and so on so you'll have a debate that's really about which way to go in a new divided world but it will be disguised as something else
