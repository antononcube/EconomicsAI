yeah I think it extends to Europe too I don't think we're giving anyone the Europeans are are now in what must be for them the realization of a nightmare the European countries like Israel got into bed hitched their wagon became dependent on the United States as their military protector as their economic partner as their political guarantor and we now have a leader who has every interest in Breaking from all of that he's going to make a deal with Mr Putin they kind of see it coming and it'll be a deal to end the war in Ukraine or at least suspend it and the every major leader in Europe has hitched his or her wagon to being supportive in Ukraine the only exceptions and they're not much of one but the only exceptions are uh you know the the hungarians and the the Czechs a little bit and and so on but the others are all doing this and that's why you're seeing you know Mr mcon in France you know he's got no approval he's a political dead weight he has no future uh it's even more pathetic to watch Mr starmer in England running around trying to keep going a war in which he was always a junior partner and had no real influence Mr Schultz who's already on his way out because he made that mistake by the way I noticed that Mr Schulz in order to get any leverage for his election has to become anti-trump I don't know if you caught him he's actually he's so desperate that he's he's trying to switch in Midstream I don't think it'll fool very many German voters it might but I don't think so too little too late he denounced Mr Trump for wanting to take over other territory you know that's very strange you know you're fighting Mr Putin for taking over territory what suddenly your great Ally is talking about more territory involving more people than anything going on in Ukraine it it is bizar what what what these people and and economically look at them Europe is sinking between the United States on one hand and China on the other and it's it's a process that is becoming obvious you know we have our high-tech the Chinese match us the Europeans nothing nowhere I noticed that my friend Yannis varu fakis goes around Europe explaining as a as a European Economist and a European political leader because he happens to be both uh that they you know he refers to Europe his continent as stupid I mean it's extra he's a very smart man I know him pretty well I read his work and and he but the only one just like he was the only one who understood that bailing out Greece wasn't bailing out Greece it was bailing out the French and British and German banks who are owed in a lot of money which the government gave the European government gave to the Greek government un condition that would use it to pay back the banks it was Europe taking care of Europe at Greece's expense routing the money through and he had at least the courage to say so which is why they had to get rid of him you know it you couldn't even allow it to be said but I think that's a crisis building very quick I think you're going to see real political turmoil in Europe Europe because the existing just like here the existing Democrats and Republicans prepared the way for Mr Trump's theater you're seeing that same process in Europe and whether the the new face comes from the left which is what you have in France or it comes from the right which is what you have in Germany you're going to see the same basic story unfolding and it's going to be another nail in the coffin of the American Empire because its Junior partner Europe is going to become a tremendous problem and not much of an ally I think you're right Richard that the focus of what's considered to be the war in Ukraine has been Europe all along uh the war in Ukraine has not weakened Russia if anything as we've discussed it strengthened it but what it has done is uh amazingly weakened uh Europe now uh I don't think it's possible for any agreement to be made between uh Trump and uh Putin to settle uh the Ukrainian situation because the war is still still on when one side is winning a war is Russia's finally just cleaning up uh the uh Ukrainian Army uh there cannot be any such thing as a ceas fire or any uh plan for a post-war settlement because the settlement has to be made on the battlefield not uh diplomatically so all that uh Trump can do is say we're not going to spend any more American money on Ukraine uh that will be what he's doing and what he said is more uh you've had his uh uh one of his cabinet ministers saying uh that uh the uh if Europe really feels the what the NATO leader has said If America loses uh the war against Russia in Ukraine that uh Putin will March right through to the Atlantic Ocean and uh destroy uh Europe uh and right and so a loss a uh a settling the fighting in Ukraine in anything less than a total NATO Victory is a total European loss so the uh uh the Trump uh cabinet has said well if that's the case if you want money and you want American Support uh you've got to uh buy enormous amounts of treasury bills uh and in fact you've got to pay the uh war in Ukraine what Trump ha has says is this is not our war against Russia we want peace this is Europe's war against Russ Russia Europe uh and uh NATO countries in Europe should pay for the war not us and of course uh how do you uh pay for war well you need arms and uh Europe's arms industry has been destroyed by the United States sanctions uh against Russia and uh so this means as we've discussed before here uh I think uh in the two weeks while you were G an enormous payment to the United States by Europe uh a reduction in uh the Euro's um exchange rate and a rise in the dollars value against Europe you're having that especially now that the Federal Reserve uh here has been raising its interest rates to 4.8% for 10year treasuries there's an enormous inflow into the dollar and a rising dollar uh Trump I want to talk a bit about this balance of payments dimension of the War uh because this is going to be where a lot of the squeeze on the Trump Administration uh foreign policy is is going to come uh Trump has said I think uh uh incorrectly that he wants a low dollar value so that that will make American exports less expensive he's living in the past uh that was the case when American industry was competing with European and Asian and other industry that's not the case anymore we're de-industrialized the uh the rest of the world is dependent on us oil and US farm products uh and it doesn't matter what the uh exchange rate is they have to pay whatever the price is uh the the actual effect of Trump's policies uh is going to say uh America has to be the financial winner imagine if uh America puts the tariffs uh that Trump has promised on against Europe not to mention Canada and Mexico that's going to reduce America's uh Imports and uh increase uh the uh the balance of trade to further strengthen the dollar everything that Trump uh is trying to do to help what he says help the American economy is going to raise the price of the dollar against foreign currencies so much that this is is going to destabilize the entire International Financial system for instance if the dollar goes up against the global South countries their their debts uh are in dollars but their ability to pay the debts uh is in uh their their their own currency they will have to spend much more of their domestic budget to pay uh the dollar debts that they have or they'll have to default same problem is going to happen uh in Europe if Europe uh pays what president Trump is insisting that they pay for NATO for us arms for tariffs uh that are imposed on them then uh they're going to have to drastically cut back spending well a few days ago uh the uh military one of the military advisers of I think the German government said we need instead of a a bank uh for social spending we uh given the fact that the German Constitution says you you can't run a budget deficit Beyond a marginal amount uh we have to have a a NATO War Bank they've actually suggested that uh uh Europe SE set up a special NATO War Bank to attract savings paying high interest rates in order to afford to spend the money on NATO the five per of GDP this is paying 5% of the GDP for War uh against Russia in Ukraine is the equivalent of a 4 percentage Point decline in GDP uh this means that Europe will impose upon itself or will be imposed by Trump uh the equivalent of the 1929 crash in the United States Europe will be broke well I can imagine many of Trump's supporters saying this is great we're billionaires we can come in and buy Europe industry uh cheap we can buy European companies cheap it's as if the the from Europe's perspective and the inspect perspective of many American investors the Ukraine war is all about uh checkmating Europe and permitting a huge takeover given the Illusion in uh Europe that uh Russia is going to invade uh and uh is somehow threatening Europe by exporting uh gas and oil and making it uh more dependent this uh this uh crazy narrative that is official policy that obviously is pushed by the American uh politicians over uh over there is is going to make Europe uh the this the the most unstable of all of the areas that we've talked about uh even uh e even Mexico and the near East although I guess you could say uh there's going to be chaos everywhere uh in the next six months well the issue of Europe let me expand a little bit to make sure that people understand what Michael just said the exchange rate between the dollar and the euro was about a12 or a Euro the last two or three days it may be a do three C now that is already extremely low it means that all a European gets when a European wants to exchange Euros for for dollars is a dollar and two cents for each Euro well that's a lot less than you could get for a Euro over most of the last 20 years this is a very big deal especially if it drops which it has very rarely done and not for long below parody but that's where it seems to be headed and that means Rel ative to the history Europe is in terrible trouble because it does particularly Germany it depends on it on exports and it it's not attractive because of what the Euro isn't worth this is a you know a a serious problem for them with or without having to pay for the Ukraine war if it continues but let's assume that Michael is right and I think it points that way that we're not going to get a quick end to the Ukraine war although Mr Trump will try for it but we won't get it the Europeans have boxed themselves in they're committed to this their political careers depend on it but they are destroying their own economic viability if the United States acts as Trump has said to spend much less money on the war in in Ukraine which has already happened in the last year of Mr Biden because of Republican opposition in the in the Congress then the Europeans are going to be in an incredible place they e either have to go along with a deal in Ukraine that makes all of their pronouncements about the life and death look like the the theater it always was that's a that's a death nail for their own political survival if on the other hand they have to pay much more for the war they will not be able to do that and afford their social welfare system and if they cut that which they've been doing they're going to provoke the extreme left and the extreme right which has already happened the extreme left in France the extreme right in Germany and that's going to undo them politically which means we have an either or whose net result is the same either way they cannot survive they cannot go to their people who are already unhappy with the Ukraine war barely supporting them and say it's now going to cost you your pension that would be Mr macron or a whole host of Social Services that was Schultz they can't do that it's not a viable Arrangement and there's no golden Miracle that's going to come down the road and save them because the whole world is industrializing in place of Europe this is a very weird situation and notice that the emerging Block in the world economy bricks is noteworthy because it's not about Europe Europe is outside the story The Bricks is the global South there was a rumor I believe it's true that a year or two ago Mr mcon actually inquired whether France could join the bricks and he was told no thank you meanwhile Indonesia one of the largest countries in the world population 280 million people that's not much smaller than the United States join the bricks I mean the writing is on the wall you have to be blind not to see this is not good for Europe and Europe Remains the chief Ally of the United States it is destroying its own allies and it can't figure out a way not to do it and it is irritated with obstacles to doing that and I think you're going to see growing anxiety in Europe with if Mr Trump is able to achieve even a small part of the only way forward he sees this is an accumulation I know this is beating the dead horse but we have to this is an accumulation of problems that haven't been solved the problem of the dollar the problem of balance of payments the problem of internal productivity the problem of changing global trade patterns and above all the emergence of China and its allies with their own agenda who are not held back by the kinds of problems that are affecting the west and that's the story of the decline of one Global regime and the emergence of another we are living through through that but we shouldn't be so focused on each of the Little Steps in at risk of losing the larger picture well since youve pointed out all these complications I might as well add another one uh there's one country uh that's uh just off the coast of Maine politically and that's Great Britain you've had the British prime minister sturmer try to start a war with Russia and aeran by going to arm menia and trying to sign a contract with with Armenia and to essentially uh Way open a new military front uh in Armenia against uh aeran and Russia with the intention of stopping the uh oil uh Pipeline and Belton Road initiative uh that Russia and China are trying to uh extend uh uh Westward uh what what will the United States uh and Trump do about uh uh Britain's uh essentially Britain is uh doing what Netanyahu is doing uh it it is trying to to uh Force America into a war uh with a larger power just like Netanyahu wants to drag America into war with Iran uh England wants to drag the United States into a war uh with uh Russia and aeran uh and probably spreading uh to Turkey as well I would imagine that uh if Putin and Trump sit down one of the first things that uh Putin is going to say about well you know you're talking about stopping U aggression but right now of the your your English puppet is ex uh accelerating its aggression in Armenia what how can you stop that uh this is going to be a complicated factor that uh I think can can blow up just as much as uh Europe I don't consider England uh Britain to be really part of Europe politically and I think Europe has no desire ever to absorb Britain and but I just want wanted to fill out all of the complicating chaos areas that we've discussed yeah and I think it just goes to tell you you know it underscores that we we are living at a time of mounting Global multiple economic problems that are the result of failure to deal with them for quite a while and now they are how shall I put it reinforcing or feeding one another so that what you can't do in maybe in in Central Asia worsens your problem in Europe or vice versa what you can't do you know in Canada or Mexico makes other problems you have that much worse the grandiose notion of deporting tens of millions of people it's extraordinary the very idea of doing that no matter what happens shows you these are very extreme problems if you're thinking in these kinds of extreme terms about how to solve them even before you get to the feasibility look at the language look at the the the tone of of what it is you're going to do and if his his judicial appointments wage a Revenge war against Democrats if that part of the theater is taken seriously then we back to the point that Michael made earlier that the internal struggles in this Society add a whole another uncertainty as to the outcome of all of this there's no reason to expect that this country will be any further along in solving its problems after four more years of trump than it was after the first four years years of trump or the next four years of Biden nothing is happening here that gives you the reason a sense we're going to be dealing with these problems in an effective way just if only things were that solvable Richard uh I don't think uh these are problems they're quandaries a problem has a solution a quandry doesn't in a quandry you're stuck there's nothing uh that you can do to solve the problem as it's formulated as it exists and the way that we've been formulating the tensions and antagonisms at work I don't see any uh reasonable Solutions so I don't see any basis for how either I or you or anyone else can really forecast the kind of chaos that we're going to be seeing in the next uh half year to year yeah I think you're right I think I'm responding if I ask myself why I reason the way I do I'm responding to the fact that people ask me an awful lot as I'm sure they do with you too Michael uh and you too Neema well we're reasonable asking for Solutions so I feel like I ought to try to provide one but my own logic takes me to where you are which is wow this is quite a collection of of difficulties and I can see that we're going to have some remarkably weird ad hoc KNE jerky kind of responses as the quandry makes itself felt uh in the minds of people to whom everyone is looking for Solutions as well if all the actors uh in Europe and Israel and uh Mexico and America were as reasonable as you and I are then uh the problems could be solved but uh and uh uh or even uh we could we would be able to uh ex to say here's a reasonable solution with a a good chance of our forecast being right but how do you forecast people who are unreasonable and I think we're dealing with unreasonable people in Israel unreasonable people in Ukraine unreasonable uh leaders in Europe uh this is the problem that makes any kind of rational forecasting impossible and maybe I disagree at least a little bit here I think history blows away the people that you're describing I agree with you that those are the people they are very unreasonable they've been able to survive I don't see them being able to survive much longer that may be very that may be very naive on my part but I have this sense that in the end in ways I may be very horrified by the historical tension we are now living through are going to blow a lot of these po these politicians out of the water the inadequacy of their Theater which defines their whole careers will make them Persona n grada in their own societies and they will go into fi physical and emotional decline because they they've become totally you know irrelevant I understood Angela Merkel when she explained that the whole point of the deals made with Russia and so on in 19 in 2014 around Ukraine were understood to be PLO to give them the time to arm and equip the the the the Army there the Ukraine Army but I thought the admission was interesting that she now felt having become marginalized by all of what happened that she could and she should say that she knew what the consequences would be and they were what she thought they would be but she wanted she wanted you know the the way some people when they get close to dying feel the need to to say things they have kept secret for most of their lives I think that happens to these politicians too and that I I read it as a kind of admission that what she had been able to focus on and succeed at in Germany after unification was uh no longer possible that that the conditions in in Europe had changed and that the Germany upward and onward as the PowerHouse of the European economy as the great exporter of the capitalist world this was done I mean the between what had happened what the Chinese did and the change in the United States and the decline Western Empire you know Germany was caught and Germany has been caught ever since the decline of Germany from being the engine of the European economy to now being among the worst performers of the European economies currently either in recession or very close there too I mean that is an extraordinary come down and no one sees a reversal of this I think what you said a minute ago is quite correct uh not naive at all the current actors in uh the world political stage will be gone during the year they cannot survive uh in the mom that were going to be seen uh and in fact they have to be gone in order for any resolution to take place yeah which my my guess is probably bothers them if not during their waking hours than in their nightmares
