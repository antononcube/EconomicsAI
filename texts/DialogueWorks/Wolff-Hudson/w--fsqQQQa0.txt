hi everybody today is Thursday February 6th 2025 and our friend Michael Hudson and Richard Wolff are back with us welcome back thank you very much Nima glad to be here let's get started with the shocking plan of Donald Trump and his solution for the conflict in the Middle East here is what he said I don't want to be a wise guy but the Riviera of the Middle East this could be something that could be so bad this could be so magnificent but more importantly than that is the people that have been absolutely destroyed that live there now can live in peace in a much better situation because they're living in hell and those people will now be able to live in peace we'll make sure that it's done world class it'll be wonderful for the people Palestinians Palestinians mostly we're talking about and I have a feeling that despite them saying no I have a feeling that the king in Jordan and that the general president but that the General in Egypt will open their hearts and will give us the kind of land that we need to get this done and people can live in harmony and in peace Richard go ahead how did you find it well uh as you could see among the reporters uh listening a few feet away from the president with the incredulity visible on their faces I must say and I respect Mr Trump for this that if you had asked me what he might come up with as the solution in the Middle East this would never have dawned on me uh he's way ahead of me in thinking of Alternatives so let me start with the few he refers to the poor people of Gaza living in Hell shall we remind him that the hell they're living in is the result of the weapons that the United States paid for and provided to Israel to do that he's positioning himself as the helper and carefully avoiding any mention that he's the cause of the hell that he now proposes to free them from number two the Palestinian people living in Gaza have chosen to remain there even though their children were being killed in record numbers their houses destroyed on a scale that even Mr Trump refers to as hell is it is it reasonable to imagine that if Mr Trump tells them to go that they're going to do what the bombs of Israel and the United States didn't get them to do I don't think so number three Jordan Egypt and virtually every other country in that part of the world has been repeatedly approached to take in more Palestinians they cannot they have said over and over again Palestinians are a major part of Jordan as a country already based on many years of this movement the people who are now in what was Palestine are the people who want to stay there who did not leave etc etc it is it is extraordinary the reference to the Riviera that's a comment that verges close to a hideous immorality I mean in the midst of the destruction this real estate dealer is figuring out how he could build condos on the beach you know uh I'm sure once he's cleaned up all the blood that's on that beach and made sure that it is died so it doesn't offend the beachgoers whose money he hopes to collect I could go on but but this is this is wild he's going to evacuate it sounds like he wants to evacuate the Palestinians against their will which means Force which means means he's either going to use Israeli troops who will therefore never leave that part of the world how could they or he will introduce American troops the man who ran on ending the endless Wars has already bombed Somalia he did that in his first 10 days and now we have a proposal that would in involve much more American Military intervention and let me assure you these Palestinians who have fought against horrific odds and horrific destruction to stay in their country are not quietly going to go neither to Jordan nor Egypt nor anywhere else there's going to have to be a continuous military occupation and even that will be challenged all the time that will require more us or Israeli military this is a recipe for Endless conflict and trouble which it's supposed to do away with it no no it guarantees it and then the nearly moronic grin on the face of Mr net yaho sitting a few feet away from him in many of the clips smiling because you know much of Israeli strategy has been to draw the United States in to help Israel deal with its problems not just its problems with the Palestinians but even more its problems with Iran they want the United States involved because by themselves they can't do it just like they couldn't done what they did in Gaza without the United so they've wanted the United States to get more involved the United States has hesitated Mr Biden irritated Mr Netanyahu by limiting the support which was already large money weapons and all of that but wouldn't do more Mr Trump didn't even have to be asked he's volunteering more what what what what what logic is there the United States really needs to be drawn into endless conflicts in the Middle East more than it already is well the answer seems to be yes maybe the attraction of what Mr Trump called in the clip you just showed us the Mediterranean Riviera is so attractive those profits that all the rest the cost in money in blood in Endless is worth it it's just a calculation who has to pay the costs versus who will collect the profits this is if I dare say so I don't want to be appearing to be beating the dead horse but you know when Empires decline their leaders revert more and more to Fantastical calculations desperate gestures hopeless at least it will be retroactive 20 years from now this will be seen for the Hopeless desperate gesture that it is just like the war in Ukraine will be viewed that way and many other items so that's my first reaction well Richard you confessed at the very beginning to not having foreseen and forecast this uh the fact is that uh I didn't either and uh none of us could have uh and that's because as we've discussed before we take the materialist approach to history and both of uh when we forecast things we think what what would be in the economic interest of each of the parties uh there uh but when you're dealing with a leader who doesn't uh recognize or think in terms of real National interest but just uh sort of exploding uh it's it's very hard to forast what a leader of a country will do when he doesn't know what he's doing uh It all becomes a kind of impressionistic uh soup uh and I I think that's uh what's really been Happening Here uh the best thing that I can do is think of okay let's uh let's suppose we're in Donald Trump's mind you know what uh we've got to make some forecast we can't just say nobody could have foreseen it and what it is so let let's follow the logic of it uh I think uh Trump sees Gaza in the same way he sees Canada or Greenland is uh something like the 51st state is what he's talked uh but I think that of course Gaza is different uh I can imagine him thinking of G doing to Gaza what the state department would like to do to Russia and China uh divise divide Gaza into four parts uh and take it as uh four states 51st to the 51st that will give uh it'll be part of Israel uh that will give Israel eight Senators that that's I think a logical uh thought that uh Trump may come up with I uh probably on the spur of the moment but uh he's probably has his people watching this show now and uh they'll put it under discussion and somehow this idea is going to percolate under his brain um but I think when it comes to his brain there what's left unsaid and unexplained gives you a key to the problems going to come up uh who's uh who is going to pay for building all of these wonderful beachfront properties uh which is going to cost billions of dollars and who's going to get the money from selling or leasing these uh properties and uh who will be getting the tax revenues uh the property tax revenues uh from these properties if you begin to think how this will work out in practice um is is this going to be a us Aid project of course let's let's Aid rebuild uh Gaza uh build build it up America will pay for it we will uh give it to Israel uh to uh to manage and uh Israel will be getting uh uh the proceeds and doing etc etc etc uh that will uh the self-interest of Donald Trump is is in the same as the Democrats getting campaign contributions uh the the you you have political interest replacing national interests so I think we when we're forecasting what's going to happen here we we put national interests aside and just we really narrow and have a tunnel vision uh in the kind of someone who's really just sort of a schemer and thinks of well maybe I can do this maybe I can do that or who's just throwing out ideas and saying let's see what the response to this ideas are it's as if when Trump gives talks about whether it's Gaza or whether it's tariffs uh or other actions he really wants to see what's the response and what does that response tell me of the pressure points that I can use on other countries uh and on uh my own campaign contributors to uh uh get more support uh and somehow the fact Act of linking any rebuilding of Gaza with Aid uh sort of explains a lot of how uh Trump's Administration is quite rightly trying to close down Aid and many of its other things as part of the fight against the state department it all of a sudden we're looking at it a a whole kind of jumble of political control manipulation and uh just domestic us political maneuvering uh that has is disconnected from the usual geopolitical considerations that we we're used to talking about the way if I could build on that I I think it's very interesting that Michael uses the phrase the the political interest displaces or replaces the national interest uh in my judgment from watching it over the years um and from my own personal experiences in Africa where I spent some time usaid was always always from the beginning understood to be an instrument of US foreign policy sometimes referred to as soft power in other words you you seek your objective same objectives but you do it by giving people food when they're hungry by uh endowing a college or helping a university get going something like that and you hype the humanitarian Dimension and you kind of hide the foreign policy Dimension sometimes the hiding gets exposed sometimes it goes so far far as to be uh a program of regime change but only the gullible American public which could not be shown these things believed the the the humanitarian story was the only story to tell many many people including many who worked for Aid knew very well that there were these two dimensions and that you know number one so I don't hear from Mr Trump the likelihood that any of that is going to change he's going to do soft power and he's going to do hard power and the aid will be its particular mixture of that this I don't think this is a serious issue number one more serious is his desire to purge across the government everybody who's his political enemy not whether they've done the national interest of disservice first of all he wouldn't find it out in most cases and number two that's not the problem for him the problem for him is they don't see all of this the same way he does and he can't assume their loyalty which is true he can't so he's going to replace them with people whose loyalty he can control let me say that again then when Empires decline they divide and eat each other up that's what they do look at it this way whatever Mr Trump is doing that exceeds past practice will now be copied by the Democrats they will do after the next election to him what he's doing to them especially because if you ask the leading Republicans they are doing in their minds to the Democrats what the Democrats did to him put him through all those legal Hoops charge him with things you know make him out to be a big criminal and all the rest of it and who was doing it people who in general do the same things as he does but just get away with it more because it's been the accepted Behavior I mean Mr Clinton did everything as grubby sexually as Mr Trump right but he didn't end up in front of a a jury I I understand there are specific differences but you can understand the Republicans are saying every day they're just doing to the Democrats what was done to them and there's a good bit of Truth to that I don't I don't see any reason why I should make believe otherwise I know the Democrats are capable of it all look what they did to Bernie Sanders not all that different right not all that different Mr Trump first you know Savaged the Republican establishment and then he went on to Savage the Democrats the Democrats Savaged Bernie is there any reason to believe they're not going to Savage Mr Trump they already tried after his first term they're going to try again and they may succeed but if we can be materialist Allah Michael then I don't see here a fundamental difference at all Democrats might not say 51st state to Canada because just between you and me the bravado there which will appeal to Americans will make the Canadians crazy and in the long run run that's probably not a good idea and Greenland really you're going to you're going to what forcibly take property away from a fellow NATO member that's an interesting move why you already use Greenland as a base for the American Military they already have bases they've had them there for many years Greenland has said we will give you more bases if you know anything about Greenland it is an enormous geography and virtually no people I live in an apartment complex here in Manhattan we have more residents of this complex than there are citizens of Greenland I believe their population is 58,000 people we have 60,000 here so we beat them and we're just a little corner neighborhood of the city of New York just like the population of New York is larger than the population of Jews in Israel so let's keep our perspective this is theater this is performance this is all of that crap if Mr Trump wants to build hotels in Greenland the chances are that with his money even without the president see he can buy excuse me persuade enough greenlanders to sell him Coastal property and build his damn hotels and his golf courses come on this is this is not serious here he is showing how powerful he is it's all being done in a big rush you know he's taking the canal from Panama there's nobody in Panama either it's like Greenland it's just this is all performance and he's the Naughty Boy the mold breaker the and these are the images that got him to the presidency he's just continuing it's what works for him why should you expect him to stop this is what has worked for him and the old lesson which is you know which philosophers have figured out for thousands of years he didn't get it he didn't get the message he didn't pay much attention as a student you can kind of see that so the old comment you can't keep using the same methods you can't reason it got me here because what got you here may be what destroys the here you got to you have to always do the difficult job of assessing an everchanging he's not doing it he's is doing more kamla Harris did more of what Joe Biden did and that's why she lost it's a terrible dangerous mistake but no one has clued him in so we're GNA have these surprising uh moments like we had the other evening with Mr Netanyahu sitting there and saying that Mr Trump is the best friend Israel ever had without understanding what his saying that will cost both him and Mr Trump here it is from the horse's mouth what every critic of Israel and America in the Arab or Muslim worlds have been saying for a long time and he just said yep that's what we got without a deuring word from Mr Trump who didn't have the presence of mind to realize whoopy doodle I got we have to walk that one back now he may still do that I I noticed that there's begun to be a walking back of the Takeover of Gaza that's already started some of his his assistants are muddying that water because they're they're aware at least of some of the counteracting ideas and forces but it is this is spectacle politics we did see it when he was president before um we were lulled into a a false notion that Mr Biden could take us back to the previous you know Changing of the Guard from Tweedle Dum to Tweedle D Republican then a Democrat and then another one and and it was all the comfortable same no it isn't now the Empire is falling apart neither party can say so neither party can dare admit it so neither party can come up with a plan or a program for how to handle this problem because they're all in the what problem mentality and so what do they have to do they have to come up with aot substitutes they have to be seen to be busily dealing with the Urgent problems of our time because they're not it's exactly the same as listening to Mr Trump and his supporters talk about his mandate he won the popular vote by one and a half per. that's not a mandate That Never Was a mandate whatever the opposite of mandate is that's what it is so he has to say it over and over again so he has to say I'm taking Greenland I'm not going to let trans people uh play on women's sports those issues because everybody knows there's bad things happening everybody in America knows but they don't know exactly what it is or where to look for it so the the president if he's going to appeal to people as a solution in some sense of the males they all feel he's got to come up with a worked out theater these are the problems and I you know we have a problem with our economy I'm going to hit people with tariffs what is that how that works why we should expect that to work nobody asks a few econ economists point out it might not work why because there's a 300-year literature on tariffs because they're an old tool that have been used in many parts of the world in many different circumstances so any decent library has millions of books and articles about tariffs if you know any of that then the the bubble bubble that comes out of the Trump Administration is pathetic in its na in its simple mindedness but that's not why that's a mistake that doesn't matter he's doing he's he's slapping them with tariffs and he's slapping them and he's getting more territory and he's preventing those trans people from playing soccer with women I mean it is this is a performance substitute and what it means and I know Michael and I have talked about this what it means it can work politically for a while it certainly has done for Mr Trump but meanwhile the underlying problems are getting worse they're not being addressed they're not being debated they're not being they no plans being formulated what do you do for a declining Empire what have other Empires done in their declines what are the danger by the way all of that is known all of that could be a debate we'd have but not in the United States the United States is practicing 100% denial it's too frightened of the very Prospect of what we're talking about to be able to diminish it and so it's going to get worse I want to remind you the international monetary fund has announced the results the US GDP grew in 2024 by about 2.7 2.8% and the GDP of the People's Republic of China grew at 5% you've got to deal with this because you didn't in 2024 you're not you have been unable to stop the Chinese from that kind of a performance so you what are you going to do nothing you you ask the question and everybody looks at you you know as if you just asked how heavy the number four is or what color is Thursday in other words you're asking questions the categories of which make no sense because people don't want to see it since you never were told that the days of the week have a color or that the numbers from 1 to 10 have weight you could have been told that if you were taught that you would have known the answer but you were never taught so that it the question makes no sense so Michael and here Michael and I and you Nima we are discussing things which for a large group of people make no sense they look at and they must resp respond to us as what are they talking about when Michael before said in passing and with humor we have a president who doesn't know what he's doing that's literally the situation and it's not limited to the president obviously he intuitively feels the theatric that will work in the moment and he's been right about that well Richard's covered a huge territory so all I can do is comment on some of the uh words that he's used uh Richard you talked about a mandate uh uh think of George W bush uh who had a much uh tinier uh fraction of a percent uh mandate uh basically given to him by the Supreme Court uh when uh he was criticized for that he said elections have consequences uh and in America uh no matter how little you win uh any uh taking power is a mandate or at least the uh party that is taking off treats it as if it's a mandate that's uh how the antagonism between the Republicans and the Democrats for uh who is going to best represent uh uh the Wall Street and the financial Elite are going to win they're they're bidding for the same audience uh basically it's like you have two TV shows on NBC and ABC looking for the audience uh support uh and uh you also mention performance and that's exactly uh what we're seeing uh Trump is uh made his uh great political breakthrough as a performer a TV performer uh hiring and firing people and making decisions about building that's how he got elected uh but I think there's something more there's a a method to his uh uh Madness as a performer and that a bluff he wants to get a concession for something so if you're looking at his threats uh for for tariffs that you mentioned against say Colombia Canada Mexico and China what does he really want uh he his Bluffs are all based on a certain common uh denominator his bluff is we will create chaos for you uh and we're operating our self-interest to do this and it'll create chaos for you oh he's going to see what are they going to do about it well what he has in mind all along is something much more it looks like in Canada what he wanted well give us a concession so we won't wreck your economy what's the concession uh Canada's supposed to spend $1 billion dollar just in policemen along the border to make sure that there are no uh Albanian or Colombian immigrants or whoever coming over the Border uh same thing for Mexico a billion dollars uh border guards can that really be all or that's going to certainly give them one month respite from all of the tariffs that he's promised but uh what does he want more what does he want in in Israel uh for the uh the Gaza proposals uh what this is a kind of maneuvering and he's not sure what he's going to get and he can't tell what he's going to get until he sees the cries of Agony saying don't do this don't do this please don't do this you'll hurt us this way this tells them okay this is how to hurt them to get a concession on something else what concession do I want for this so I think he has a whole uh group of advisers uh the the billionaires around them who all want various concessions and uh his way of getting his menu of concessions is uh to shake things up with uh his performance uh Bluffs uh to really shake up things uh nema's question began about well what about the aid uh for me and for many people on the left and I assume you too Richard the aid was the mighty worlitzer uh it's the National Endowment for democracy it's regime change uh of course uh it provides food uh to some countries uh through particular non-governmental organizations that double as political organizations with uh uh in which CIA intelligence operatives can can work and uh as recruiters for local politicians the aid always have a covert uh op operation and uh again the National Endowment for uh democracy is uh a part of it and certainly uh what you and Nemo were saying well Trump wants to go after the Democrats because uh came out today that a lot of Aid money has been to finance the political blog political Democratic party uh CIA leak political blog uh it's into uh control of how people think about uh the journalistic view the political view uh it it all is tied into the politics of particular uh parties the Democrats or the Republicans and uh Trump wants to use uh Aid I think and the National Endowment for democracy and all of the non-governmental organizations that have been uh getting money is part of America's regime change and interference with other uh other collections uh to re to get Republican recipients instead of democratic recipients of of this money so of course you're right these uh these operations of uh Ned and Aid are going to continue but they'll continue under um Republican control and that of its major donors and uh I do think that Trump is trying to get rid of the neocons within this the neocons are basically the Democratic party's core uh ever since the scoop Jackson uh era uh and also uh the zalinski made an interesting statement since we talked last week he said well most of the uh foreign aid that has gone to Ukraine has been paid to Americans we never got the aid uh if you're talking about Military Arms that's gone to American Producers they America he said has been sending us all of its worn out and obsolete tanks and arms and uh use the money to pay for the military industrial complex to replace these in America's stockpile with new working not worn out arms I think he's right there you could go right down Beyond arms to talk about politics uh the major newspapers uh from Ukraine to Europe are financed by uh Aid often with in uh in conjunction with groups like George soros's Nos and other NOS but it's part of a a world view that is uh aims at controlling how the The Narrative by which other people think of how the world operates to uh make them lead to accept the American point of view and American interest all very covertly so I I think we're doing this but it's not only to shape a pro-american view but since uh as we've discussed it's not really pro-american it's uh divided into the these different groups uh that as you pointed out Richard the Empire is breaking up and you're having some groups work against the others and now we have the Silicon Valley the information technology groups taking over from uh the military Cold War neocon groups that were in the Democratic party so I think the consequences that uh the uh narrow seemingly narrow vote that the Republicans have is well they uh that they got it it doesn't matter how large the uh election margin is what matters is that they are in control and they're going to use the control in the same way George W bush did with a total mandate to reverse everything that's happening before and take it uh replace the class war with a uh political party War uh that is leading uh the class War uh for its own particular interest because uh uh within uh the Le the uh Financial uh the billionaires class we've seen a shift in who is the billionaire class who is uh the ruling class we've seen a shift in this and also uh in the politics of all of this and and in the culture so all of this is being sort of all wrapped together and uh you can see how Aid uh uh was a part of this under the Democrats control bringing it into the state department enables Trump to control the foreign aid and regime change and propaganda and especially the uh subsidy of the international press and the mighty world are uh under his control uh and Republican party control not the neocon Democratic part of control with its with its uh sort of its ideology so I think you know now that we've gone beyond National self-interest for this uh sort of micro uh specifically American phenomenon we're on to something yeah I think so I think that I would hold on to what I said that the fundamental behavior of most American governmental institutions will not change in many many dimensions whether you have Republicans Or democrats because there's not enough difference between them on those Basics but what we will see and I think that's why you're right Michael to push us a little bit in that you know disaggregated analysis direction is that you know here's some examples uh the United States in its foreign aid will not be as anti-abortion as it now will be Mr Trump will replace those people he finds were doing whatever it is his bases anti-abortion people point out we're angry at this project in Greece and we don't and that'll then be shut down or be changed what it does uh not necessarily to something that we would you and not the three of us would think is superior but something which addresses that kind of concern if Michael is right and I think he is that Trump has decided that the neocon approach is something he for whatever reason doesn't want to see continue as a dominant theme yeah then he'll Purge out all of those people and substitute people who are not neocons and then we will we will watch to see whether for example the neocon denigration of the Europeans as allies will be followed by a non neocon policy which I don't I can't tell you now it might be more dismissive of the Europe an or could be less it will have to do with what the ultimate forces are that confront if a dying Empire wants to cannibalize its allies to get through the decline better then that's going to be what the Democrats do it's going to be what the Republicans do with some differences but they'll all be eating the lunch of their allies to give them a bit more time on this Earth they'll sacrifice them who cares about Denmark right that can morph into who cares about France or Germany too and you could you could see the United States it's it's an extension if I may of what we know from declining Empires when the Empire declin when the economic system whether it has an Empire or not declines those at the top those with the power and the wealth use their power and wealth to minimize the effect on themselves of the declining environment so they offload the burden onto the middle and lower classes that's why we don't raise the minimum wage here that's why the Republicans are going to cut all kinds or try to cut all kinds of social spending that's why the Europeans are desperate in that situation if the Europeans do what the Americans are demanding raise their defense expenditures how are they going to pay for that answer they're going to cut their social spending and they're going to get a lot of support from a republican mentality in the United States for doing that you're going to see we're going to see the difference in the same basic policy because Republicans who want to do it this way where Democrats who think rather let's do it that way that's the debate but what they're both doing is the same thing they have different ways of doing it that's as true in foreign policy as it is true here uh domestically that's why neither party questions anything about the underlying capitalist system that's why they have to deny that there is such a thing as an Empire let alone that it's declining I think you're right Europe is going to be the great indicator of exactly what's unfolding uh and you're going to see as you pointed out and we both discussed last time the class war is going to intensify uh between the Nationalist right and the economy at large the Democrats uh have uh based has been supporting the social Democrats and the labor parties on the far right of the political spectrum and the nationalists that we can no longer call the far right uh the the uh the nationalists who want to avoid war in Ukraine and uh make peace with Russia uh are at the opposite side side of uh the social Democrats are the war party basically the labor parties are the war party the nationalists you can look at as the anti-war party because Europe can't afford it and it's going to impoverish the economy uh not that they care about the economy but they care about the very top of the economy that needs the bottom of the economy to uh make to enrich uh themselves so uh the result is going to be you already have uh musca supporting the alternative for deuts party uh and uh supporting the uh separate the anti anti the brexiters uh in in Britain uh as opposed to the Democrats that are supporting uh at the far right of the political Spectrum uh the labor party under starmer uh and uh the Christian democrats under Schulz and especially the green party at on the alter uh nationalist uh part of the uh Spectrum so uh you all of this is going to change the uh political wrapping The Superficial uh narrative uh of the class war but there is going to be if anything even more of of a class war now uh with in the sense of removing the few social protections that the Social Democratic parties in Europe had to try to maintain uh voter support uh obviously this is going to take away voter support uh but the one thing that Aid has done uh that I think Donald Trump looks at as its great uh contribution to political technology is uh occurred in Romania and Georgia uh if the people vote an alternative to you you just say we've canceled the elections we don't recognize them if you don't vote for the americ American candidate which means in the past the Democratic Party candidate uh the candidate supported by the Democrats we're not going to recognize it I think now you're going to have the same uh support of the uh the Nationalist parties uh throughout Europe and uh uh this is going to change some degree of geopolitics because the Nationalist parties such as Hungary and Slovakia uh the Czechs are uh very are being squeezed by the the cut off of gas and oil trade with Russia now so I think that you're going to see the geopolitics of this changing alliances of the class war towards the nationalists uh affect the geopolitical relationships with Russia trade trade in order to project to protect a economies that support the Republican right-wing uh antisocial uh antisocial protection uh aspects of the class war what do you think yeah no I it's consistent with with what I with with what I see the only thing I can add is that it strikes me that the the Democrats made a decision decades ago that if they moderated their political stance if they moved to the right they could get a significant number of billionaires maybe in the in the high-tech uh Silicon Valley situation to to give them a lot of money to take money they had given to Republicans the way most employers had done for a century but the Democrats could get it all they needed to do was be Centrist celebrate wealth accumulation all of the things that you can see in in Nancy Pelosi or any of those other people and the Republicans stung by the success of the Democrats already pocketing employers money did an interesting response they became at least in some of their narratives concerned with those issues that the Democratic party forwent Suddenly It's not the Dem it's Trump who's banging the gavel factories should not move to Mexico he's protecting American industry tariffs to protect the Auto Workers by holding back the the better products that the Chinese are able to produce that's stealing the Democrat they're normally the working class representatives and so the Republicans and look how the elections suddenly Michigan Pennsylvania used to be solid workingclass Democratic states are now not so clear Mr Trump is more of a rhetorical so the Democrats got some more big donors and the Republicans took away some of the base that the Democrats had counted on and they took away enough that the extra donors kamla Harris spent more than Mr Trump the extra donors weren't enough because removing the base muddying the class war Dimensions that are always lurking there cost the Democrats very dearly and I I think again you you're watching the shifting battle between the two big parties when they are forced to deal with a declining economy and a declining Empire but preluded by their own ideological blindness from seeing it facing it strategizing around it and so we sit here with performance leaders while the situation dissolves below us I think that's I think that's where we are and we're watching the performance of a performance artist and he's going to give us something once or twice a week to get all revved up about and meanwhile nothing changes fundamentally except the slow replacement of the de Democrats by Republicans when they're in office as they now will be for the next four years I think we're going to see performance on both sides and I think the litmus test is going to be next week when it comes to the Congressional vote uh or the vote on uh tulsy gabard uh and I think it's going to be the same uh vote vote along party lines uh that it it was along RFK Jr and when you have people of the supposed left the pre the pretense left of the squad when you're going to have Bernie Sanders and AOC vote against uh Tulsi gabard in support of the uh CIA disinformation uh that Trump has been getting in support of the National Security people and in support of all of them the worst right-wing destructive forces in America I think that's going to show uh the the purely opportunistic gang likee uh political aspect of uh American foreign policy based on this pin Pinnacle of domestic uh uh political campaigning for uh office and all of the uh ments and the the money chance and the support the ability to U use or uh government funded organizations to put in place your own political supporters I think all of this is going to become nakedly visible in the next week I I wish I agreed I'm a little worried Michael and and Nima that um I must say I'm impressed by the mainstream media's um complicity whether they're conscious of it or not their complicity with the Trump even even those that hate clearly hate Trump but you know it struck me after the the wild craziness of the Panama Canal that this unabashed colonial grab I'm gonna I'm I'm big and powerful I'm GNA tell a small country that the single most important asset that that country has the canal and being able to run it and charge for use of it I'm going to take away from them I'm just and the discussion what are the precedents for this how would he go about what the commitment of the United States itself an ex colony is about to colonize what the the most fundamental questions that should have been asked no it became a Technologic it's like what happened to Michael and my profession instead of asking questions like Adam Smith what what makes some Nations rich and other nations poor we don't we ask technical questions how much of a lag is there between an act of monetary policy and its effect on the econ we do narrow we never question the system you know Business School curriculum always assume a capitalist and a worker it's as if slave y never existed feudalism never existed work of co-ops never it's what it's the narrow this is mindbending that's what I see and that has to break something has to happen and we're running out of time it's a nice way to end programs like this and here my hat is off mostly to you Nima making these program s happening letting Michael and me and all the others who think similarly critically about what's going on giving them an airing giving them a platform giving them a chance to compete with the mass media could not be more vital than it is now my pleasure to have you both on thank you so much Richard and Michael for being with us today great pleasure as always and see you next and I look forward to continuing this probably NeverEnding conversation yeah see you bye-bye
