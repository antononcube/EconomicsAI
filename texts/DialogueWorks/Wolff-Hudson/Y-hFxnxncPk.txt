when you look at Europe right now despite having inflation and the European leaders are talking about fighting Russia is Russia their enemy is Russia marching toward Europe as Anthony blinkin is talking about no no Russia is not doing those things this is domestic politics shaping foreign policy which is usually the case it is not uh different here but let's do a little history just to help everybody get get their feet on the ground the last four major military engagements between Russia on the one hand and Europe on the other the last four of them going back to the Napoleonic War Wars uh at the beginning of the 19th century involved the invasion of Russia by Europe not the other way around Napoleon led the French armies against Russia and he was defeated after the Russian Revolution well let's go back in World War I Kaiser vilhelm invaded Russia not the other way around at the end of the first world war 1917 after the Russians had made a revolution inside their country France Britain the United States and Japan invaded Russia to try to change their government so uh Hitler in 1939 you know did the same thing with Russia he invaded Russia and he was everybody who invades Russia is defeated might you might want to think about that the next time you you consider such an idea but to blame Russia after what I just summarized as as little over 200 years of history in which four or five times Europe invades Russia and Russia invades Europe no times I mean this is this is crazy all they can point to is uh Georgia in 208 and then um Crimea in in 2014 whatever the exact states were uh and these are disputed territories that have been back and forth it's not it's not a wholesale Invasion the Russians never did that they never invaded you made you made a a about it as part of the Cold War why would Europeans who know better still be vulnerable at least in terms of what they say publicly vulnerable to the idea that Russia is some sort of threat or danger on the one hand and on the other that because of that they have to desperately please the United States that's I think the key question and and here are some signs so that everybody understands what I'm talking about the effort to follow Russia's invasion of Ukraine with a program of sanctions particularly the sanction uh in which Europe says it will no longer purchase Russian oil and gas is a remarkable idea because it really hurts Europe but not the United States the United States never bought significant amounts of Russian oil and gas the United States does not need to it has its own uh oil and gas resources that are very large very extensive and will last for many many years very peculiar to come down on that plan which really hurts Europe why Europe has to face a reality which I think they mostly understand that the world right now is reorganizing itself economically so that you have on the one hand a rising new center of power we've discussed that on your program repeatedly China and its allies the bricks the original five and now an additional six so a total of 11 countries um the United States is the other economic Powerhouse and its allies the G7 um it's not quite as big anymore as the bricks but still close to that terms of size uh now that leaves Europe that's the only other conceivable economic power but in order for it to function as an economic power it has to be unified and it has to to be unified around a powerful successful core economy and it was that around Germany but the sanctions hit Germany the worst because Germany's ability to lead Europe out of the end of World War II depended on cheap Russian energy the Germans like to call their achievement V's Wonder economic Miracle no Miracle at all is just cheap oil and gas that's why Germany could become a manufacturing success because they had cheap energy and they had good skills with machine tools and those are the ingredients for manufacturing so the question for Europe was and still is what role are you going to play in the emerging global economy that has China on one end the United States on the other but China the rising power and the United States the declining power why declining because you lost the war in Korea you lost the war in Vietnam you lost the war in Afghanistan you lost the war in Iraq and you are losing the war in Ukraine that qualifies you for being a loser you can't Prevail all your nuclear weapons are not helping you you can't use them and when you fight on another terrain you don't have the preponderance to win those Wars that's why you're not so the Europeans had to face this reality the problem for the Europeans is that the United States also is facing the same reality and the United States made a decision about depending on how you count 10 or 12 years ago that they had made a mistake it's important to to understand that they recognized they had made a mistake because it is very hard for American officials ever to say that they've made a mistake um even when the mistake is obvious and immense but here they went so far as to say Yes we made a mistake the mistake was in their view opening World economy to China having Kissinger and Nixon back then go to China bring China into the World Trade Organization normalize relations Etc they believed that China would then become the kind of global uh country that the United States was comfortable with they learned by 2010 that China had its own ideas about its its role in the world uh wasn't the American idea that they could compete with the United States they knew that by 2000 uh that they could defeat the United States in competition they knew that by 10 thou 2010 so the United States decided to change its policy it said goodbye to neoliberalism it said goodbye to globalization it said goodbye to free trade it said goodbye to less a fair economics keep the government out oh it kept those things for domestic politics but not in terms of its goal it had a rightwing president Trump declare that the major thing he was going to do was a tariff war against China a war against China what Trump initiated and what Biden has continued is a new program of economic nationalism the United States government will become the supplier the subsidize the protector of us capitalism in a struggle in which the enemy is China Russia and the bricks all right where then does the United States see Europe answer they want Europe to ease the struggle between the United States and China they want the costs of that struggle to be bor Bor by Europe but the benefits of this struggle to flow to the United States how are they going to get that done and what is their biggest fear the biggest fear the biggest obstacle is that the Europeans will actually take seriously the old European idea after world World War II of creating an economic Union a a European Union that would bring together all of the skills and Agriculture and Industry and services of Europe to make it the PowerHouse that it could be it has agriculture it has industry it has high technology it has nuclear weapons it has it has but the United States doesn't want Europe to do that on its own that weakens the United States in the worst case scenario from the American view the Europeans might deide to side with the bricks it's very clear that there would be much support inside Europe for siding with the bricks the support of European business businesses leading the way so for American policy it became crucial to figure out how could you draw the Europeans in to an alliance where they play a secondary role where they absorb the costs of the struggle with China and they do for the United States what the United States wants at their own expense and let me give you again some examples for many years Denmark was a neutral country it announced itself as neutral it committed itself to neutral and one of the foundational parts of it its commitment to neutrality was to prevent any presence on Danish soil of troops from a foreign country that the only soldiers active in Denmark would be Danish nobody else last December quietly without public discussion and without public debate the Danish government passed an irreversible Believe It or Not 10year commitment that Americans will be able to station American troops on Danish soil when the Danish government announced this to its own people it said there can't be uh a distance greater than a a piece of paper between Denmark and the United States and then a long discourse about the dangers of an Invasion From Russia which if you know your geography would have to lift leap over several other countries even to get there and while I enjoy Danish butter and danish cheese and danish eggs and inv over a grand distance for people who don't want you is a high price to pay for cheese and milk and eggs it's stupid well it's also grotesque by stationing American troops Denmark becomes a Target if those troops have weapons then the then Russia defends itself by neutralizing those weapons just as it has neutralized all of the weapons sent by all the European countries to Ukraine they have not change the reality on the ground Russia is winning and Ukraine is losing well then what is it that the United States gets and we have seen pretty Craven meltdown Europe does nothing nothing the nordstream pipeline to give Europe cheap energy for decades into the future is blown up in a kind of Hollywood movie activity and it's obvious that this is not good for the countries of Europe who were there to buy the gas that comes out at that end of the pipeline they don't do anything the swedes have some boat looking for for camera pictures of it's childish that's that's a move that should have had the Europeans enraged even before Seymour hirs writes the article that shows it was us uh activity okay so the answer to my question I'm going to give you a fantasy story and I don't know that what I'm about to say actually happened I have no inside information I read the same newspapers you do and that's where I get it but I imagin 10 years ago a meeting on one side American State Department officials and the military on the the other hand side European officials and European mil military and the US side says to them here's what we think you need to do Europe you need to help us fight the Chinese and if you do and if you behave appropriately then we will happily help you you when you have troubles but if you don't help us if you are not Cooperative we will have no choice but to assume that you are not friendly in this struggle that you are not neutral even if you say so and at that point we are going to look for ways to isolate and neutralize you and and then looking at the head of Denmark or the head of Sweden or the head of Portugal or the head of Ireland or any of the others the Americans will say we will work a deal with Ireland because you don't let us work one with you it's not that we prefer the Irish it's not even that we prefer you we make the decisions based on where we need a submarine base where we need a own base where we might do the we're going to we're going to really hamper the Russians so we want you to do that and here's your danger you don't have to do it but if you don't you make us an enemy and you don't want us as an enemy and we don't want to be your enemy so make it easy for us here's the argument Russian invasion Russian invasion protect from the Russians protect from there it is there yeah your population is ready for that because they got that for 75 years of the Cold War so they're used to it Putin even sounds a little like Stalin make the connection amazing things are said Putin has devoted himself systematically to bringing back nothing of the Soviet Union he doesn't want socialism none of it it doesn't matter another stal this is crazy but on the one hand it isn't crazy at all because each European government reasons this way we have to be pro-american it's too dangerous for our government in Paris or Rome or filling the blank it's too dangerous for us to be the one or the two or the three it's not enough so the reality is we're going to be cheering on the Americans even though it looks to the whole world that we are busily shooting ourselves in the foot the sanctions program against Russia is good for the United States good for Russia and terrible for Europe that's the reality you know many years ago coming out of the depression Roosevelt and the United States went to war the second world war and that war they took half their people who were unemployed and put them in the military and they took half the other half of the unemployed and put them into factories making the guns bu bullets and uniforms for the military they got a booming economy and full employment by means of War have people forgotten that Mr Putin just did the exact same thing he took a Russian economy which while not in a Great Depression had a lot of problems since 1989 and he solved those problems by giving the economy an enormous Keynesian militarism boost so he comes out of the economy a popular leader more popular than any European leader and more secure in his position the European are trembling everywhere it's not clear that maon in France can survive his next election or that Olaf Schulz can do so the Polish people have already upset their government with a new uh a newly elected government and so on you you're going to see tremendous turmoil because for one the business community in Europe they don't want any of this they're going along with their political leaders because they always have they feel more comfortable with American economic leadership than Russian I get all that but those are the same businesses that don't want to see their business destroyed replaced by cheap Chinese or cheap Russian substitutes and that's what's coming so you if you put it together you are watching a Europe being divided dominated and subordinated to the United States even as the US demands of it to Bear the most burdensome costs of of that foreign policy whether it be in Lo losing cheap energy which is by far the most important or whether it's in some other form you know demanding that they don't use Huawei uh electronics because the United States hasn't and things like that Europe is in a very very bad and dangerous place it has to make it decision and it has to make it now between two opposing forces China and its allies on the one hand China and the bricks versus the US and the G7 it has to decide where to bet its own future if it succeeds it will be in the future what Europe has been for the last three or four or 500 years but if it makes the mistake and goes too quickly to one side or the other then it is looking at a long steady period of disaster then the future of Europe is to be what Britain already is a cold wet offshore island doing the bidding of the United States and in fact indistinguishable from being the 51st state of the union rather than a proud people from whom the United States is descended it's a remarkable change but it's it's Europe's decision and it's a European process that will decide whether United States dominates in the years ahead or the United States comes to terms with a new power force which would be called and would have to be called the American diaspora when the United States is forcing Europe to allocate more money to military-industrial complex who's going to benefit from this type of policies well you've answered your own question this is the military industrial complex they see an opportunity here they are quite right that opportunity is there for them and they're going to go get it and they're going to increase the military spending the United States has every interest in supporting their doing that so long long as the European military industrial complex is not independent that's why they need to have a Danish person at the head of NATO and you know mix it all up and get the little countries involved uh and make the political careers of the leaders whoever they are now dependent on carrying through this sort of policy and if they're going to spend more money on the military it means they're going to spend less on everything else one of the biggest outlays of the French government are subsidies to Farmers and that's why the French farmers are in the streets because they're protesting the pressure not to give them the money because they're giving so much to Ukraine or they're giving so much to Phil in the blank eventually this is how this game is played and you'll have varying pressure groups lined up against the military industrial complex and then I I make a prediction which I rarely do I don't believe in it but I'll make one right now the strongest voices against Europe capitulating to the United States come from the political right from Marina Leen in France from Victor Orban in Hungary and people like that but when you look at their proposals for how to deal with the European economic crisis moment nothing they have no solution they want to talk to you about how horrible Syrian immigrants are you have a million more a million less not going to solve your problem this just not you have no solution so if I were advising them I'm not but if I were I would say to them you know you may be able to take power if the situation falls apart in your favor but you don't know what to do and you have no solution so the people are going to notice this after a while maybe two weeks maybe two months maybe two years and then will be the moment where the left comes in and says they have no solution and I said if I'm really honest with you I would tell you that the leftwing leaders and I do meet with them they don't have a solution either and they're very hesitant to take the solutions that are offered and presented to them but my guess is you're going to see a right-wing swerve and then a leftwing swerve in this whole situation and it'll be a sign to those that run capitalism that they better start paying attention because all of the old issues that capitalism faces when it breaks down War threat of War fascism they're all coming back because they are all provoked by the disintegration of capitalism and what we have is a variation the dis disintegration of us Capital brings them right here to the front and center with what it is they have to do Emmanuel macron recently said that if Russia wins the war in Ukraine it's going to be a huge security problem for Europe when you look at Russia their behavior as you mentioned so far they have been fighting in Ukraine for 19 months they were not willing to pass the NEPA River even the NEPA River how it's going to be a huge security problem for Europe and in your opinion the future of security for Europe would be with Russia or without Russia and if you were to advise Europeans what would you say to them I would say to them that their best hope is to be what they once hoped they would be would be an independent not allied with the United States not allied with Russia China but to be a third whole and to be able to make social experiments of the sort that social democracy was uh after World War II that's what they ought to do Mr M makes those statements only because he is afraid he is afraid that he will be the one to turn against the United States he'll be the only one he'll be isolated uh the Americans will give advantages to the Germans the Spanish the Italians that they wouldn't give him uh it it would be a very bad competitive situation for the United States and they're afraid they haven't done that you know Mr mcon was rumored and he never denied it that he asked for membership in the bricks that that my My Hope Is that Europe led by the French or anybody else tries to actually find an independent way this becomes more and more difficult to do but I'm afraid afid if I were honest with you I'd have to say to you if you can't try independent then you better be careful before you simply assume you go to the US to pin your hopes on the US is to pin your hopes on a demonstrated loser and this is a very strange thing for the Europeans to do but they're terribly afraid of what what can happen to them if they become the enemy of the United States look most Europeans believe that the Russia Hamburg um gas pipeline was blown up by the United States so if things are at that point what are they going to think about you know in terms of these issues but they better make a decision quickly because what's happening now is that the United States is able to force one then the other then the o to terrify each of them by saying you know if you're the one who makes a statement against us we will have to think of you as an enemy and then you know we're sorry nothing against you but we have to get rid of you and we have to replace you with somebody who's going to talk about Russia invasions even though youve never had one uh etc etc etc if the US government illegally confiscates 300 billions in Russian assets what message would they send to Chinese government that message has been sent and that message has been received years ago every effort is being made by those other countries to remove their lines of dependence on the United States or to reduce them to the minimum they cannot go beyond that is a major priority they devote huge amounts of resources to dealing with that reality so that's already gone and look the efforts of the United States have failed I mean the United States has punished particular companies huwei Corporation it made no difference they announced they were going to have a tariff War to teach the Chinese the importance of a rules-based international order the Chinese laugh they're not in a position to do it anymore more and more countries that have a problem whether the problem is building a railroad they need or in enlarging their army or getting a loan for a dam um they now have a second option they don't just have to go to London or Rome or New York they go to those places but they are told no we can't do it here so then they go and they pack their bag for sa Paulo that's what they do but they're doing it now and they're used to doing it and when they go to those countries they are often given a better opportunity dealing with a bricks loan or a bricks Grant or a bricks commitment than what they got before from the United States or from that kind of a law so yep they understand there's going to be a period of trouble if they start selling you treasuries what would be the consequences of this type of decisions by these countries for the US economy well they a number of those countries have been doing that if you follow the Chinese it's very clear the last few years they have they still have a lot they're still number two but they're not number one and they have several hundred billion dollars less um of us Treasures than they had before it's making life much more difficult for the United States it means the United States is going to have to spend a ridiculous amount of money paying off its debt and that's money that's not going to be so easy uh to get replaced what do you do do you stop spending on social programs that blows up your in unequal Society if you can't borrow money how you going to fight Wars the American people will not pay the taxes to fight a war they will pay interest but now the interest is going to become hundreds of billions and then into the trillions just to pay for the interest you know this is not a manageable situation and anyone who tells you it is is just playing there are people who believe that the noise around using Russia assets to give a an award to Ukraine is a terrible idea and these are people are very anti-russian but they think it's a terrible idea because it's United States no longer even pretending to be neutral the whole idea was to move the court of justice and all of these things into this quasi super natural Supernatural entity and the fear is that that's that that's over but that's dangerous for the United States perhaps in the way you were thinking that they only bought those treasuries because it was a very liquid way to hold your assets maybe that'll all change most dramatically maybe when you if you see a decline of the US you're going to see a market in international treasuries that has many more countries participa there are ideas like that floating around but for the moment they are just ideas why we don't have any alternative in Israel to the N Administration in his party and no no no no but we do we do have absolutely there is an enormous OPP uh opposition inside Israel opposition to Netanyahu as leader opposition to the Coalition that he has gathered around him which is the most right-wing Coalition in Israeli history they were defeated just before the October events they were defeated in an effort to change the rules of the Supreme Court and the Judiciary by a mass movement in the streets no no no the the opposition the irony of Israel is the opposition inside Israel is stronger than outside that the Jewish population outside Israel is either divided which is true for much of it that he is divided pro-israeli or Pro Palestinian or even if they're pro-israel they're horrified by what they are doing in the Gaza the the the absence of a ceasefire and so on and so this is a situation that is probably going to come to an end pretty quickly because for the United States this is becoming irrelevant they they they support Israel because that's who they have always supported the Arab countries are interested in the Bricks now that both Saudi Arabia and Iran uh and Egypt are members of the bricks uh you know Israel will never be etc etc this is a fast changing situation but there is a big opposition and it's not clear exactly what will be necessary for this opposition to be become dominant but it sure looks like it could be any moment uh in time when when serer heads will pre Prevail there and they'll find some other solution but because Israel has not found another solution for a long time this is a very difficult what are you going to do with the Israeli people what are you going to do with the Palestinian people who make the same claim over the same land this is difficult and you have not a a history of making very successful efforts to deal with it so you are now stuck but you know maybe a lesson will be learned it's better to come to some sort of resolution earlier that has the power to survive than to keep this going the the I mean I I am no expert here and I don't pretend it but given the the kind of dam image that I assume Israeli Defense Forces have imposed on the people of Gaza you are going to see well the best way I can put it you're going to see a generation of the children of Hamas who are going to be thinking about doing in Israel what these other people did in October uh I hope not but I'm not hopeful in terms of what is is likely to happen and and and to a lesser extent on the side of Israel as well they are developing their own extremists um I am sure as fast if not faster than whoever it is they kill it was the same United States made that mistake in Afghanistan it made the same mistake in Vietnam yeah you killed a lot of Vietnamese but in the process you converted their children their cousin their Uncle their mother into an enemy because of what you did you can't solve your problem that way you've got to try to solve it in a way that breaks with this pattern and you don't have this you know Hamas and Netanyahu provoke one another that's not my guess as to what might happen that's already the reality of the past
