hi everybody today's Thursday March 133 2025 and our friends Michael Hudson and Richard wol are back with us welcome back thank you glad to be here good let's get started with the negotiations between the first round of negotiations between the Trump team and the Trump Administration and ukrainians the conclusion of this discussion were a 30day ceasefire proposed by the United States to the Russians Michael how do you find the way that Donald Trump is trying to manage the situation with considering Ukraine well it looks on the surface like a complete about face by Trump uh the pro whole proposal for a ceasefire seems so bizarre and so out of place that it doesn't make any sense on the surface a ceasefire enables armies to retreat and uh England and France have said they're going to send in peacekeepers and lav said peacekeepers are from the country that says Russia is our existential enemy and wants to destroy it uh their kind of peacekeepers is uh to fight Russia to move up to uh the current line uh so uh as to prevent Russia after the one Monon ceasefire is over from uh continuing its movement to settle the whole uh peace agreement on the battlefield that's what wars do they settle the problems on the battlefield uh and uh there's no need for a ceasefire to uh ha have negotiations during World War I during every war is a Wars coming to an end they six months maybe a year of negotiations what are we going to do how do we prepare for the peace uh somehow the newspapers have followed uh something that seems to be orchestrated as if uh there can't be any solution to the war without a ceasefire and negotiations and discussions go together and uh that that's uh just silly that's not what happens and what does a month mean for a ceasefire maybe Putin can say well give us a month well all right maybe four months and we'll achieve peace will finish the military operation it'll all be over in four months so what we're going to give you peace but uh ceasefire would simply stretch out the fighting we want to end it let our army just go on and uh we will uh arrange uh a kind of peace that will really be lasting not just setting up Europe versus uh Russia kind of antagonism and in Le leov had a long discussion with napolitano's group that's been uh all over the Internet and Lov said why should we agree to a peacemaking force of some kind of peacemaking group if they want to force the such a force to consist of countries that have declared us as an enemy while will they uh really come as peacekeepers so even the facts are unclear I don't know whether Trump really uh stopped sending arms to Ukraine because uh a few days ago yesterday uh we uh Russia sent uh new missiles to bomb a second ship that was delivering new arms to Odessa and uh blew it up so somebody's sending arms and uh then when you have the Drone attack on Moscow somebody must have been steering uh the drones from a satellite and Trump says well we've uh turned off the satellite and information we're not giving it to Ukraine but then if America's part of the five eyes and England is into the five eyes not to mention Canada maybe England sent is sending the information to Ukraine so the question is H any agreement that is made with Trump somehow leaves Europe out and uh Trump can say oh okay the uh the Russians sto fighting but the Europeans oh that's a separate thing we can't control them they're doing what we want so the question is what is what is really happening what is Trump's strategy well Alistar crook uh thinks that Trump really hates war and uh wants to create a a world without war and free for big business to do what Richard and I talked uh last week about to establish a right-wing uh right-wing government business government throughout the world uh in in making uh money and peace but I really uh there's no indication of whether Trump really wants peace or not I'm sure that Trump wants to fight against the CIA and the neocons who are fighting him in 2016 and in 2020 and even in this last 2024 election I'm sure he wants to get rid of his enemies in the Deep State and that means stopping the war so why would he have made a proposal to Russia that Russia cannot possibly accept uh except on terms of uh surrender that's that's the question that we have to ask and it just doesn't make sense didn't telsey or some other advisers tell them this is a no-go uh the Russians want to Defuse The Cold War but not let uh uh Ukraine just rearm and uh keep it going going uh and the subsequent followup by Trump and re and Rubio shows that well uh what they want peace is and peace is uh uh preventing Russia from reinvading uh Europe like it did in 1945 peace is this this fantasy that somehow uh Europe has to defend itself against Russia invading Europe as we've discussed before Russia has no motivation to do that and the cost of any country invading another is so great that no country can afford it and survive any kind of election so maybe we've all been had uh if we take Trump as a word his word uh it turns out that his sort of grandstand promised to bring bring peace in Ukraine well it turns out there are different kinds of peace there's a beligerent peace of defeating Russia and there's the Russian piece of defeating Nazism in Ukraine which is it which is it going to be rer yeah I noticed I won't repeat what Michael said there's no need uh let me point to a few other things I find remarkable here uh number one will a ceasefire even if you have one I noticed that in the same statements that Rubio Waltz and the others made coming out of the negotiation in the same statement about a ceasefire was the statement that they are resuming providing them with intelligence and arms and and everything that was suspended is be well what kind of a ceasefire would that even be then would they continue they didn't even even say that in the event of a ceased fire they would continue to not at all they said we want a cease fire and we have resumed uh what you know and that's not a minor matter to be negotiated later if you mean to cease fire then you would require a that the United States commit to not providing more material L During the period of the ceasefire and you would probably make a demand on the Europeans Allah what Mark Michael was saying to do the same otherwise this is a shell game this is this is Foolery this is not serious and and that's a lapsis that makes me very suspicious also about what exactly what is what is showing here what is a theater and what is a reality second this is a bizarre situation there's a war between Ukraine and Russia a negotiation would then be between Ukraine and Russia we now have a a three-way this is like going on a really important date with your beloved and somebody else it's not a question of who the other one is it's a question well either this is a date or it isn't but it isn't three unless what you have in mind is quite different from what I have in mind you know etc etc so did the United States is playing a very bizarre role and then the final thing for me is it's even more bizarre because both of the others Mr zalinski 50 times in the last two years has said he doesn't want to cease fire and and lavro and Putin and pesov their spokesperson have said the same thing they don't want to ceas fire and they've said it repeatedly over the LA so we have two sides committed to no ceasefire being brought together by the United States which wants to ceas fire very bizarre uh situation at least I'm no historian of negotiations but I find all of this very very bizarre and then that at the end of the official statement there is this remarkable line and it says the Ukrainian side made the point that they want the Europeans to be quote some how involved now think a minute it's not that the United States and Ukraine agreed that the Europeans no no it's it's very clear that the ukrainians want them involved and by the Silence of the United States the suggestion is they don't or they don't care enough and this is H how do you negotiate the end of a war in Europe minus the Europeans plus the I find this very very bizarre and it it it poses as they like to say it poses more questions than it answers so I'm I'm wondering how the how the Russians are going to react but the this looks like a slapped together negotiation somebody wanted their to be something in in Saudi Arabia that could look like progress so they went and they had a meeting and they used up four or five days of some kind of progress and now everybody wonders now what because nothing was thought through about where this goes or how in the world it could proceed given the disinclination on both sides the Russians don't want to give the the the uh ukrainians a chance to regroup and rearm and why should they you know and the and the the irony is the Russians could also of course regroup and rearm that's what they would likely do that's what usually happens in these cease fires if they aren't linked to as the Russians say uh a settlement of some sort that allows you to try to go back to normal look Ukraine has the biggest problem here they're the ones that are destroyed the Russians presumably will rebuild the donbas the area they have conquered but the ukrainians have all the rest you know they have an electric system that's basically shot they have to spend an enormous amount of money reconstituting their Electric System their Road system uh the the housing that has been destroyed and on and on and on plus they have lost millions of people a good number of them are never going to come back uh to Ukraine everybody knows that how are they going to handle all of that how are they going to reconstitute an economy between the war and the immigration of their people they don't have a functioning economy United States from what I understand has been paying the salaries of the military been paying the salaries of the civilian employees I mean all of that presumably is going to stop and I how they are going to do that strikes me as a bizarre unanswered question well when something is so bizarre the question is uh are things really the way they seem or uh can Trump really uh have been uh made such a vast uh miscalculation I think that that was my first reaction when I first heard about the proposal I thought doesn't he read the newspapers doesn't he read lavro speeches and Putin speeches where they they've spilled out exactly what they want what the red lines are uh and uh what is absolutely essential uh what about the elections who's going to be uh how can there be a a an agreement if there's no head of Ukraine legally empowered to sign anything it means that any agreement is legally and diplomatically meaningless uh what on Earth can be happening and uh the you you have to think somebody must have told Trump no uh uh of course it's not going to work and then when it doesn't work here's what we're going to do the question is what is this here's what we're going to do I think uh lavro in his speech U said a number of things uh he he said don't get too far ahead don't think that this is going to lead anywhere we're assuming that this is not going to lead anywhere uh and uh we're just going to continue doing what we've been doing all along it's been working for us uh and uh Putin Lov said national interests have to be guaranteed and uh how are you going to U guarantee them unless you don't get rid of the neonazis the uh regime and uh lavva said well we're going to have to have something like a war crimes trial a nurenberg and some people are going to be hanged and that's going to be uh probably not only uh zalinski but the as of Battalion people the neo-nazis the uh banderites who the United States uh put in charge of the national security agencies the army uh the police uh all of the thing the areas that Nazis go into to control uh a country now these are the people who know that if there is the kind of peace that Russia is insisting upon as a precondition either in a negotiated position or solving it on the battlefield that they're going to be out not only will they lose their jobs they may lose their Liberty uh and for some their lives for the most conspiratorial uh men responsible for bombing the civilian centers and creating war crimes and you can be sure that uh in lov's Long hour and a half discussion uh the the other day uh he made gave a whole list of the war crimes and the violations of all the agreements that uh the West has made via the uh the ne Nazis in uh uh in Ukraine you don't hear any discussion of that in anywhere in the American Press so somehow uh I think Trump has had to say what is going to happen when all this comes up the the the neo-nazis can't say okay we'll have peace on Russia's terms we'll just turn ourselves in to the Russian army and uh they'll put us under arrest and uh then incarcerate us uh it it it is inconceivable that any kind of agreement satisfactory to Russians and Ukraine not to mention uh Europe can be made during any kind of a ceasefire uh at all or in any way other than Russia's military victory in the War uh in Ukraine so that's where it's going uh uh it's going where I guess Putin could say although he's been too polite to say do give us a few months we we don't need to negotiate to do it we can achieve peace all by ourselves we'll just uh defeat Ukraine arrest the uh uh the enemy and uh remake uh the country and put our own uh put a uh government committed to peace uh in place with constitutional arrangements and uh the question of course is what's going to happen if england MI6 uh does the kind of thing that it's doing all along uh I could imagine Russia uh trying to get Trump to the following position saying look uh Trump you say you want peace okay it's going to be threatened by England if uh uh England brings in missiles to attack us there then uh this is going to be a fight between England and us not Ukraine and US Ukraine's just the vehicle for uh the uh British Russian war that goes way back to the Crimean war or the franor Russian war way back to the Napoleonic Wars uh we're going to settle it once and for all and that's uh so we want you to be clear uh America that if we bomb England or bomb uh military sites not civilian sites military sites in in France and uh elsewhere in Europe we're not going to bomb America uh you'll stay up of it and uh it'll between be between us and the uh uh the new right-wing uh emergence in Europe I maybe I shouldn't say right-wing because the right-wing is opposing the war the afd and the Malone Etc so you know that seems to be the dynamic that I can see H how would Trump have actually seen this and it could he have planned something like this all along that uh uh he'll make another seeming about faith and say okay it's in uh Russia's hands that's what all the newspapers they have the same quote it's on Russia's uh hands now uh and Don Trump will say okay that's Russia's hands uh uh let uh let the war resume Richard here is what lro said lro said in terms of the relationship between Russia and how Russia sees the relationship between there between between Russia and the United States here is what he said you want uh normal relations normal relations in the sense that the F foundation of the American foreign policy under the Trump Administration is National interest of the United States this is absolute and without any without any discussion but at the same time we understand that other countries also have their national interests and those countries who have their national interests and don't play into the hands of somebody's else interest right we are ready to have serious discussion it is very well understood they told us that countries like the United States and Russia would never have their National interest the same uh they would not coincide maybe even 50 or less per. but when they do coincide this situation if we are responsible politicians must be used to uh develop this simultaneous and similar interest into something practical which would be mutually beneficial be it economic projects infrastructural projects something else and then uh another message went but when the interest do not Co coincide and contradict each other again this is a then the responsible countries must do everything not to allow this contradiction to degenerate into confrontation especially military confrontation which would be disastrous for many other countries right yeah Richard your take on the way that he's picturing Russia and the way that Russia sees the West well it makes a lot of sense what he says to me and uh I'm impressed by his English I did not know it was uh as obviously accomplished and clear and that was a difficult set of ideas he had to get out there that that was that was very interesting to hear him say I was struck I don't want to belabor it I because I think Michael is right that there's much going on here that either the people involved haven't thought through and worked out or if they have they're not letting us see what that might be uh but I was struck one more thing an enormous part of what's going on here is a fight over land and who is is in charge of the land the Crimean Peninsula the whole donbas area the whole Eastern uh quarter let's say of the country of Ukraine given its complicated history with the Soviet Union beforehand and all of that and there wasn't a word if I understood correctly there was a negotiation that lasted 8 and a half hours so obviously covered a lot of material or was very contentious or both and yet the central issue that Russia would not tolerate anymore what they felt was going on namely the attack on Russians speaking and culturally Russian people in the Eastern quarter of the country blah blah I don't want to rehash all of that but Crimea plus Don not a word about that so that what that means that zalinski could imagine that we would have a ceas fire and on that basis he would claim as he has all along that they want all of that territory back they want to occupy the Crimean Peninsula they want to occupy the four um oasa regions of eastern Ukraine and the Russians that's why they went to war on that subject how could that it's not even mentioned and we're going to have negotiations I mean I find this very strange there would have to be some basis for the negotiation otherwise you will have in fact a ceasefire for 30 days and you're beginning from scratch my guess is they won't get very far with their negotiations since they haven't agreed on anything other than the Seas fire uh that that's a recipe for the Seas fire itself to not work to be a failure and 30 days from now you know uh to resume the war what possible benefit to anyone would that have achieved all will know is that the two sides are better organized better armed better equipped to resume the war a ceasefire is impossible for the following reason uh and it's not Crimea it's not the oblas it's uh Odessa uh Russia has already said we need to control the entire uh Coastline because that's where uh the Ukraine is being supplied by arms uh if they don't go through the Bosphorus uh and and if they don't go through let turkey letting them through then uh it has to be somehow uh Europe is sending arms through a Romanian port on the Black Sea and the Romanian a peaceful ship will get through the bosporus go to Romania get the arms for Odessa uh and apparently the British have been occupying Odessa uh for the last few months they've been solidifying defending Odessa that's what this is all about and uh Lov said uh in uh in the speech uh that Neiman has quoted he said uh number one uh condition Ukraine must withdraw from all Russian territory and cease military operations but uh it's not going to cease they're all we're dealing with a terrorist organization terrorists don't seek their operations they say okay it's not a military operation it's just a individual spontaneous terrorist operation and second ukrainians must have legitimate government to you know put in place and uh there's no way to have a legitimate government without having an election none of this can be done within a month so the very concept of a one- month uh ceasefire is uh impossible just for calendrical political and Military reasons uh and I I think uh in the and the whole big fight is going to come down to Russia's reconquest of Odessa uh and one of the points that Lov made was uh the United Nation UNESCO his uh designated Central Odessa as a world heritage site for cultural reasons uh and in the center of Odessa was the Statue of uh the the Russian queen that had uh founded uh o Odessa Katherine the Great the uh the ukrainians recently tore down the statue sold the metal for scrap and uh as uh Lov said there's not a squeak out of O out of uh the UN and UNESCO about any of this so the the Russians feel that there can't be any third so-called third party uh designated by the United States to oversee the ceasefire because the United Nations is agencies are hopelessly corrupt and uh levov gave a whole series of examples as to why and how the very the occe the arms control UNESCO one after another how uh the un uh agencies including the the current head of the un uh as a anti-russian uh ideologue uh uh is uh not an honest broker so how are they going to get honest Brokers I don't think the United States will let uh president Chi of of uh China uh be it there there's no ad way of even administering a a ceas fa so obviously uh Trump has all of this has to have been expected there's a breakdown we're going to see the breakdown tomorrow and uh there's I think everything will unfold and we will see whether this is an unfolding of a uh sort of orchestrated plan that's unfolding or it's going to be just Anarchy from the fact that Trump really is a uh one or the other by the way wiov is in Russia and right now we've learned that they're talking about that wiov is going to meet with Vladimir Putin yeah yeah he's they're going to discuss what has happened in the meeting between Americans and ukrainians but Shifting the Gear Richard to the stock market how do you see what are the main reasons of what's happening with the stock market okay um let me Begin by reminding everyone that the stock market is not the same thing thing as the economy and never was and you shouldn't read one off of the other they have their own sets of determinants that are not identical it is possible for the market to go up and the economy to be in trouble and it's possible for the economy to be in good shape and the market is in trouble so keep that in mind that's an important caveat because the short the short circuiting of that difference is common in the media they will infer one from the other you'll see presidential races in which one side says the economy is good why because the market is going up and the other side said the economy is terrible and that the market going up doesn't change that that's an awareness that they're different but it's being used in a crude way I want to make the case that you should keep it in mind because it is really the truth of this situation okay I'm going to mention three things quickly that I think contributed to the remarkable breakdown of the market on Monday and Tuesday of this week it's not yet clear where that's all going it's a bouncing around but the drop on Monday was unmistakable uh a thousand points on the on the measurement and so forth okay the first thing is to remind everyone that capitalism is a system of Cycles that's the politest word we have for this phenomena here are some other words bust crash crisis recession depression I could go on every four to seven years according to the National Bureau of economic research a well-respected agency of the US government on a my doesn't agree um between four and seven on average every four to seven years capitalism wherever it is has a downturn some of them are short and shallow others of them are long and deep the Great Depression of the 30s long and deep uh the the the collapse in 2020 very deep short the one in 2008 and nine deep and short uh well medium length in terms of how bad it can get so if you're using this four to sevene average and if the last one we had was in the year 2020 the so-called covid breakdown well it's five years so it's pretty much on schedule where are to make a long story short we're kind of doe for another one nobody should be surprised and if you read the financial press there are plenty of people who have done this little arithmetic and they know we kind of H we could be due for another one number two we have a very volatile uh Administration I mean on again off again trade war on again off again tariffs the latest one this morning a 200% tariff on European wine I believe it was uh you know this is a politician who has discovered that thanks to the Congress the Tariff is something he can do he can be a cowboy with the Tariff because he can he can declare them without having to go through any sort of procedure with any other branch of government he just has the power to do it and so he will by the way it's 50% tariff Richard just he he's talking about 50% tariffs on Whiskey and he's talking about you mentioned the Tariff on Europeans is going to be 200 yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah on Europe I thought I read the headline 200% that's right that's right Europe wine and I can you think of wine not yes yes yes I don't drink that in response by the way in response to 00 50% Tariff of of the on Whiskey coming from the States bbon yeah every Everybody the Chinese everybody is is tariffing bourbon in order to impact that part of the country uh which is concerned with bourbon production anyway here's the point the uncertainty and there's a story today's Wall Street Journal that the Business Roundtable has been having meetings with Trump and the lesson of all of it is clear this level of of on again off again produces what economists call uncertainty which is always a problem in economics and now it is an exaggerated uncertainty because of literally two months of on again off again no business in their right mind would move production from China to Ohio or from Mexico to New York based on this craziness because to move a production facility is very expensive and takes a lot of time in in short it entails risk and that risk would become crazy if you undertook the expense only to have a president like this undo the Tariff a month or a week or a year after you have undertaken this expense bottom line one of the reasons we may have a recession like one of the reasons for for last Monday's collapse is that people are calculating that the logical thing most big businesses will do in this situation is hesitate not invest postpone an in a planned investment and as we have learned ever since K's forced us to see it a capitalist economy is always held hostage by the investors if they in invest well then the circular flow of the economy works and we keep our jobs if they decide to hold back which their free enterprise allows them to do then we all suffer the consequences that they're not investing the money that the money is sitting there waiting Mr Trump maybe never will had that explained to him but he is increasing the uncertainty therefore the risk therefore the hesitancy and therefore the arrival of the next recession we're due for at any moment and what you saw on Monday was crystal clear an Exemplar of that why because the night before on a fox interview the question had the interviewer had asked Trump directly can you some words like can you rule out a recession this year and he he fudged he didn't give a clear answer he he clearly did not want to go and say oh don't worry it'll be taken care of he couldn't even give that if you put that together with what happened earlier last week and I believe we mentioned it last time in our conversation earlier last week the Atlanta Federal Reserve Bank issued its prediction for 2020 5 they said a recession is coming they predicted a decline of the GDP I believe in the neighborhood of 2% which would be not just a recession but a bad one wow so now there's in the air all of this add the uncertainty and you've got all the conditions and then finally I want to stick in here I know it's some special pleading here but I do believe that we are living in the de line of an Empire and that it it it is the background music no it doesn't explain the stock market on Tuesday or Monday no it doesn't but it is the back there is the Annoying worrisome backdrop in the minds of you know Jamie Diamond or anybody else in Wall Street that maybe we really are maybe what a few folks are saying I'll pick one in in their world Ray Dalo very important investor Bridgewater one of the biggest hedge funds in the world he's he keeps telling people that's what I see that's what I see even if you don't believe him it's in the air you put those things together and you can have a panic day on Wall Street like last Monday and you better pay attention because typically the crash doesn't all happen at once it shows you it smells already in advance and that's what I think Monday represents uhuh Richard well that's the whole point uh and that's why I don't believe in Cycles uh Cycles are ideological uh the National Bureau was founded by Wesley clart Mitchell who said uh uh capitalism uh is a cycle that goes on and on and on thanks to automatic stabilizers we don't need a government we don't need uh government regulation it's automatic the the free market is going to handle everything well you and I have spent our entire life talking about the long picture of where is capitalism going that's not a cycle all each cycle cyclical recovery in the United States has started from a higher and higher and higher level of debt the uh it's not simply that the Western Empire is going down the Western economies are going down because they've been so highly polarized uh the 90 90% of the population has not increased its part of GDP it's all been the upper 10% of the population and that's been polarizing uh gaining from the stock market as you pointed out that really isn't the economy the stock market is the economy for the 10% not the 90% so uh I I think there's an aware uh the problem goes much deeper than a cycle it's the fact that we're seeing the end of the whole post 1945 expansion of Western capitalism that was based on a uh uh unsustainable financialization debt increase uh increase in rent seeking leading to de-industrialization uh and as a result of this de-industrialization when you have Trump's Imports now which was the question that Nima asked you're going to have a break uh in supplies you've already seen uh the Ontario uh Governor Ford uh saying well we we're going to turn off the electricity to Upstate New York we're not going to just uh increase the price of uh Canadian electricity 25% we can just turn it off uh the the uh the tariffs that Trump want threatened to put on auto tra as we said uh prevent machine parts coming up there going to be all sorts of breaks in the supply chain that cause the whole chain to stop operating whole everything to stop and there's a feeling in all of the news reports that somehow what musk is doing by uh just uh uh cutting uh government activity uh apart by uh by creating chaos is going to create chaos that interrupts activity and uh it'll be just as you said Richard uh nobody's going to know going to try to invest in the United States without knowing exactly what they're going to do so how is EUR since we're talking about the West what's Europe doing well you have Merz in in Germany and uh lavro saying well we can we can uh have a re Revival of European capitalism uh by military spending uh 900 billion euros for military spending and uh maybe we can't produce cars anymore but Volkswagen and other companies can shift to military spending uh to U support the fantasy that Russia May invade us and we're going to need tanks to fight uh the Russian invasion well this can't really save capitalism because it's nonsense uh so I think there there's a a deeper fight here that uh you and I spoken about for years and years and years uh and it's what kind of world are we going to have uh and way back in the 1960s I can remember number discussions uh what kind of socialism is the world going to have is a final choice is it going to be the pr labor Social Democratic socialism that most of the world expected after World War II a kind of mixed economy uh such as has made China so successful or is it going to be the pro- financial national socialism that seemed to have Lost World War II but was uh somehow sustained by by the United States and uh rescuing uh the uh the Nazis and the banderites and bringing them to the US and Latin America and other uh countries to try to prepare for the final battle against against socialism uh and right now you're seeing the Trump Administration uh we didn't talk about this militarily but it's been promoting a worldwide right-wing uh movement to dismantle democratic government this and shift economic planning away from from government and elected representatives to financial Elites via the military Elites that are running the EU we talked about this uh last time on on Nima so I I think all of a sudden let's let's take what's happening in Ukraine and let's put it in this big uh economic political picture of uh uh what is going to be the fate of uh Western capitalism and it uh it looks desperate to me and if you look at all of this as a kind of desperate way of how can we somehow survive how can we get by at least to the next uh election campaign um short term as it is how can we solve the fact that the the West has uh e become economically self-destructive because of the economic forces that unive spent so many decades describing yeah I think what what I think would be worth our talking about both today and perhaps in a future show would be one key point that you made I think we need to examine why it is that you have the you Michael have the Judgment that Ukraine the war in Ukraine is linked to the notion that all of Europe is at at Peril from Russia which in turn is linked to an attempt to revive European capitalism which looks pretty sorry as it as it crumbles between the US on the one hand and the and the China bricks on the other that they're going to rescue all of that by a massive uh debt debt funded defense buildup I I think exploring that would not only be useful obviously to our European audience which I'm sure Nima knows is considerable but also to the rest of the world because even though Europe isn't the the colonial master of everything in the world that it once pretended to be it's still an important Block in the world economy the US the Chinese and then the Europe Europeans at least until others arrive I think that would be very very important because the effort led by Merz in Germany will be picked up by starmer and and Marron and the others because they're in the same kind of boat and they are going to have to stimulate and they're going to have to come up with the government they're going to have to come up with a rationale for doing that and given the weakness of the left it's more likely than not that they will do the merch although in France once macron is out of there it could go in a quite different direction I agree do you think Michael do you think the way that Donald Trump is dealing with Canada do you think that would lead to Canada just a ban what Donald Trump wants to do with them or we're going to see much more chaos in terms of the Tariff the this fight of some sort of tariffs putting on each other well the mentality of Canada is to submit and surrender to anything the United States does except the way in which Trump is uh set the antagonism with Canada makes it politically necessary to uh be self- assertive just as you're having Greenland self assertive uh it's as if Trump has tried to mobilize Canadian Nation ISM and give it a backbone uh that it has not had for over half a century so uh I think that Canada will uh try to retaliate because Canada uh has the ability to uh create a break in the chain of Supply in America uh most of America's steel uh 50% of America's steel comes from Canada uh 11% of America's aluminum comes from Canada uh uh and if uh Trump really imposes these crazy tariffs on steel and aluminum which are going to increase the price of every manufactured good made out of steel and aluminum and half of every car is made out of steel uh and put together uh with parts made across the Canadian or Mexican borders as we've discussed uh I don't see how the the car companies uh can uh continue to uh produce for a market and uh how other manufacturers are going to be able to uh function and Trump's fantasy is okay we've increased the price of importing aluminum and steel and autoart so highly that the only way that uh manufactured companies and car companies and uh air airplane companies can make a profit is to leave uh to relocate in the United States behind the Tariff wall uh Trump believes it'll probably take one week to build a new steel plant here uh the the 20 steel plants one week they're going to make new aluminum refineries that are made out of electricity I think you'll have to cut back half of America's uh home electricity consumption to make the aluminum but one week we can do it and the the recession will be over instantaneously this is crazy there's no uh saying okay here is the sequ in order if you want to industrialize America here are the things uh that have to happen you actually need a factory to produce industrial goods you have to build a factory that you have to get planning permission uh uh and you have to get a labor force that's going to uh do this some that somehow is trained you can't just send people into a steel factory and say okay here's the job you have to do it'll be like the people who go to work for the healthc care companies you call them and ask them a question and they say oh we just joined we really don't know what's happening uh it's it's Anarchy and uh the the Tariff situation is creating an anarchy that uh it's he he has a 20-year plan that has to work within two months that's not this is really crazy and this is uh this is the aspect of trump that's coming out not the long-term uh strategist how do I get rid of all my enemies in the uh uh neocon deep State uh no nothing meshes together let let me let me go at this in another way if you keep performing the way Mr Trump is with with the on again off again forget whether it gets worse and worse in terms of the higher and higher tariffs even the the uncertainty of whatever the level is on and off and on and off you are teaching the world a lesson in addition to what we've been talking about in terms of a declining Empire if the G7 now accounts for 28% of total output in the world but the Chinese and Bricks together account for 35% of the total output of the world which are roughly what the numbers are then you are training the world into re-evaluating their each country's situation who are we borrowing from who are we selling to who are we buying from because the very uncertainty of Mr Trump's behavior on top of the shifting Global wealth allocation means that countries need to do to make a long story short more business with China and the bricks and less business with the G7 because all anything else is stupid anything else puts you at a level of risk you you have no so you would rather be selling to the rising bricks configuration that so CH so Canada Canada produces electricity who needs electricity China and the bricks they're desperate for electricity sell it to them which they can do if you have steel and aluminum that the Americans are an uncertain market for sh sh and Michael is right that you don't shift everything all at once that's too expensive that's too risky but if everybody shifts 5% 10% of their business from one of these areas to the other the impact accumulated on the United States will be devastating but that's in the cards anyway take away Trump it's it it's been going on before trump it will continue after Trump trump it is subject to forces he cannot control and the effort to control what you cannot is often reflected in the kind of Herky jerky that you're seeing because he set himself an impossible task it's a little bit like Michael saying you know you can't have a two-month policy to achieve a five-year program this makes you crazy because you'll be so disappointed at what you get after two months that you instead of re-evaluating you can't do it you'll try some other policy hoping it will do in two months but that's not your problem the right policy your problem is you don't understand and we live in a country that we've talked about this now many times whose reaction to the declining Empire to the rise of the bricks is a combination of denial about what's going on and then the Fantastic imagination that if you send the seventh fleet to the South China Sea and you make a lot of noise about Taiwan you're going to slow or stop this process you're not you're not it hasn't worked for 20 years there's no reason to believe it's going to work now you can pivot to Asia all you want it's not a it's not a plan y yeah I think we can wrap it up right now and thank you so much Richard and Michael for being with us today great pleasure to talk with you same here see you soon see you soon bye-bye take care
