so nice to have [Music] you Michael and let's get started with a recent an article in Bloomberg it says that the United States is concerned about the strengthening ties between Russia China Iran and North Korea and Richard should they be concerned about this I think so yes they should be concerned whatever in the world that means is it the kind of speech you get from a a potentate who doesn't realize that he's not the potentate of anything anymore but has not wanted to face that and so talks in this peculiar language we are concerned what a are we all supposed to be children looking up to the great personage who's concerned I mean it's so foolish that it only makes the people who talk like this look ridiculous of course they're concerned half the reason that you see the alliance between Russia and China North Korea Iran and so on is because of act actions undertaken by the United States if they're concerned maybe they ought to wonder about their own contribution to this situation now what we get is we're concerned and that seems if you ask the question because they don't want you to they don't want to have to say it that seems to be connected maybe this concern to what they're doing in Ukraine or what they're doing now in the Middle East they are permitting you know the the the Chinese foreign minister either yesterday or the day before made it Crystal Clear we are on the side of the Arabs we are on the side of Lebanon and the Palestinians they are our brothers just so there would be no mistake about what he meant and why would you think the Chinese take a position on these questions that are tens you know thousands and thousands of miles away from them it's because they are very determined to be a reliable Ally and they have the clear sense that the United States is working itself into very dangerous dead ends in in Ukraine in one way and in the Middle East in another way they they are losing there's nothing much they can do they lose either way so for me the concern is just another silly way to imagine that anyone pays attention to you when you talk like this you think the Chinese are surprised to hear that the United States is concerned I mean it again it it it blows your mind at the this level I suppose it's intended to reinforce an American sense that we don't face the kinds of problems we do because it's not more than a matter of some concern look the United States is involved in Ukraine the and on the other side is Russia Russia is winning that that war Ukraine is losing that war the United States has agreed to escalate that war over and over again level of funding level of troops Abram tanks a16 fighter jets and now the question of the missiles into into Russia and so on every escalation Justified by enabling Ukraine to win and after every escalation Ukraine loses this is the truth it has nothing to do with concern they understand that they terribly badly underestimated Russia's power and I mean Russia's military power and I mean Russia's diplomatic power its alliances and even its economy the the Russians are now producing most of the Munitions they use and therefore they've been able to ramp up their economic uh Machinery even though they are infinitely smaller let me remind everyone Russia is A2 to3 trillion GDP on the other side of the War Western Europe and the United States together 30 to 40 trillion dollar you understand it's a 20 to1 ratio and yet the Russians are outproducing Munitions and everything else from their industrial economic base the Americans didn't get that the British didn't understand it their wonderful CIA and MI5 and all the rest of them didn't know or possibly the leaders in the United States in Western Europe didn't care or didn't listen it's quite clear now that the Pentagon doesn't want to expand to give the ukrainians anymore it's not just Mr Trump it's the Pentagon under Biden that is telling him don't do this and part of the reason reason is and I know this will upset people but I'm just telling you what I read I I have no privilege access to any information that anybody else couldn't get the Pentagon seems to believe that in a war now Russia is better prepared than the West wow this is David and Goliath and I hate to tell you but who's in which position Russians are David and we here are the the Goliath waiting to be knocked over with a slingshot this is an extraordinary situation it is so far beyond the word concern that it is downright ridiculous to talk like that unless there's somebody you think you can continue excuse me to fool with that kind of language and I really think that number is shrinking too yeah Michael well you said that uh the United States was not only concerned but alarmed and uh these statements are almost a comic parody of how blind the United States and its diplomats have been uh by their own neoliberal policies they've created a sense of urgency for other countries to band together to protect themselves from the US actions that are aimed at preventing them from acting them in their own self-interest uh as Benjamin Franklin said if we don't hang together you'll hang separately so of course uh Russia China and Iran have uh joined together as part of the Shanghai cooperation organization what's so laughable is the US blind spot in not expecting other countries to fight back and uh uh create an alternative to the plans that the United States have it's as if the United States thinks we can act and other countries won't respond they have no choice but to do what we've said after all we've tried to put in place uh our own proxies uh is their leaders just like uh we we've done in Europe uh we can treat other countries like we treated Iraq we could just uh March in militarily no resistance at all we can do whatever we want economically uh they can uh go to Europe and they can uh blow up North Street pipeline uh and essentially block the European industrial recovery and Europe will go along with it won't do anything along at all so that's what makes the United States not only concerned but actually surprised that this is happening they did not take into account the idea that other countries will react and that they uh will react in their own self-interest and from from the US point of view they can say well what selfin interest after all uh can they have they haven't really uh shown anything yet just like Russia hasn't yet really fought back against NATO uh the the other countries uh together uh haven't created a Al alternative to the US diplomacy and uh what they realize reacting to the US diplomacy isn't simply about the recent new Cold War uh attacks it's not simply about Ukraine uh or about Israel it's about uh the whole uh system that the United States set up after World War II to control the world to the IMF and the World Bank so what we're really seeing is the flowering of uh the drive for Independence that started with the bandong conference in Indonesia 70 years ago uh that their aim has remained constant to protect their self-interest from being victimized by the world World in which the US diplomacy created in 1945 then created again in 1971 when it went off gold and then in 1991 after the decl fall of the Soviet Union uh the uh a whole new world has been created basically under us Direction and for the first time now other countries are seeing the need to pre uh create their own alternative and to become independent and the United States is just is unprepared for them acting economically and politically uh to join together as it was unprepared uh for other countries actually to fight back and to actually be stronger well uh What U what Richard has just described in the military sense of it turns out militarily uh the US Army itself has said Russia's stronger economically the global majority stronger led by China Russia and uh Iran uh as the basic core for all of this so uh the United States has started a war uh thinking that uh it was Goliath thinking that anything it could do other countries uh would only react uh passively and accept whatever the US is doing all of a sudden that shortsightedness uh of economic planners and Military planners uh has uh uh shown that the United States never thought of a plan B and the plan B might include other countries acting on their own behalf and that's what we're seeing right now they're being driven to do this by the US economic and financial and Military aggression they see themselves being essentially threatened uh just as uh they're threatened by being turned into what's happened in Germany uh in Europe uh what's happened in Gaza uh and Lebanon they don't want that fate to uh be them and now for the first time they're acting together yeah I can you let me add just another example o of this I am struck and I started looking over the last week in the financial press uh how it reacts because if you've paid attention you will know that over the last week or two uh the candidate the Republican candidate Donald Trump Trump has talked a great deal about tariffs raising tariffs against Mexico particularly there was a lot of discussion against the John Deere Corporation itself an American producer of agricultural equipment and so on raising tariffs against Europeans and just on and on here's what I want to point out not only does he feel comfortable in doing that but in in another way the way the reports go and I'm talking about the Wall Street Journal and and financial uh reporting they report what he says they go into it but they either don't say a word or buried in the ninth paragraph of an article there is a remark about how there's also a question of quote unquote ret alation I mean that's what Michael is talking about what is this way of thinking and again it's not just Mr Trump but the editors and the reporters who write about all of this what do you what there may be retaliation of course there'll be retaliation we've already seen retaliation during the presidency of Mr Trump and Mr Biden since there have been retaliations there been guarantees of retaliations you know we even saw a headline earlier this week that the Calvin Klein fashion house is going to be investigated in China etc etc and it's it's Crystal Clear that this is in part A retaliation against these China targeted tariffs and there's a look I don't want to be poetic but but the poem suggests itself in the act of what we call containing or isolating China what is actually happening occurring as if we weren't aware is the isolation of the United States we are giving the rest of the world every incentive not to rely on the US market not to rely on financing from the US the the US is an unstable unreliable partner in economic transactions of various kinds that's a serious situation and I think it it goes to what what Michael was saying you can't you can't do this as if every time you act everybody will play the role you would like them to play play in response that's not retaliation that's collapse one final example back in the 1970s when the United States began to face the fact that Germany and Japan had recovered from the war had repaired their War destroyed Industries and had developed new industries that were geared to outc competing the United States and they had achieved it and suddenly American roads were filled with Japanese Automobiles and the United States said this has to stop well the Japanese caved in they agreed to quotas for some years the United States had a quarter you can bring so many Japanese made cars here that's it a quota acts like a tariff it blocks the difference is it doesn't affect the immediate price it just means after a certain number you go to the dealer for the Toyota you don't get a Toyota because there aren't any Toyotas you've run out of your allowance for that year and when that didn't work the United States gave another dictate you can produce your car but it has to be done here you can't bring it in and the Japanese what were they going to do first of all the United States was such an overwhelmingly important Market they were very they could not afford not to make it for the American Market we are a much smaller part of the World Market today than we were then we don't play that kind of role number one number two they had nowhere else to turn now they do and this is true for every country the world has changed and you're not going to get the collapse of the people negatively impacted by American Economic Policy you're just not going to get it and I don't think that has sunk in any more than that you can't dictate what happens in the Middle East and you can't dictate what happens in Ukraine it hasn't sunk in they just don't get it they don't want to see it they can't afford to see it it's politically unpopular because you have not prepared your people to understand what's going on when I talk in this country about the declining Empire I can you know I'm a teacher I watch my audience I can see the difficulty that this very idea occasions in their minds and I I've learned you know I studied enough British literature to know that the cl the British Empire was very difficult for the British Michael it seems that your mic is not on turn it on yeah okay how is this yeah yes yeah it's working right now Michael the point is here in in the in the article in Bloomberg it says that because of sanctions these countries are getting together but what would be the policy do you see any sort of change in the policy of the United States in order to change in order to address what they're talking about well if it changed its diplomacy it wouldn't be the United States uh I mean it's very difficult for it to be something uh that it's not uh the neocons are completely in control and they uh they in in order to rise within the bureaucracy here you have to accept all of the assumptions that the United States is making and we've just been describing these assumptions that other countries won't react that the United States can do everything the United States wants uh essentially to do what uh the World Bank and the IMF does it wants other countries uh to be forced into debt by following trade policies uh that rely on the United States it Force once they're in debt it wants them to privatize and sell off their uh public uh infrastructure their natural resources their land and everything and it wants uh the US uh or its Allied purchasers to take the uh economic rents and in uh profits from these companies and remit them to the United States in other words the United States plan since 1945 has been to create an international dependency uh and how can you expect a country that's had that to uh suddenly relinquish it and said all right we're just going to give up and be like everyone else well if any Congressman would say that and say anything but we're America first we can do everything that Congressman would be voted right out of power so the first thing the United States has had to do is make sure that uh we don't have a parliamentary system like Europe we can't have a third party we can only have an duopoly of the Republicans and Democrats where the uh the uh politicians who are elected are all saying the same thing we're number one and if you question this you're being unpatriotic and if you say that you're against the war in uh in Ukraine uh then you're you're supporting Putin uh and if you uh say that there's uh you're against the war against the West Bank and Lebanon and Gaza then uh you're anti-semitic and uh the as long as that's controlling us politics uh there I don't see the chance uh of anything happening so what can what happens in such a situation uh the the decline and sort of the destruction of a world leader always happens from within and within now mean the United States has created a greater the United States sort of like a a greater Israel Over the whole near East or the Soviet Union over over the whole of central uh Europe the United States has absorbed Europe uh into uh its whole Cold War policy and uh you have uh England uh being even more Pro us than the us because that's how you get us support to end up in the position that Mr starmer is in for instance or Von Delan uh in the European Union so uh I think what's spooking Europe right now uh is the fault that uh the thought that uh they may have to be called on to support the US by uh sanctioning not only Russia but now they have to sanction China uh and incl uh any of the global majority allies that the United States has anyone but the United States so the United States is sort of breaking up its uh uh its self-interest uh not only with uh Europe which has uh been the core core of the US forign orbit but in the United States uh itself the uh the the American economy especially the computer sector uh has is uh heavily dependent uh on China uh if there are sanctions on uh on uh Imports in China then uh that all of a sudden is going to price uh the United States out of the World Market how how what how you're seeing you're seeing Intel already going under uh and you're seeing American industry be protesting and saying wait a minute we need Chinese gallium and germanium and Cobalt and all sorts of rare Earths uh that we can't get away with so all of a sudden the you have the economic strains conflicting with the political strains well uh I'm sure Richard and I all believe both believe in uh historical materialism we we we expect countries to act ultimately in their economic self-interest and what the United States is doing is not acting in its economic self-interest but the Pol political sort of uh infantile narcissism of the neocons we can do anything and if you don't do anything we'll hurt you uh or throw a temper tantrum and do something you won't like uh so what we're really seeing is within the United States itself a conflict between the neocon dreams of control and the uh domestic economy of the US and its European satellites uh saying wait a minute your a uh your dream uh is not realistic your fantasy is destroying our reality of the uh e economic Prosperity that you are supposed to promote uh and also e economic freedom you you and the United States have had you you forced us to suspend economic freedom when there is the three elections in Germany uh with the U the German parties opposing the war in Ukraine the alternative for deuts land uh the the European response at us direction is Ban the party you cannot have a democracy where you let people vote against us interests uh you have to ban Russian opera singers from singing you have to ban RT you cannot have a democracy if you have free speech that uh uh says that what we're living in is a fantasy world not a reality world so you're you're you're redefining democracy itself to be uh any country that follows the US demands for uh World control has nothing to do with free it means abandoning Free Speech it means abandoning uh the First Amendment it means abandoning uh open uh contacts it means abandoning free trade to deal with countries that the United States are against uh United States dreams are forcing a radical uh reversal of everything that the United States said was the root of Western Civilization so what we're seeing today is that America is attacking the concept of Western civilization and civilization itself in what it's doing in the Ukraine in the near East you know there's a there's a historical echo in in what Michael just said that that might be worth keeping in mind after World War II the business community of the United States collectively acted in horror at what had happened during the Great Depression and in the war I want to remind everyone uh a Social Democrat a politician like Franklin Roosevelt a accomodated to a Revolt From Below led by the CIO the the union organization and embedded by strong socialist and communist parties here in the United States and they acted together led by the head of the Mind Workers Union johnel Lewis and they made big changes that's why we have social security unemployment compensation the first minimum wage and government jobs by the millions all of those things were achieved in the depths of the depression when quote unquote there was no money oh it turned out there was and then a war was fought during which the United States allied with the Soviet Union post offices in the United States had pictures over the clerk's window where you went to buy your stamps and there you'd see a a cartoon Uncle Sam arm in-arm with Uncle Joe and that Uncle Joe was Joseph Stalin for those of you who don't know or don't remember or don't want to know your own history and at the end of that 10 years of depression five years of war the business Community was horrified by where politics in America was going and they mounted a crusade I chose the word carefully to undo the New Deal to undo the political Alliance that had made it possible Socialist Communist parties allied with labor unions the second half of the 20th century was the systematic destruction first of the Communist party then of the two socialist parties and then of the labor movement which went from representing almost 40% of the labor force to representing today somewhere around 10 a catastrophic decline running the entire period we have to understand that the slogan of the time was you cannot question anything about capitalism because if you do you're a communist and therefore you're a stalinist and therefore you're an agent of a foreign power Stalin is gone on the Communist party is a shell of what it was in Russia Putin is a strong anti-communist pro-russian Orthodox Church leader but it doesn't matter because all of this comes out of the American situation we need another Stalin and if there isn't one there we'll make Putin into his understudy that's it we need that but here's the rub of all of it you can't keep doing that that's the so-called crywolf problem you keep doing that and it's less and less you can already see that here in the United States they can't do at least they haven't been able so far what they did then maybe they'll be able to maybe I'll be shown wrong that you can have another Purge of the sort we associate with the name of Senator Joe McCarthy maybe Mr Vance or someone like that will play that role for us but I can assure you the world even if the US can run that game again the rest of the world will not sit quietly by it's not what it was in the 1940s 50s and 60s destroyed beyond words having to focus its entire energies on rebuilding from World War II we're not in that situation those countries are in very different places and it's a luxury we cannot afford so I don't think it's an option and that's that's why I keep saying we are a declining Empire and we're only making that situation worse by pretending it isn't happening Michael do you want to add something H well he's he's essentially filled out what I was saying before uh he's quite right uh when I was uh a teenager in the 1950s my socialist friends uh uh and most of my friends were socialists uh said that World War II wasn't simply a fight between the United States and Germany it was a fight over what kind of socialism the world was going to have after World War II was it going to be national socialism or Nazism or the kind of socialism that we talked about that had developed ever since the 19th century and of course we all hoped that uh capitalism itself would find it self-interest into evolving into uh more and more socialism the government would play uh a rising role uh continuing what Roosevelt had done with a new deal into more and more socialist uh Social Democratic policies and that seemed to be the case here uh in the British labor party uh and in in other countries at least those that uh uh were not run by us back dictatorships uh and but what turned out is that we what we didn't know at the time was all of the US uh appropriation of uh uh the ex-nazis in Operation Paperclip uh to use them as a in the United States to to fight communism as Richard has said and the the attempt to sort of plan there's still going to be an attack on Russia we have to bide our time uh and what's developed is that the United States is uh literally backing a Nazi uh country in uh Ukraine that is quite openly uh The Reincarnation of the German Vermont uh with the same Insignia um and the same Heroes uh that worked with the verat in World War I same thing in the near East it's backing a philosophy of uh ethnic hatred towards people who are uh not your uh ethnicity uh all all of this is a in many ways a replay of the fight that occurred at the end of World War I but with the United States uh not taking the side that uh we seem to believe it was taking at the time yeah and what what's so amazing right now that Emanuel macron recently said that we have to think of the conflict in Ukraine we have right after this conflict we have to have some sort of relationship between Europe and Russia but with the current phase of the conflict and the way that the European Union is behaving right now do you see any sort of policy on their part to consider the relationship in the aftermath of the conflict in Ukraine well here's what's so unique that uh the uh when you say Europe you're if you're you're referring to the European Commission of V Delan and the uh the right-wing cold Warriors that she's uh appointed uh this is not what the European population has voted for uh the European population in France the French population didn't vote for macron but macron is in power uh they didn't vote for the uh Christian Democrat uh leader Schulz in Germany but uh uh he's in power the uh the two American presidential candidates are both uh pressing for uh to extend the cold war in Ukraine uh and in Israel and yet the American voters say they don't want to support uh the war so you uh you have a uh a disconnect between the political leadership and the Democracy the voters can advise and consent that's about it but there's they don't have any enforcement just like the United Nations when it says there should be peace and you have in Gaza you have to let the health providers uh through to uh give food and Medical Care uh to the victims uh of of Gaza uh Israel won't let them through it it blocks it it look it insists in looking through just delaying uh the Trump trucks holding huge back back uh log the United Nations doesn't have a military force to uh enforce um what its members uh believe so what's the result going to be uh will it it it looks like there'll have to be uh at first a shadow United Nations and then altogether uh new United Nations uh without uh the the current members of the security Council uh without without NATO members being part of this new United Nations and uh what how will what will happen in the United States with the uh the the censorship uh uh in in college campuses now you're not allowed to say you're for peace in the near East that's uh well students have been uh expelled uh for saying that professors have been expelled for saying that we're seeing uh we're seeing an inherent instability that can only result in the kind of Crisis and in a crisis you never really know uh which way things are going to go but it looks like uh the uh Global majority is going to go in a different and I hope more positive direction than the United States looks like it's going in as the political control mechanisms have taken control of uh the the neocom basically have ceased control and uh de democratized the United States just as uh the European commission uh and the Euro uh commission has de democratized Europe yeah I I would add you know Mr mcon you in the last general election there were two rounds in the first round the French people had an option to vote for you know half a dozen or more parties that participate uh in French elections and there were three main parties one a unified left party one the far right uh National front party and then Mr Marron and he had the great distinction of being a sitting president whose party came in three third out of three he's the dead political animal number one and so the fact that he supports Ukraine tells you something Michael is quite right if you add together the left-wing vote and let me remind those who may not know the new left-wing party the uh the popular front the new popular front it called is a combination of the French Communist Party the French Socialist Party the french green party and and the largest of them all which is called France unbowed the party of Jean luk milon who's the leader that party is the largest vote getter in France they came in first they have more deputies in the parliament than anybody else coming in second and not close either coming in second was the right-wing nationalist party and then Mr mron came in a distant pathetic third and you know what he's associated with Ukraine now it's hard to say he has this or that policy because he changes policy with his underwear it changes all the time he he was a person who said we have to come to terms with Russia early on a year later he was was in the Forefront of the European countries wanting to send troops to join the ukrainians now he's back toward the I mean maybe that's not surprising for a dead polit a politically dead politician but it doesn't make his death any less real then there were the three elections in Eastern Germany who had very much the same kind of result the far right revived in Germany which should scare people anyway and the new far-left SAR vagen KES coming out of nowhere with a new party barely a couple years old but able to articulate a far leftwing position her background is Marxist and so on uh these these are very powerful straws in the Wind [Music] Italy was the the Italian leader is ambivalent the Czech leader is is that your is that noise with you no he's not here I don't know it's coming from you or Michael well I I think that what uh you just been describing uh explains President Putin's monetary strategy uh in Ukraine right now uh people are asking why uh why doesn't Russia uh respond more uh the United States is trying to uh doing everything it can to uh resort to terrorist uh attacks within Russ on Russian cities on Russian uh nuclear [Music] U electronic electric generators uh hoping that it will make it respond so the United States can then go Kaboom uh against it Iran or any of its supporters uh Putin hasn't done any he's going very very slow and people are saying why doesn't he just move faster and there's the United States is trying to encourage political pressure with discontent within Russia itself to saying why doesn't he fight back uh well I think Putin recognizes exactly what you've been saying Richard he realizes that time is on his side he sees these strains that you just described politically tearing Europe apart and uh he sees that time is not on the side of the US neon control over uh over uh Europe that every uh uh few months now uh we're in a fast moving crisis and there's this Consciousness that uh there has to be an alternative to what's happening and uh essentially Europe is uh being uh wrecked economically uh the the industry is going down the balance of payments is going down there's a hesitancy of other countries to uh hold Euros anymore because they can't see how uh the euro exchange rate can be supported by German industrial exports that are in the past uh German companies are moving uh out out of Germany there's unemployment so I think that uh Putin realizes that as long as he can just do nothing let the uh you the NATO countries uh America on the one hand Europe on the other let them both uh self-destruct as they polarize and uh obviously this inter this uh uh the us only response is to say how are we going to stop other countries from breaking away from the US control and uh we started the program by saying uh this uh this us response of trying to uh control them by threats by uh uh military actions by sanctions has had just the opposite effect of what was intended uh but the effect has created been to create a sense of urgency uh that is driving other countries out of uh the US orbit and that means not only out of using the US dollar uh is uh since uh Europe uh has grabbed uh the Russian uh foreign exchange reserves that it had there but to create an alternative ative to the whole us centered World Order um and that was designed to create unipolar control by the United States through uh the World Bank uh control uh the IMF control over privatization and most of all the control of all of the foreign dollar debt uh that's owed by uh the global South and the global majority uh to sort of com compel payments that uh essentially will achieve by financial terms what used to be achieved only by military uh terms so uh I think there's there's a recognition on other countries let just let's just let uh these strains develop uh at some point and President Putin said it may it'll probably take 30 years uh for Europe to assert its independence from the United States once the United States finds itself isolated from uh the rest of the world um well it's up to it's a business Community you can say up to the dynamic of its industry the whole laws of motion of the American economy are being threatened by this self-isolation this uh ending of uh the American uh attempt to dominate others by free trade and instead by protectionism that simply raises the cost of doing business and living in the United States to price the United States even more out of the World Market there's no analysis that these policies are destroying the United State's economy from within because uh to understand that you would have to change the whole uh agenda of mainstream economics as it's taught in the universities uh that's why you and I talked at univers taught at universities that were not in the mainstream uh and had a different view it's a really what we're facing is not only a clash of power it's a A Clash Of Consciousness uh and in that sense we're in a really civilizational chain right now could I if if I have a couple minutes here I want to add a footnote to what Michael said in that 30 years that Putin referred to how long it might take for all this to play out I want people to be more aware than they may have may be that right below the surface and now it's increasingly coming to the surface that there is enormous momentum in Europe to let's put it this way accelerate the process the premise and I think we've talked about this at least briefly before the premise is the anxiety among many components of European society that they do not want to go down with the United States they see a good part of what we've been talking about they worry that they that their leaders used to 75 years of uh um being uh under the wing of the United States I'll you I'll leave it at that that those leaders are committed they they've made their bed they're lying in their bed they are the people for whom the Atlantic Alliance is the beginning an end of how far they can see many of them have been educated in the United States many of them have been indoctrinated in a in a world where the United States defined most of everything but right below them are the people who are living the reality that Europe is is declining the center of technological innovation is either the United States or China there's nothing going on in Europe that indicates that that's going to change any times they may have this or that but basically are not able and yet they are a richer if you just use the money equivalent they're a richer block than the United States they have more people than the United States if you unify the rest of Europe all of it it's even more the case well so in terms of where Britain might end up etc etc so there's going to be there already is there's going to be in my judgment growing pressure inside Europe not not to make the commitment to the United States anything like what it has been to try to play a role in between to somehow say enough no to the United States and enough yes to China to give them some sort of balancing operation economicly and you can see small signs of it that aren't so small once you think about them I'm going to give you one Mr Biden accompanied by Mr Trudeau and that should tell you something has a 100% tariff against Chinese electric vehicles so if a CH if you produce a an electric car or an electric truck in China and you try to bring it into the United States or Canada whatever the price is let's say $30,000 you will have to give an equal $30,000 to either the government of the United States for the Tariff here or the government of Canada for the Tariff there thereby doubling the price making the cars unaffordable in Europe the taxes about 15 20% threaten to go up to 35% next week and there are intense negotia but even before we get to how those negotiations might play out out notice the difference if you go on the roads of Europe you'll see lots of electric cars and about a quarter of them are Chinese they're coming in and the Europeans Grumble and they but they're not gonna do what the United States did this is very bad for the United States why because the United States competes with Europe probably more than anywhere else it means All European competitors will be able to purchase TR cars and trucks best quality lowest price from China whereas their American competitors excluded from doing that will have to pay 40 to 50,000 for a inferior American electric car and that's going to play out in their pricing policies because that's a major input this is very dangerous you don't talk about it but it doesn't mean it isn't happening and the Europeans are very clear they don't want to be left out of this process they're going to outcompete the United States in the third world because their input price for electric vehicles is a fraction of what it is in the United States this is very serious stuff and the United States doesn't talk about it but that doesn't mean it isn't there and having the impact so it's clear to me that the Europeans are already struggling my guess is that there were pro- Americans who wanted 100% tariff on electric Chinese vehicles but the European opposition to that prevailed and they had to have a compromise at 30% or 20% but that's what I'm arguing I think that's going to be more and more and more of that and it's then going to blow up and if Mr Trump becomes president and if he levies the taxes and sanctions on the Europeans he has said he will well then this process will be accelerated and before anybody doubts me the sanctions against Russia not only failed to stop Russia in the war in Ukraine it also accelerated the very premise with which this program began the coming together of China Russia uh Iran and North Korea so these things can be accelerated by policy decisions that don't understand what they're feeding into yeah well that's that's what piran tried to do in Argentina in the 1950s or 40s and 50s and we all know what happened to Argentina uh other countries have tried uh the same Chile tried the same thing we know what's happened to it Libya tried to do the same thing we know what happened to it so uh this uh this other countries seeking to work in their self-interest may not be a pretty sight yeah yeah and it seems that bricks is going to come up with a new system of communication economic communication Richard how do you find do you think that the way that sanctions are working right now how much the main power of these sanctions come from just the everybody is the international relationship in terms of their economy is based on us the United States dollar how about that if they come with a new solution for economic communication how would that affect the sanctions well let me take a step back I know perhaps Michael and I don't agree on this one uh I I think sanctions are 90% empty in other words my my impression I'm I'm not a sleuth I'm not a policeman you know I can't quote you the very nature of what a sanction is and what the evasion mechanisms are means that you're not going to get statistics on it that are worth very much but here's my impression that most of them are a a nuisance and an expense but they are not a make or break of hardly anything the more serious they are the more elaborate the schemes to evade or hide or maneuver them the easiest way to understand this is if you have a sanction you cannot accept Russian oil okay so then the Russians send it first to mosambi then they offload it on one from one freighter to another and it arrives in London from mosambi where there are no sanctions in effect right what are you going to do inspect every cargo well there AR R if you want you can do that then there are ways to get around that also in fact every mechan it's a little bit like you know all the clever mechanisms of police departments do we still have the crimes yes are the police able to prevent them no your best hope is that they reduce it somewhat and the but the truth of it is the rest of the culture is at least as important in controlling crime as anything the police ever do we have in in the United States the best example we have more people in jail than anybody we have more police than anybody per capita and we have more crime than anybody per capita and we've had all of them together for a long time okay so I don't think sanctions make a big difference but they do add inconvenience and expense and that's a serious problem and and that's why you will find more and more examples of countries looking for ways to disengage from the United States because it is toxic in this way they don't want these sanctions they don't want the expenses of these sanctions absolutely they don't they go to considerable lengths but they are not going to abort their own economic strategy to evade a ition you don't need to do that to evade a sanction they know that there are many companies in the world and by the way the American government knows everything I'm saying to you no I have no again I have no special knowledge of anything but there are companies around the world who specialize in evading us sanctions and anybody who needs to do trade with the United States who who's worried about sanctions works with those companies and uses their services and pays for them to evade the sanction it's an extra expense it is dealt with by businesses in the same way that they deal with the rise and fall of the oil price or the rise and fall of freight rates on international shipping and so forth these are the problems of doing business but instead of them being generalized in a market they're all concentrated in the United States because no one else does this this kind of sanctioning is done by the remember I gave you the statistic in an earlier program I'll do it again Wall Street Journal had an article it was wonderful to read the United States they counted them 15,000 sanctions against countries industry and even individual business persons and firms that's the number one country in the world the number two country is Switzerland and then the number three country so far down the list I can say to you barring the weird Switzerland which I assume has something to do with their Bank secrecy uh rules that's why they have S otherwise who cares that Switzerland puts a sanction on you right so the United States is effectively in terms of the World Trade the sanctioning country okay so that's an incentive for every country on Earth to limit it its dependence on the United States and that's not good for the United States not good for its exports not good for its Imports nothing it may be wonderful for politicians to use for votes and it may work that the editorial writers in the newspaper do not expose the absurdity of what is being done here but then we go back to what Michael said that this is a narcissism of an Empire that cannot see the writing on the wall even as the walls close in on it well of course I agree with what Richard's been saying uh we've both been talking about how s don't work uh I'm concerned with something much more than sanctions and that is uh what are what remains of the international rules of World Trade and investment and uh the whole overhang of US dollar debt uh sanctions don't work but uh for other countries to assert their independence from the United States they need to be independent from the IMF and World Bank by creating their own International financial institution to ordinate their own uh relations their own uh trade laws they have to get rid of the International Investment private investment Court uh that says that countries will be have to pay damages if they uh f a oil company for creating a environmental disaster uh and try to make the oil company pay uh the uh government can be sued and have to give back uh maybe with damages everything that it's find find uh that it's tried to uh regulate uh oil companies against creating disasters uh this is these laws are travesties and yet they're part of the institutional framework that the United States has put in power just so its oil companies can pollute the whole world and not pay a penny and make the governments go bankrupt if they try to have the tarity to assert their own power as a national state uh to F Define uh these countries uh the there's uh under the current rules of the uh the context that all countries have to operate in there's uh is a set of rules that are pro creditor proinvest and against the na the uh National self-reliance and the power of states to tax to regulate to declare war to do anything independently uh of uh these rules and that's uh uh the whole system has to be replaced not simply there not simply a fight against the US neocon narcissists and control it's a fight it's a civilizational fight against the way in which uh these neocon narcissists and neoliberal uh narcissists have created a dysfunctional world order yeah and there you can see right there you can see the appeal of the bricks and the appeal of China and and and the writing is on the wall if the deal that you get from the IMF or the World Bank or the United States or Britain have the quality that Michael has just summarized and there's tons of literature that go into this they now have an option if nothing else they haven't they can put together a trade delegation of five important people and send them to New Delhi or send them to Beijing or send them to sa Paulo and work out an alternative this is an amazing thing we haven't had that for a long time we've had a pretty harsh unified Global Capital Market for borrowing countries they can now play you know the west and the East against each other it's a whole new ball game and they're all learning now what it might do for them and if they can develop which they're busy doing parallel multinational institutions parallel to the IMF parallel to the World Bank and so forth and so on along with a new current International currency or basket of currencies or whatever these are all steps they won't change everything overnight the dollar doesn't disappear but it shrinks in its importance and that's pretty Relentless and has already gone further than anybody has if you look at it you you can't but argue it's underway what we're talking about it's not we're not talking about the future we're talking about what's going on now and even if Michael and I sound like we're harbingers of scary Futures we're not we're in the odd position of having to explain as if it were new something that isn't new at all has been going on for quite some time now is already well underway it's just that you the people were you direct this video to are probably living in an environment that understates what's going on kind of radically I mean look at the the election we talked about in France I follow closely my my father was born in France I speak French I read French blah blah blah I follow the events in France I live in New York City I live in the United States I'm an American citizen and all that and I would read here unbelievable in the United States the race in France was between the great leader macron and the extreme rightwing Challenge of Marina Leen when I have to explain to people you know just a second excuse me the number one political party is neither of those they look at me black they have no idea and this is not because these people are ignorant or don't care they are not ignorant they do care but the entire framing of that issue leaves Mr M as the great president and the and by the way he gets credit I this blew my mind he gets credit for defeating the rightwing that's how that's how it was played in this country well you multiply that by every other country and multiply that for decades and then you understand why it sounds strange to hear Michael and I talk about an American public and an American government that lives in another world they created this other world because the one they'd live in was terrifying to them which I understand but that is the reality ity and my guess is is an accumulating awareness that this is very very dangerous Michael do you want to add something no I think uh We've pretty much covered it okay thank you so much for being with us today Richard and Michael great pleasure as always okay and my best wishes to Michael that he can sort out that camera problem so we can see him head on rather than side saddle if we can talk later after show show Nea I'll try to experiment all right yeah good good okay folks
