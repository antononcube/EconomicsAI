hi everybody today's Thursday December 12th and our friends Michael Hudson and Richard Wolff are back with us welcome back good to be here thank you very much Nima glad to be here let's get started with the situation that you're witnessing right now in Syria when you look at the conflict in Syria and and what has happened to the Middle East in your opinion what is the bigger picture of what's going on and let's start with Michael well the bigger picture is that this is as you say it's much bigger than Syria uh the United States uh says we are at ending up with total war with Russia and with China uh Russia uh is uh saying we hope that peace in the near East China saying we want peace we don't want war this I don't understand why they're saying this why don't they say we realize that this is a war to the death uh Russia talks about a proportional response uh certainly in in in Ukraine for instance uh so if there's just a an attack and bomb uh it will have a proportional response but what's the real proportion at work the proportion is the total the Cold War we want to control uh every the whole world we want to break up Russia into dep Parts you want to break up China into parts and we're going to make uh step after step after step uh until there's a response and the fact is the Americans uh if you're General you never know how far you can push until somebody else pushes back and there really hasn't been any push back and if you're told uh by Russia that there is a proportional response than uh you uh Russia and the Americans and NATO can do whatever they want step up and step up and know that there will only be a response to the the local tactic not to the overall strategy I don't see any strategy on the on the part of NATO well your question is about Syria and obviously the whole uh country is now in motion there really isn't any Syria anymore much as there probably won't be a Ukraine anymore uh you see Israel uh taking uh the Western Syria uh you see turkey taking the Kurdish areas and what it can and the Americans saying well we're taking all the oil to give to Israel uh is our agreement uh you have the leaders of the uh the Isis uh Al-Qaeda group wearing t-shirts made by mosad uh apparently people have seen that so uh there this is completely cut off Lebanon and uh from support uh by uh Iran I don't know what Iran is thinking probably Saudi Arabia is thinking well they're really trying to grab the whole near East maybe we should be very careful about joining bricks and threatening uh to move our assets out of the dollar uh because we could be next America's turned on one so-called Ally after another you know starting with Saddam Hussein who was put in by the CIA originally uh just all the way e all the way rest it looks like the the US plan to take over all of the near East and it's soil uh is is working using Israel as its battering ram uh for that Israel will get the land America will get the oil and control of that and that's sort of the it looks like the division of labor now what what does all this mean uh for bricks and for Russia and China they' talked about having alternatives to the dollar dollarization they've been talking about having uh alternative institutions to the international monetary Fund in the world bank but the question is now do they need an alternative institution to Nato do they need uh some kind of coordinated military plan I can understand Russia not uh not intervening in Syria at all because uh Assad was utterly incompetent utterly rigid he refused to make any kind of accommodation to anybody else uh he he was almost a nutcase and the Russians quite properly said well if the Syrian Army will not fight we're not going to send our army into there because this really isn't our fight uh if we can keep our Naval bases and our air air bases there that's all we care about uh Russia can lose Syria and it's not uh uh serious uh it's not vital uh to them but what is vital is the United States being able to now move against Iran you'd think that uh China that gets a lot of oil from Iran would would be worried and uh uh have some uh desire to intervene in the area but China's setting it out and so the Americans think well we can pick off uh one uh country after another one area after another and uh it's more than salami style we're now now going in big chunks much more than salami I don't know how uh what a good uh uh medical or culinary uh metaphor there would be but the everything's up in motion and the all of the initiative is in the N NATO uh Russia and China have said we will only react we won't act we will we will react and they're not reacting I don't know what to make of that I just uh uh I don't think anyone can foresee what's going to happen in Syria because all these Lo myid of special interests are now going to be fighting among themselves and even within the uh uh the the jihadists one Jihad group will fight against uh the other and I'm sure they'll be set against each other by the American and Israeli and British uh interveners so uh it it it's Anarchy and I don't see uh Anarchy is what what the US plan is that that's US foreign policy to be uh to back terrorists everywhere to make it impossible for other regions to have a reasonable response uh and the you'd think that the uh British countries would try to have an alternative to Anarchy I don't see any alternative uh in sight so I think the Anarchy is going to continue moving further and further Eastward Richard okay um without wanting to be always beating the same drum let me beat the same drum for me these are symptoms of the decline of the American Empire I don't think there was a Syria or to put it differently Syria was already for quite some years a society in which yes you had the the the family of of uh you know the leader uh his father and now him uh but they had lost control of good parts of that country already part of the reason the Army couldn't function was it because it wasn't the army of a of a government uh it didn't have the Loyalty already of large parts of the society it had the enmity or the disinterest uh of other parts so what you had was a Unreal Society disintegrating uh more and more into its parts and in that situation everybody looked at it and said what can I get out of this what is the least I can lose here what is the most I can gain uh and then you had very bizarre consequences the Israelis gain the part of the territory that they can immediately bomb and snatch doesn't look good it looks like Israel has opened yet another front in a war it wasn't doing so well at already you know it it ended the one in a against Hezbollah because it couldn't do it and the one in Hamas is continuing not to go all that well despite the horrific Global reputation that Israel will pay for in the decades to come I don't see them as doing very well I see them as desperate but they gain some territory and that seems to be very important for them although I don't understand how they understand that as a gain given the price they're paying then they have the fact that the jihadis who are anti-israel more intensely than almost anybody else or now have gotten stronger than they were before they had come to some kind of V you know modus vendi with the old Syrian government now they have these jihadis who are going to feel very solid there are already from what what I understand wellestablished relationships between the jihadis in Syria and Hamas in Gaza so uh that's not good for the Israelis those jihadis are going to be helping Hamas more than they were before because they're going to be able to and then I think what that Michael is right that Iran and Russia decided not to rescue uh the the Syrian leadership again they've done it in the past they didn't want to do it again because they're changing their po they're trying to figure out how now under these changed circumstances which make it in a way easier for them to change their policy because they're not betraying the sitting government of Syria which they would have been in a position of doing before so I it's not that I disagree with Michael but I add up the pieces and I don't see this as a big advance for the West I really don't and I don't think it changes the larger trajectory I think the West is losing in Ukraine which is a bigger deal than Syria by by several orders of magnitude that that defeat is continuing uh it is it is not changing I think the Chinese and the Russians and and Michael may be right the Chinese and the Russians believe that the direction of economic change in the world favors them and I think they're right and that time is not on the side of the American Empire I think they're right the United States is wielding the only weapon it still has it has lost its economic predominance it's not in a good position it tried to use economic war against Russia in Ukraine and that is an enormous failure didn't work they can't use their political position because they don't have one they're isolated they vote with the Israeli and that's about all they got as a way of of political allies everybody else is rethinking their Alliance I think you're watching by the way the slow implosion of the South Korean situation that was an American event there as best I understand the Americans had put pressure on the south Koreans to deliver huge amounts of ammunition uh 155 mimet uh artillery shells to Ukraine because nobody else can do it the South Koreans have the machinery and have the stockpiles but the the the parliament in South Korea is leftwing the majority of the parliament is leftwing and they will not permit the shipping of artillery shells for Ukraine so the only way to get that done was for the president to do what he tried to do declare martial law disand the the the the the parliament in South Korea so that he could govern and do what the Americans want not only did it did this not happen he's about to be kicked out he's gone and the Parliament is there this is a defeat for the United States potentially a very important one South Korea is I don't know seventh or eighth largest economy in the world it's a very serious business what's going on there and it will transform Asian politics well you know China Japan South Korea Philippine that that all changes so here's my conclusion Michael may be right that the next step for China and Russia will be to to formalize the bricks as not only an economic Alliance but a military Alliance and they will do that because the United States has shown that having lost its economic weapons having lost its political Global ideological position all it has left is its military superiority and it's trying to use that and it's not going well that's the reality and I think they may end up with a military feeling they have no choice because of the risk that the United States will rely more and more on Military because it has no other weapons and it'll be interesting to see whether in the early months and years of trump he how he will navigate this shrinkage of America's Global position but I I guess I disagree a bit with Michael not on any of the particulars he said those are correct but on how how he then puts it together in terms of the larger picture I don't think this is a major change in the course of events I think this is let me put it this way when Empires collapse they collapse in the sequence of the disintegration of their weakest links it's a little bit like Lenin's answer to the question why did the Socialist Revolution happen worse first in the Soviet in Russia why not in Germany why not in in England or and his answer was Russia was the peculiar weakest link on the one hand it had an advanced capitalist sector but on the other hand it was held back by a momentously backward agriculture which was 95% of the people in Russia in 1917 so it had peculiar qualities and remember Lenin devoted a a 600 page book called the economic history of Russia to explain to the people why Russia was the weakest link where socialists could I think Syria was a very weak Link in a chain that can't hold it anymore that is being ground to bits it was already a divided place it wasn't really governed by a center you know uh Assad only controlled Damascus you could see with the with hes and Hamad the two other big cities Aleppo he he controlled nothing there it was it was a fakery what he controlled I think you're just seeing these are not these are not holding and South Korea for me is another ex it's not holding it's just not holding and you're going to see odd places like South Korea and Syria and and what's going to show up is that they are each of them in their way the weak link that can't handle the deepening uh the deepening contradictions and here's an irony I think the next one may be the biggest shock and surprise of them all and that's Western Europe they are being ground Michael and I have talked about that the Europeans are being caught in an impossible situation they will have paid the biggest economic and political prize for the war in Ukraine which they are going to lose they can't hold on the United States will not hold on Ukraine will disintegrate more or less and they will have paid a price and gotten nothing and that is going to produce From Below pressures in this society that are going to be un unbelievable if Mr Merz in Germany replace and he's a right- Winger if he replaces schults that's not the solution for Germany that makes Germany's problems worse so we may be we may be talking about something much more powerful globally speaking than what happens in South Korea and Syria and soon it seems to me Michael it seems to me what has happened in Syria is was a product of of what's going on in Ukraine and in the Middle East because the United the Biden Administration was not successful in its fight against Russia in Ukraine on the other hand Israel was not successful in Gaza and in southern Lebanon that's why they went after that temporary peace and what was the latest attempt on the part of the Biden Administration let do some let's do something big in Syria and let's show the the world that we are strong we can do something big in that region we can defeat Russia and Iran at the same time in Syria well this brings up uh the point that uh Richard had said about military superiority what is military superiority well uh NATO already had no infantry superiority it had no troops uh uh there are no troops to invade a country so there's no ability to invade any country not even Syria uh NATO didn't have the arms Superior superiority anymore has no arms it used them all up uh in in Ukraine and the only kind of arms that NATO has left are the atom bombs so people think of that as the limit of military superiority but the United States has one uh kind of military superiority that's very strong that uh the bricks don't have and that's terrorism that's chaos they control terrorism Let's uh let's let's look sort of back it's hard to say what if uh would have happened but remember the estana conference and uh that settled uh Syria's uh carve up a few years ago uh the the nonn countries had everything seemingly stabilized and they had all of the Isis the terrorists uh hold up in ID idlid and then American England said the one thing uh we don't want you to do just let it's a teeny little you have 99% of all of Syria you know you you have it under your control let us keep the 1% that 1% was a a Cancer and cancer sprs spread quickly the uh the Americans have enormous superiority in terrorism uh it was enough to conquer Syria uh it it's the terrorism that was been used uh in uh Russia's Islamic uh neighboring republics uh to destabilize there uh the the bricks do not have a terrorist arm and that's certainly not their uh their strategy what can your strategy be against terrorism you know except really wiping it out like you uh they they should have said okay America is going to uh and England are going to bomb us if we wipe out idb the fact is it then took over you're going to have a war in every in any case and once you is is I said before if there's going to be a war in any case where and at what point are you going to fight it uh Russia keeps saying one red line after another after another there is dissension within Russia to say wait a minute when are you going to respond to these red lines because if you don't know each time that there's a red line that NATO expands uh Russia has less uh maneuverability Iran now has much less maneuverability what if when Iran sent the missiles to Israel that uh did not have bombs just to say look you see we can get to their defenses what if Iran had actually uh bombed Israel and stopped the expansion there would would it be in a stronger position or a worse position uh I don't know enough about the military concerns uh to say but if it at some point uh it's going to have to use its arms or else lose them what is the point of waiting what is the timing that we're talking about do they have a Time plan when they're talking to each other here's what we're going to do when and if so when are the uh key dates that they're moving on and how will they they move uh I I don't uh I don't see any indication uh I I certainly can't guess and I don't even know whether they are recognizing the fact that there is going to be an allout War uh we we're probably going to avoid atomic war at but uh they without being able to constrain the chaos and the terrorism the Americans say well ultimately chaos is it and we have the sanctions it was the sanctions that destabilized Syria uh and impoverished it all and let the Army not def fight and the population to oppose Assad uh and America still has the monetary uh domination now uh there's not really any agreement among the bricks for uh what to do monetarily so uh I I I wouldn't write off the American Empire so quickly uh it's not yet a paper tiger Richard yes well you know you may be right Michael I'm not you know I'm not convinced one way or the other about the timing I do know that the Chinese have accelerated the development of their military far beyond what they used to do even when they were already becoming a global power they seem to have understood your point and that they need to now develop uh the military capability if nothing else to push the United states away from their border there in Taiwan and the South China Sea and so on but I think they have resources if you exclude nuclear war on the grounds that it's self-defeating then let's remember you the G7 have maybe 10% of the world's population and the brick bricks have 60% it's not even close who's going to fight a a a conventional war with troops and bodies and people I mean it's horrible to contemplate and I don't want to go into the details and I'm no military expert and I don't claim to be but there is a disparity here which the United States ignores at its own Peril we're not talking about comparable entities we're talking about a very small part of the human community on one side and a very large part of the human community on the other with and that carries implications we cannot forget what even would a victory by the United States mean if it makes an enemy out of 60% of the people what kind of a victory have you established you may destroy the buildings you may destroy the economy but you got all those people who hate you who see you as the worst thing there is on Earth we have been commenting that the Israelis are undertaking a program of dominating the Middle East that will produce an entire Century of people who have lost their family members to the Israelis and will not forget this is that worth it do you realize how much you're going to pay for all of this I don't think so and I think it's going to surprise a lot of these societies on both sides countries on both both sides how this plays out I don't I don't see that the cards are that well aligned in the west I would even argue that part of the reason you have a trump phenomena is that without being explicit it is a recognition that what they've been doing doesn't work when Trump rails against you know endless war that the Democrats are the party of endless war it's a little bit of the recognition that this is not working he wouldn't oppose endless war if endless war looked like it was the solution and they can do all the skull duggery they want all of the nasty secret and they do all I mean I understand what Michael is saying but that is much easier for Russia and China to replicate because partly they already do and they can ramp all of that up that's pretty easy because it all happens below the radar and then again I want to remind people the G7 is 10% of the world's people the bricks is 60% of the world's people now and with that is an enormous disparity you do not you do not want to undertake a war under those circumstances you're not talking about the old colonial days when you have a gun and those people don't uh uh uh uh uh that's over and now the the numerical disparity begins to have its meaning it's over for the West they don't get it yet they want to act they want us all to believe but it's over and there's a relentlessness that's going on here and I still would argue that the the the disintegration of Syria whatever happens there is at least as big a problem for the West as it is for the east well I don't know if it's a matter of guns uh certainly the West does not have an advantage of guns but uh so it says how can we have a different Arena from the military Arena uh and I said terrorism is not exactly a gun but it's an uh it it's a tactic or a weapon uh that only the West has because it's only strategy precisely because it's losing the only strategy it has is chaos to prevent the U process of losing to to continue it says well we are going to lose uh we're de-industrialized uh we we don't have uh the military power the population the Infantry what we can do is just chaos and try to have other Arenas than the military uh Arena uh otherwise uh we'll lose just as we did in Ukraine again uh terrorism is one part Finance is another sanctions and trade is another corruption is another the National Endowment for democracy the United States is looking at different uh uh ways and uh you you you've seen the two big political events uh of the last two weeks besides Syria uh the elections in Romania uh and uh in in Georgia uh the the Supreme the uh NATO countries say we will only let an election be Democratic Democratic means supporting the United States uh if it if if it's a policy that does not support the United States but supports peace to uh support uh non-fighting to uh to support not fighting Russia that's not Democratic by definition that's supporting autocracies and uh we're we've nullified elections you've seen that happen twice the West has suspended elections basically you're having NATO extend its power uh o over uh countries it it it lost in Korea but I don't really know what's going to happen in Korea what is going to uh replace the US puppet uh leader uh that was there uh the all the leaders of Korea in one way or another have always felt dependence on the United States and after all the United States still has a huge military Garrison uh there so uh that we're in for a new kind of asymmetrical War uh precisely because uh NATO and the US realizes uh what Richard says that it can't fight in the way that it used to so it's being innovated Richard mention I don't I don't disagree with anything I would only say that the United States has been doing that for a long it has been using terrorism and covert actions uh periodically they are exposed here in the United States and we get to see uh the extent of it which is remarkable and there's no reason to presume that that hasn't continued and if anything become a more generalized ized approach but again I understand it I can't foresee the future they may be able to reverse but the bricks for all of the heterogeneous nature of the bricks the the odd countries that are getting together that very oddness tells you that there's something bigger going on that these people are being carried along even though they don't fit together very well and yet they are becoming de facto allies of Russia and China look even you know I mean you know this but I I want to say it again the war in Ukraine as defense secretary Austin said at the outset early in 2022 was designed to weaken and hopefully break up Russia that is a colossal failure I mean that that is a failure epic in terms of what it has done in my judgment in terms of bringing Russia China India and the whole bricks forward by several orders of magnitude in a much condensed period of historical time and the United States is you know it can't get out of this war that's its problem now because it is so counterproductive to what it's trying to do it's shown the whole world that the Russians have military capability no one would have ascribed to them before not even them let alone anybody else th this is I mean you'd have to really bet Bend yourself into a pretzel to make this a success of the west and yet they have invested enormously into it and the weakening of NATO strikes me as I mean I I have family in France I've never heard them talk the way I hear them talk now they are against their own country's leadership and its foreign policy on a scale you know there's a reason why the yellow vests happen there there's a reason why the left parties got together and are now the biggest uh Block in the National Assembly Mr mcon is is a is a lame duck leader he's got the same political power that Mr Biden now has that is next to none and Mr Schultz is right there behind them and those are the two powerhouses England is a joke you know a bad joke and they are all squeezing their working class which is only making their situation worse the Germans are look VW is out on strike they can't VW has proposed a 10% cut in the wages of its workers that's its proposal of course they're out on strike they have a horrible inflation and they're being told their money wages are going down by 10% and the way VW goes is the way the rest of Germany goes they are a dominant force in that country and on and on and on you know this this the government fell last week in in Paris because their budget had had uh service cuts to the mass of people which they don't want they won't tolerate the right-wing and the left wing together are the overwhelming majority and they vote voted the government out and they're not going to let another one like it in so the the West has extraordinary problems of its own that it it it is not it's not in a strong position well what Richard's comment is leading to is uh what we haven't discussed yet who really is the greatest enemy of uh NATO and the United States Empire well it's the United States uh it's going to be the Trump Administration all the empires have always fallen from within uh and uh it's the self-destructive character uh of uh both the United States uh uh and and NATO uh being torn apart by the fact of Americans demands that NATO bear the costs of America's new Cold War that's going to be uh what really uh throws uh its weight in the equation I think much more than uh the uh Chinese and Russian and British response right now it's the United States that's self-destructing and Europe that's self-destructing and uh is is leading to uh elections that we we just mentioned a few minutes ago where populations uh elected people who do not support NATO and NATO and the government is strong enough to say we control the dictatorships in Europe so strongly that it uh as Angelina barbach said it doesn't matter what the voters for us wanted we're running the show uh so the question is is this going to uh weaken uh NATO and be a sign of political uh falling apart as Richards described is happening in France but is also happening in Germany and elsewhere or is NATO going to win and say we are now a totalitarian state uh uh that's what a democracy is De democracy means uh you you don't have a vote because that's instability as opposed to the autocracies that are supporting uh policies that uh the population wants that's the real question uh before us uh who who will uh conquer the American plan for world domination America or the bricks listen I like what M what Michael just did I I think it is correct once you survey the international to have the very process of what we just did looking at the international take us back where it should take us to that point that Michael correctly makes that the empires of the world large and small usually implode they are not usually conquered and remember the Soviet Union fell apart in 198 9 not because the United States did this or that but be I mean the United States's Behavior had a role to play of course it's not that the external plays no role that's not what Michael is saying but he's saying that the focus where we should look for the key elements emerging is domestic and I would like to take that another step and talk about something that happened here in New York City last week and I think it's directly relevant I I if the Press can be believed and I always say that I'm not sure it can but if it can they have arrested a young man and the young man they have arrested they arrested uh or they will charge him with shooting the CEO of the United healthc Care Corporation which is a med medical insurance uh giant the biggest of the medical insurance corporations he shot him on a New York Street and killed him okay this killing could have been dealt with in the way Americans deal with killings which is to say our thoughts and prayers go to the victims family because of their tragedy and their suffering however the overwhelming majority of comments and we're talking now about Millions because we're talking social media Tick Tock Instagram Twitter X or all of them the overwhelming comments were not about the victim or the act of murder they were expressions of unmistakable sympathy with what was explained as the likely motivation of the murder because of the words delay and deny and so forth on the casings of the bullets that were used okay what did the people say the people of America said they are outraged I am now interpreting but I don't think there's much dispute here they are outraged at the suffering imposed on the American people by the insurance companies that take their money and then deny or delay uh covering their medical needs when they have an injury or an illness well I remember enough about my reading of gorilla Warfare and social change what we just saw in the United States was a population whose sympathy is on the side of Robin Hood and not against the people that Robin Hood has stuck an arrow into and that is a sign if I were a leader of the United States this would worry me on a scale that makes Syria and South Korea irrelevant unimportant what you just saw was a statement and by the way it's confirmed I've done the statistics the cost of Medical Care is out of control in the United States and has been only becoming more so we have a de facto Monopoly here it's called or it should be called the medical industrial complex it is the drug companies the hospitals the doctors and the medical insurance companies those four Industries comprise a collective Monopoly and they have achieved what no other Medical system has in Europe or anywhere else it costs more to get medical care in the United States than anywhere in the world the drugs cost more the hospital stay costs more the doctor's fees are greater You Name It We overpay for it something on the order near 20% of GDP is going into the medical profession because they can demand it they've got a Monopoly and people are revolting and you had the Vanguard of the Revolt in that young young man from a wealthy family in in Pennsylvania and Maryland a graduate of University of Pennsylvania which is an Ivy League institution in this country he knows what he's doing he understands what's at stake he knows he's taking an advanced position and now that's been confirmed by the mass reaction that's a sign of a system disintegrating from within and it's Crystal Clear that the people who run these institutions this Monopoly are Full Speed Ahead doing what they've been doing they're not stopping they're not slowing nothing and that's true for all the other leaders of this Society political and economic which means you've got a train heading towards a stone wall with no concept of what is about to happen so it's not really out of control at all is it Richard it's thoroughly in control it's in control of by the monopolies and uh it would be if people uh read the comments in support of the shooter the uh the most striking comments are by the doc by doctors and it's the doctors who are complaining not merely the patients uh and part of this is because of the way in which private Equity has taken over medical professions uh the doctor that I'd had for the last 20 years uh his practice has just sold out to a uh uh private Capital controller and uh uh the the doctor I was who took his place has 2,000 patients well I don't know how a doctor if you have a one annual visitor things uh 2,000 patients uh I don't think he'd have much time for me and uh I I've had uh occasion to have some medical treatment at a hospital and uh every doctor's limited the amount of time uh they can meet with me uh to 20 minutes uh it it it's turned out that way I don't know what they have in their schedule or what they're billing for it but in my experience is 20 minutes including with the uh the medic the private physician that uh I used to have so the whole treatment of medical conditions has been changed quite a bit and it's uh the uh it's disrupted the whole American Medical association's fight against what it called socialized medicine uh it's avoided socialism and what it has is the horrors of privatized private Capital Med medicine and uh it's the private uh privatization uh and control by the pharmaceutical and health insurance companies that have taken away the power that doctors thought that they were going to uh uh be able to avoid by fighting socialism it turns out that a a public uh medic IAL care A Single Payer uh where doctors uh were paid for actually keeping people healthy uh would have been uh much more amenable both to doctors and their patients than uh the system you have where uh the doctor simply takes your blood tests and other tests they do they have a a checklist and doctors are now part of the automatic intelligence uh they say do the tests here's what it says to do there's there's no time for doctors to use judgment uh in the United States that's what my retiring uh personal physician said he said it used to be that doctors knew the patients they were able to uh take uh consideration of the whole body not just here's a heart problem here's a a weight problem here's this but now it's just everything is uh cut in in parts and it's all following a schematic computer-driven automatic response uh to everything so yes that's part of the CL Medical Care is certainly part of the claping within here just as it is in in Britain yeah I I can give you another example even though I understand we're Shifting the conversation but you know it used to be a kind of common sense that you can judge an economic system according to how well it provides food clothing and shelter and then you can add Medical Care and education and a few other things but we have also right alongside our Medical Care crisis a housing crisis the cost of housing and rent is off the chart we used to have a rule of thumb that if you spend more than 25% of your income on housing you're being abusively treated in your economy you can't do it well now the majority of Americans are spending more than 25% of their income on housing I mean it's a failure it's it's like the medical care it's a failure it's a fa the system isn't working these things can be handled one by one they can be disguised by a public mass media system that refuses to expose the reality that's like this terrorism that Michael talked about can be used to solve certain kinds of problems in the world but in the end you can't do it all you can't terrorize the world and terrorize your own people out of a standard of living that they were led to expect as their entitlement the American people don't have 300 years of abysmal poverty as their comparison they have the middle of the 20th century when they had a really pretty good standard of living that is being taken away from them and that is a powerful stimulant to the kinds of activities we saw on the street in Manhattan last week this is a society that is appearing and again let me tell you about emails I get from Europe they don't want to visit here as tourists anymore my family for fear that they are going to be shot on the street by somebody for something now that's an exaggeration I tell them that but there's a deeper meaning to their anxiety that there there is a shift going on and there's no end to that that isn't going to get better that's going going to get worse there's nothing indicating that it's going to get better if anything the very mentality of Mr Trump and of the people he's bringing into power show you that they are upward and onward with more of this they want less government and less social support okay that's going to make the rich richer but that's not the solution to this country's problems quite the contrary okay so that when President Trump says make America great again he doesn't mean uh going back to what Richard has uh described the way it used to be where everybody could afford uh afford a house and everybody could afford Medical Care uh it it's uh make America even less great by going down the same uh line it's interesting that the three points that we've discussed are what I I brought up so often the fire sector Finance insurance and real estate uh we started by talking about the health insurance and uh uh the shooter said this is not terrorism this is a revolution A revolution is not terrorism we're trying to overthrow the system uh Richard just bought housing okay real estate insurance and then behind the whole system is finance because just two days ago uh I think a combination of Blackstone uh and other companies uh have uh developed huge uh rental housing projects most of the construction in the United States now is not creating housing to send to sell to homeowners it's creating housing to sell to financial organizations that are buying them as absentee land loaders realizing that now that uh the uh President Obama has started the big downward slope to replace a home ownership Society with a landlord Society now uh there are fewer and fewer homes available to be sold and we as uh landlords uh can charge uh whatever we want we can do what landlords in the 19th century uh were trying to do and the whole purpose of classical economics was to take away their power but uh the power that landlords used to have over uh Europe has now been taken over by the financial sector and rent is for paying interest uh because the financial companies basically borrow cheaply buy the rental housing increase uh the costs and uh they've they now have computerized programs to uh it's sort of like a computerized conspiracy the computer tell you exactly how much uh you can charge for what the market will bear if the absolute limit so the proportion of housing charges relative to personal income in the United States is going up and up and up much more than 25% in New York I think there's a a big SWAT of the population that pays over half of their income for housing now that's why they're so uh there's so so many vacancies in the office buildings people cannot come to New York and accept a job where half of their income will be paying for rent so the office buildings are empty causing uh the incipient real estate crisis of holding these zombie Office Buildings uh off the market it's lend and pretend uh the banks are lending the money to pay the mortgage so they won't have to suddenly recognize that the housing the the real estate uh for commercial buildings has been all hollowed out in the United States because of this and this hollowing out of housing has aggravated the health and insurance problem because the uh the uh Center for Disease Control says we cannot have people wear masks we cannot stop the covid spread or the bird flu spread by uh having better air conditioning or by having people wear masks because uh if we do that then they'll stay home instead of going to the buildings we we need them to uh to uh to pretend that there's no danger uh of covid or at all so that they can go back into the offices so that they can pay rents so that the owners of the building can pay the mortgages that they owe to the banks so that the banks won't uh go bust because uh all of a sudden their mortgages have fallen uh uh drastically in value so the whole fire sector is interconnected that's the achill heel of the American economy and Beyond it the American Empire yeah and and that's where in my judgment that's where the Relentless pressure begins that then takes the form of troubles abroad because it really is your home situation that is constraining you you can't you can't do this you you can't do that uh and so you can't do abroad what you once were able to do when you were King of the Hill coming out of World War II the United States was King of the Hill if the dollar is the Global Currency you can do all kinds of things you can't do if the go dollar isn't I mean it shows up as an inability to get the the head of the Central Bank in Malaysia to do what you want but it starts with the inability of you to hold on at home to the position you once were able to to occupy that's what happened to the Soviet Union it couldn't it could not wage an arms race with the United States and occupy Afghanistan and it couldn't do it it could have done one or the other maybe at a certain point it could have done them all but by the time we're talking about it it had too many demands if you can allow me on the Surplus It produced it could not satisfy those demands there wasn't enough Surplus to enable them to do it and at that point your system collap you you know it it can't function I don't know when that's coming in this country but I have a very strong sense that that's where we are that that that is what is happening and bit by bit person by person country by country weaker link less weak link you are uncovering signs of that the Europeans look the Europeans have enjoyed an extraordinary game ever since the end of World War II the United States told them we will protect you against the Russians and we will and you have no other enemy we will protect you you don't have to spend the money on military we will and we'll do it because our government by supporting our military can give the fiscal stimulus to our economy without which we would go back into depression so we're going to do it and you have an opportunity to provide services to your business community and to your working class without taxing them the money it would cost to have in addition a military so you'll be able to tax them less and yet provide what they need it's Nirvana for you as a politician but the deal is you've got to be the faithful agent of the United States as your military umbrella that's what the deal was and that worked very well it allowed the Germans to have their vir vunder under Conrad Adenauer and everything that has come since it allowed the anti-communist uh leadership of Italy and France and Britain to come to the top they could deliver through the alliance of NATO with the United States they could deliver more than anybody else and they could this was a very well worked out deal that is now over that that's what Mr Trump is trying to tell people I'm not paying for this I'm not doing this anymore not because I don't want to because I can't I'm not doing I'm not even going to maintain our military anymore and I'm sure as hell not going to do it for you I'll do the military but I'll do now does he understand what that will do to the American economy no will it do damage here I guess so but first and foremost it's going to  the Europeans why because all of those faithful pro-american the beach in Germany or starmer in England or maon or Maloney even these people in Europe they can't deliver what they were elected to deliver because the United States is saying to them you either develop your own military which will cost you a fortune or you're at our mercy and we're going to sacrifice you and you know how well look at what we're doing to you now we're depriving you of cheap energy and we're doing nothing to help you penetrate the Chinese market without the Chinese market on the one hand and the cheap energy from Ria and on the other they're finished they're dead they're gone and the the the public in Europe is confronting that reality what are we gonna do in this situation where there is no exit where we go what and they are being offered by their leadership nothing continued subordination to the United United States which is for them a road down or the scary Prospect of breaking away from the United States which is for them a frightening new development that they haven't seriously considered for 75 years the left and the right want to go in the New Direction the middle is terrified and that's European politics right this minute and nobody knows where that's going to go but talk about the future we might have NATO without Europe which is back to the United States and that's not going to strengthen the United States it's going to weaken it if you remember Donald Trump in his first term he was talking about building a wall between the United States and Mexico he said I'm going to build a wall and Mexico going to pay for it and right now with with these tariffs tariffs he's going to put on Europeans and I do believe the way that he's talking about China the tariffs would be on the people in the United States and they're going to hit back this policy is going to hit back and Y they're gonna yeah of course and and it's going to begin when Americans understand that the Tariff is paid by Americans not not not by these other countries paid by americ Americans first and foremost it may part of it may then be picked up by The Foreigner to accommodate but the the the Tariff is going to be a burden on the American economy look there's something if I if you allow me there's something wonderful about a republican conservative let's remember the Republican party is the political party that for the last Century has prided itself on being the party against taxes that's how it runs every election ever for president for Senator for representative for mayor of the town for governor of the state I'm against taxes and what does Mr Trump have as his number one economic PR program tariffs well tariffs are a tax tariffs is just the name of a particular tax namely a tax on imported goods and services that are produced in another country and come into your country for final sale in other words the anti-tax party has become the protax party you know what that's a sign of that everything's changing that nothing we are at a moment of enormous shifts this party is become and by the way this will be the name of that party from now on it will be attacked by the Democrats for having hurt us with these T that you can see it coming this kind of transformation that's a sign of social change if ever you needed one the old arrangements are finished we are in a new place and I understand that people are worried and frightened about it but it is as dramatically changing here as it is in Syria or South Korea or France or anywhere else where we see more headlines those headlines they are coming here and they're coming here soon yeah thank you so much Richard for being with us today Michael is he's gonna be back but we we we have to wrap it up right now thank you so much Richard great pleasure all right thank you till next time next time byebye
