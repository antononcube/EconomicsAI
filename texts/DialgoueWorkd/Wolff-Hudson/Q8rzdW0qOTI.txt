hi everybody today is Thursday December 26th and Professor Richard Wolff is back with us welcome back Richard thank you very much Nima glad to be here Richard let's let's get started with what Donald Trump has said recently about Greenland about Panama and before that he talked about Canada being if the the as a state of the United States as a new state of the United States here is what he what there is a report on on the MSNBC if I'm not mistaken they're talking about the history of Panama like Trump's holiday social media posts which are raising new questions about his future goals for the US overseas Trump took to truth social on Christmas Day and expanded on some past statements he's made suggesting the us could control Greenland Canada and the Panama Canal as well once he takes office coming up in January NBC News White House correspondent Aaron gilchrest joins us now with the latest on this Aaron good morning so this isn't the first time we've heard some alarm over the president's social media posts of course and on this same topic he's previously said the US is being ripped off when it comes to the Panama Canal he's criticized those fees that Panama charges to use it so what exactly is he calling for now and is there any broader context we should be looking at behind this well I think we're all getting a little bit of a history lesson and a geography lesson in having these conversations new about places like the Panama Canal and Greenland and things of that sort uh the reality is that the US signed a treaty with Panama back in the 70s that started the process of the US giving up control of the Panama Canal that happened in 1999 and so this uh major uh Transit point is a way that ships get uh from the Atlantic ocean to the Pacific Ocean and vice versa without having to go all the way around the southern tip of uh South America the the president-elect has suggested that the panamanians are charging us businesses too much Fe too much money to be able to use the Panama Canal uh to move their goods around and as a result of that he he sort of threatened to to to take back control of the Panama Canal yeah Richard when it comes it seems to me that is a the policy of fighting China has already started in the mind of Donald Trump and he's trying to do something how how do you find it in your opinion what is the main reason what is the main objective of the of these type of talks right now well partly well it's many things so I'm not going to look for the key one I don't believe in that it's always a combination of of factors that are going going on I would like to begin however with just a comment given what we have been discussing now for weeks and months you and I and Michael Hudson and so on uh in Europe the way rightwing governments have been mobilizing their people over the last three years against Russia in the Ukraine war has been by making a claim that what Mr Putin in Russia is about is not so much Ukraine but his intention to grab that the language now to grab more of Europe that he has uh imperialistic or colonialisation about a greater Russia that might include you know who knows what parts of Northern Central you know this is regularly discussed in the media of of lvia Lithuania and Estonia but far beyond that in Central Europe in Western Europe it's a very popular way for sitting right-wing or center right political leaders to justify the amount of their resources they are devoting to the Ukraine war the amount of their resources they are devoting to other anti-russian measures and as many commentators not me particular but as many commentators have pointed out and here let me just cite uh professor John mimer of the University of Chicago who keeps saying the same thing as an academic that there is no evidence of anything that the Russians would do and and moreover Common Sense would tell you that if the Russians were to do anything like that the opposition they would get from within all of those countries would make it militarily economically as well as politically a catastrophe for the Russians and there's therefore no evidence they're going to do that and no logic it's going to be difficult for the right-wing governments of Europe to keep talking like this when the absence of evidence that Russia is colonialism moving forward after what we've just seen from Mr Trump this is the Resurgence of American colonialism now so far it's only words it's Mr Trump drawing attention being in the headlines look otherwise he would have been out of the headlines and we would all all have been talking about Christmas now in this way we were talking not only about Christmas but Mr Trump again and it's even more interesting because one of the countries offended by Mr Trump's colonialism remarks is a part of Europe Denmark since Denmark is the governing authority of Greenland longstanding I no one except the United States seems to want to dispute that you know a little while ago Mr Trump in his first Administration spoke about buying Greenland and Denmark had to tell him that it wasn't for sale okay in true Colonial fashion he's now suggesting that if he can't buy it he will take it by force now I want to remind you what the Europeans including particularly Danish political leaders have said about Russia's colonialism for which there is no comparable statements by Mr Putin whatsoever but here we have the leader of the United States speaking about directly threat ening a European country Denmark over a colonial possession uh that the United States is thinking about it is for sheer political stupidity I don't know what other words to use for it but nothing is ever simple and it's not simply a matter of Mr trump bloviating it that's part of what it is but it's not only that here's a more serious way to understand all of this when Empires decline when it becomes more and more difficult for an existing Empire to hold on to its dominant Global position which is what Empire means the United States has been the dominant glor Global power for almost a century now but in the last 15 years all of that has begun to Peak it's over we are now on the downside of the American Empire and it is very typical for the United States to be engaged on the one hand in denial that anything like that is going on on there is no Empire United States very rarely admitted that it had an Empire it it it needed to talk about democracy all the time not about Empire occasionally but mostly it had to deny the Empire and so it has become quite easy to deny that the Empire is over and we are busy denying that for example we just had a presidential election during that presidential election neither Mr Trump who won nor M Harris who lost ever said to my knowledge one word about a declining Empire not at all the the closest you came was the passing remarks of Mr Trump that because he has to make America great again he has to find things now that he can change he can fix to make it great again but mostly that's General rhetoric no admission that there is an Empire that it is declining you know he we wouldn't talk like that and unfortunately kamla Harris didn't talk like that either so that's the denial part but here comes the other way declining Empires deal they make gestures of fighting to become larger in other words they negate the downturn by becoming larger finding a nearby poor weak country or region which they can take and it's not so much that they need the particular resource there aren't that great resource in Greenland as far as I know but there might be but it's not you know it's not a burning necessity whatever it is Greenland has I don't know I'm a reasonably well-informed uh person looking at these issues I'm not aware of Greenland having anything to do with anything and the United States pays fees at the Panama Canal it has always paid fees and like everything else it's remarkable for a republican who doesn't like a an outcome of the market Panama is a poor country a small poor country it lives off the Panama Canal it charges as much as it can it it's limited because every shipper has the option of go shipping some other way either having the ships go around which is expensive or using other mechanisms so there are Market limits as there always are but instead of celebrating the market here we have this conservative uh Expositor of free markets saying is going to use military power violate a treaty that has been approved by the United States Senate the treaty back in the 1970s it's it's Crystal Clear who owns the Panama can who's just going to take this is bravado this is gesture you know and then there's the the game uh the non too subtle game of suggesting that Canada you know is a 51st state of the United States and suggesting that if Mexico doesn't behave properly he might invade Mexico they're the Excuse excuse me the reason is the drug trade which is half a century old now if not older um so these are gestures that are typical of a declining Empire flexing its muscle mostly to convince itself that it's not declining and you know the angry response of the Danes of the Canadians of the Mexicans and also of the panamanians indicates that Mr Trump like his advisors simply live in a bubble in which the rest of the world's Evolution being frightening to them simply isn't relevant they will like a child cover their eyes and if they can't see it then they hope it isn't there children usually grow up pretty quick and discover that you can do that was still there so here we have in the same period of this decline these actions of expansion of a of an Empire growing they love the imagery but let me give you the other side the bricks the bricks going into 2025 in other words going into something that begins in a few days have announced they are now ass system with nine members nine Partners that's 18 and another four countries that have been invited to become members but have not yet decided although they the four countries are Vietnam Algeria Nigeria and turkey those four are expected to join but they haven't yet but they are already 18 nine members nine Partners as of January 1 2025 and let me remind everyone these 18 are just short of of population wise half of the people of planet Earth of of of the planet we all share so half of them are in that and the leaders of that are Russia China and India who are politically all on the other side of the war in Ukraine just for people to understand and they are making that War uh a war that Russia will win is winning okay what else are they together they're about 41% I've done the work of the GDP of this world if you use purchasing power parity calculations which are the better ones to get a real realistic sense of what these numbers mean by comparison 41% the G7 the United United States and its major allies are 30% okay 41% of the world's wealth and including its capacity to produce more wealth 41% in the bricks 30% in the United States and its major allies which are Canada Japan Britain France Italy and Germany wow wow wow economic growth this year again I've mentioned this before but it in this context the IMF says the United States will grow 2.8% for the year 2024 every other country in the G7 will grow less than 2.8% Russia will grow more China will grow 4.8% and India will grow 7% the Gap is getting wider the relative economic footprint of the G7 is shrinking this is an empire in Decline with his statistics screaming that reality but not in the United States not in the regime of Donald Trump oh no he we are expanding if the United States cannot grow faster then perhaps Mr Trump has in his mind that the way we will grow is not by developing our own economy but rather by snatching the resources of other countries absorb Canada absorb Mexico or parts of them or Panama or Greenland or fill in the blank where else will he will he go excuse me the uh the remarkable thing Nima is this these are signs of living in a fantasy of of imagining possibilities that aren't there because you are so determined not to see what is and in that way if you allow me I'll show you a link between that and Ukraine on the one hand and political changes coming on the other first on Ukraine the Ukraine is the same blindness denial the United States thought that it could expand NATO to include Ukraine obviously what the United States wanted it's what the uh the leadership that the United States helped to produce uh back in 2014 with the overthrow of the Old Government etc etc I won't you know that history and so does your audience I assume so the calculation was made this is going to be easy we're going to fight Russia Russia is much poorer than the United States it is Russia is in deep trouble with all of the consequences of the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1989 that's true too and that Russia you know is afraid of the United States's nuclear weapons which is also true Russia is very aware that the United States dropped atomic bombs in Japan and is there the only country in the world's ever done that and everybody who thinks about this understands what that implies so a calculation was obviously made why do I say obviously because President Biden immediately after Russia invades Ukraine early in 2022 declares as do Mr blinkin Jake Sullivan the other advisors around Mr Biden and leading members of the United States Senate and House of Representatives they all say this will be easy we will destroy Russia we will weaken Russia to the point where it may break apart the value of the ruble will be zero be nothing this they can't stand up to the Ukrainian Army funded and equipped by the United States and Western Europe they were sure of it they wouldn't need nuclear weapons they could F because they're afraid of that obviously everybody is but they wouldn't need that it was wrong it was wrong Russia didn't collapse Russia is stronger militarily and economically today than it was when this War Began or even if that's not true it's certainly stronger than we were told by our governments we were told Russia could would collapse Russia couldn't possibly sustain this War I want to remind everyone the line of contact between the Russian military and the Ukrainian military has moved steadily Westward that means Russia's power is growing geographically and that of Ukraine and the collective West is shrinking in Europe today the assumption is that there will be a ceasefire that there will be negotiations and that Russia will keep much or all of what it has conquered militarily I mean in the United States we don't dare have conversations about all of this publicly privately they're there but publicly not that's part of Deni you made a terrible mistake and even if Americans don't see it everywhere else in the world I read foreign newspapers every other country is taking note of what I just said that the predictions of the West as to the weakness of the East were wrong the east in this case Russia is much stronger than we were told to believe the winner in Ukraine is clear militarily the econom of Russia has problems it it always has it even had that before the Soviet Union collapsed it has had extreme difficulties making the transition from what it was to what it is now but that doesn't tell you anything because that's a constant it's changing but it's it's an economy so having Mr blinkin and Mr Sullivan give speeches the last two or three weeks talking about the inflation in Russia and the this is make belief for Americans again it's not relevant their economic growth is faster they've used the war to get out of many of their economic Pro not all but many which in if you know anything about American history shouldn't surprise you how did the United States get out of the Great Depression World War I War put people back to work that's what it did in Russia too it revived their economy it stimulated their economy did they have to go into debt to do that yes just like the United States did during World War II that was a time of booming American debt but everyone understood that that war showed how powerful the United States was then and that's again the problem we aren't anymore we aren't in that position the rest of the world is not in the position it was then all of these things are denied and as the result terrible mistakes are being made it's clear in the case of Ukraine the West didn't understand that Russia can sell oil and gas to India and China if it doesn't sell it to Western Europe not a problem you misunderstood that's one of the reasons Russia can fight the war it can sell oil and gas to pay for the war etc etc and the United States cannot prevent it it uses one escalation after another I mean escalation militarily by supplying F-16 Fighters supplying Abram's tanks and all the things which they said at the beginning wouldn't be necessary they wouldn't do it uh they did it but it didn't change anything likewise they started with some sanctions and they have escalated the level of sanctions ever since and that doesn't work either you know if you're doing one policy after another and it doesn't work if you're rational at that point you begin to ask well maybe larger issues are going on here that we didn't take into account enough that's rational what we're not doing that we cannot go there the larger issue is the declining Empire and that's not that's a taboo we cannot discuss that in the United States and we punish people around the world who talk like that or we try to as a nation not working out very well either okay that mistake is now being made again that's what is going on when Mr Trump suggests taking over Canada can you imagine with me all of you watching this program what is going through the minds of the millions of Canadians and the millions of Mexicans and the millions of Danish people come on what what are you doing it's like with Ukraine the whole world is watching you lose the war you keep saying you're winning you're winning Mr Zen keeps saying I'm winning I'm winning but nobody believes this anymore and that becomes a kind of pathology and so now we have announcements of colonial expansion it's as if Mr Trump by mere assertion is going to reverse the one thing that has been true throughout the period of the American Empire it's the end of colonialism India was but isn't a colony Africans were but aren't anymore Colonial territory the direction of change is anti colonialism vers virtually everywhere and the two countries alone in the world that are now actively advocating colonialism are Israel in in the Palestinian territories and now the United States who are often together the only two votes in the United Nations this should worry you if you're an American or an Israeli the strategy after World War II was to isolate communism the great danger to the West well communism is largely gone but the West has isolated itself not the rest of the world in fact the rest of the world making common cause with the Communist parties around the world is by far the dominant Block in the world today China One a Communist party is the Undisputed leader of the bricks group Cuba is now a member of the bricks Vietnam is a member of the brick and so on Russia obviously but these are signs United States is therefore setting itself against it one of the reasons the United States never called itself an Empire except privately was because they understood that the world was moving away and they like to remind people that once the United States was a colonial territory that had to fight to break away from the dominant Britain but nobody was fool they understood that the United States was replacing the European Colonial Powers not refusing to C and now with Mr Trump at the end of the process when the Old Colonial world doesn't exist anymore he's announcing he's now going to be an explicit Colonial I mean it you're watching denial become craziness it's when the denial is so deep and so comprehensive that's what coming out of your mouth makes you look well what is the phrase used in international Politics the Rogue State the government that is much more a threat to global stability than it is the upholder of global stability we are living through that transition and these Christmas remarks of a colonialist nature are very powerful symptoms and symbols of what we are living through Richard it seems right now in Europe the European leaders and people are so confused because we know that how much the war in Ukraine and the conflict in Ukraine has hit the economy of Europe and those policies of tariffs from Donald Trump in his first term and then by Joe Biden and right now with Donald Trump in Washington it's going to worsen the situation between the United States and China and that would influence Europe as well how do you see the new leaders of Europe and what is going on in their mind because it seems that Donald Trump would be their next enemy well I think honestly what they're doing now is virtually a kind of panic Behavior orsula vladen Uh the others it's it's pathetic as they run around these are people who are afraid for good reason that their political dominance is about to collapse they they've lived under the protection and Shadow of the United States ever since World War II um some would argue it goes back even to World War I but it's a long time 75 years 100 years it's a long time and it has trained two to three to four generations of European leaders that the United States is the dominant power and you can succeed in your country in Germany in Italy in France by granting the United States the leadership it wants you get an exchange of fantastic service you can have a powerful military without having to pay for a powerful military that is the United States provides the nuclear military umbrella it is true it is to the benefit in the Keynesian economic sense it's in the benefit of American capitalism because this Global nuclear military umbrella that the United States provides to Nato and Europe but also globally all of that is mostly money spent by the United States on United States corporations there is some spillover to foreign they get foreign companies are uh subsidiaries or input providers to American defense but it's mostly a a support to American capitalism you know the the budget of this of the United States this year will spend U about a trillion dollars if you do it properly on defense spending that's an enormous subsidy because it goes overwhelmingly to large corporations who then spend some of it on smaller ones feeder corporate but it's an enormous military industrial complex the Europeans get the benefit of that including the very important symbolic location of American troops in various European countries without having to pay for it they can therefore use the revenue they take from their own people and use it partly to subsidize their industry helping them to compete with America the contradictions are rich but they can also provide what they would have had to in Europe or else even the United States couldn't have saved them at the end of World War II they can provide a welfare support to defeat socialism to keep Russia on the eastern half of Europe but to keep the Western half free of socialism by having a a social safety net which they could never have afforded otherwise but which gave them social peace without having to pay what that would have cost because they couldn't have afforded it otherwise I try to remind people my family is French so when my French family goes to the doctor they don't pay anything for it when my French family reaches the age uh having finished school to go into the labor force the employer has to give them five weeks of paid vacation every year which is when I go to France and spend time and see them because we have five weeks I don't get that in the United States American workers do not get these things free education free medical care and five weeks paid vacation and I could go on but the Europeans provide that socialists fought for it but the capitalists made a deal okay we'll give you that you let us keep the Enterprises we're the capitalists but we'll give you a standard of living that will make your socialism unnecessary wow that deal worked in Europe still does but now the United States whose Empire is shrinking doesn't want to pay for what it is it doesn't want this game to continue because it isn't enough for the United States and they're right the United States spends a fortune on this military they would like to be able to spend a little less so they turn to the Europeans and they begin to press they've been doing that for years but they're pressing harder now but the Europeans can't where are they going to where are they going to do tax their own people they will be voted out of office these right-wingers they can't survive they're supposed to be anti-tax they have been celebrating dishonestly for decades see we're not having to raise taxes yeah that's because you sold out your country to America and and the left knows that in Europe and uses that argument and nobody has refuted it not successfully it sits right there and if the right-wing governments have to come in and cut Social spending and raise taxes which is what they're trying to do look at the pathetic uh Immanuel macron he tried to do it he's now dead Pol politically then he appointed illegally and unethically he appointed a prime minister having lost the election the Prime Minister tried to cut Social spending and raise taxes he lasted a matter of weeks now he's brought in another one who who will repeat this absurd they're stuck and they're frightened because they're stuck as they should be but they too are acquired by the support they get from the United States to also say nothing about the end of the Empire and when they confront the growing number of us who see that the Empire or if you like the emperor has no clothes remember the Fable the Empire is naked and looks like it's shrinking then they get into difficulty with the United States you can't do that you can't sustain it look it's a lesson that has to be learned apparently every generation and the lesson is the very things that make a certain arrangement of the world economy functional and successful all over time turn into Fetters great word of marxis what what is an engine of growth becomes an obstacle to growth that's how things evolve that's how people react to a situation trying to find ways to profit from it and as they do they change the environment so the old conditions are no longer Progressive they are regressive and they have to be changed we are at that point now we are at a a crisis point if you like a shifting in the world and that's difficult always has been difficult in the past it's going to be difficult now but denying that it's going on I wouldn't give that too many more months or years to survive right below the surface in Europe there is a very active conversation that I know about from my own personal interactions there are plenty of businesses that understand what you said Neema that understand that they are paying a heavy price to the United States for what they're getting much higher than the price they used to have to pay the Volkswagen Corporation the symbol the emblem of a powerful European economy built around Germany whose economy in turn was built around exports and those the dominant one to Volkswagen okay they just went through the worst economic crisis of their existence as a corporation they tried to impose on the German working class a fantastic cut for those of you who don't know they they demanded 10% reduction of wages across the board let me repeat that not only no increase not only no keeping up with the inflation which is going on but a reduction of money wages by 10% on top of what you're losing by the inflation they were going to close three of the nine VW factories in Germany they were going to move production to Mexico they're still going to do some of those things but they're not going to be able to cut the wages they're not going to be able to close three factories that's the deal they made with the workers union the Union in turn agreed to no wage increase in 2025 or 2026 they won't suffer a 10% cut but they won't get anything these are two years during which there's every reason to expect a significant inflation and then they will be behind no wage increase Rising prices you lose they're so frightened they accepted that as a deal VW still allowed to reduce by 35,000 the number of their employees via attrition okay what you're watching here is a downturn of German capital capitalism that's what this is because you can be sure that when the biggest most powerful Corporation in your country the symbol of what you have achieved agrees to this catastrophe then all the others will have varying greater or lesser cutbacks and Germany was the engine for Europe This is you're putting the Europeans under incredible political ideological strain and Mr Trump living in the bubble where he can be Mr tough guy against the Europeans look he has already threatened them with tariffs since the election he's threatened Mexico Canada and the Europeans with with tariffs okay these are his little weapons they don't have much else so he brandishes the tariffs these are all signs of growing stresses inside a declining Empire that's it is classic it's almost as if we were rehearsing a script passed down from our history and yet it has to be still so far relatively few voices that articulate this and I want to say as I've said to you before I'm happy to come on to your program because you are one of the places where this can be spoken where people can hear this argument and then make their own decisions how much of it they want to incorporate into their own thinking how much they don't uh but at least we are not playing the game of putting our hands in front of our eyes in order to make it I saw in recent days more than I could even believe statements here in the United States I'm speaking to you from New York City about how marvelously great our economy and Society are it is amazing it is the article is between two the the one I believe was coming from Jake Sullivan or Mr blinkin I can't remember but it was sandwiched between two articles one was about uh murder in the subway system of New York City my wife will not go in the Subways of New York which are by far the best means of transportation around the city of New York you can get further quicker by Subway than anything else our automobile traffic is completely out of control chaos but we can't go on the train because we have so many homeless people living in the subway tunnels that many of whom need mental Care Mental Health Care and don't get it and on and on and on you know the realities we are here I'm a professor over the last week universities and colleges in the United States have been notifying foreign students of whom there are over one million enrolled in American colleges and universities they've been coming here to the United States for decades in huge numbers from all over the world to study and then many of them go back to their country of origin with a degree in whatever they studied here they've all been sent notices I don't know if all of them have many of them have been sent notices that are reported in the Press here the notice says you a foreign student need to consider the likelihood these are the words they use that you will have increasing difficulties with your visa and your permission to study here you may not be able to continue wow this is a country look you don't need to be a conspiracy theorist to understand that one of the crucially successful mechanisms of the American Empire over the last century was educating the bright young people that could afford to come to the United States and study those people became fluent in English if they weren't before they have you know they get married they have important moments of their lives here in the United States and many of them go back and utilize their connections here in the United States for whatever they do in their home country this created business opportunities this created alliances this created all all kinds of benefits that acred to the United States those are now going to be lost and you know where young people are increasingly already going to China to Russia to India you understand that's what it means the relationship between the data I gave you about the bricks versus the data about the G 7 everything is changing and the direction of change is unmistakable and yet in this country you will read about what the universities are doing with foreign students as if it were a sign of our putting America first that's the nicest way to say we're trying to cope with our decline but we can't say that so we're going to talk and do things like threaten Denmark about Greenland and threaten college students about the ability for them to finish the degree they invested in by coming here it's extraordinary Richard before wrapping up this session when you look at these nine countries that are going to be they're going to be by January on January 1 they're going to be bricks partners and you see Indonesia and Malaysia these two countries are in terms of their population their economy they're huge right and you see Cuba and Bolivia I am I was so happy to see Cuba in the list but what is this message coming from bricks to other countries all around the world well I think it's the oldest message that businesses give each other which is the wind is changing and the sooner you adjust I'll use the metaphor of a sailboat the sooner you adjust your sales the sooner the wind will carry you so look I don't want to overstate it either countries that join the bricks continue to do business with Britain or France or the United States no one is requiring that you shut down it's not that kind it may get there but it isn't there yet you know the United States is trying to hold on to its alliance with India and Mr Modi you know he like Mr erdogan in turkey or or any of the others they are watching which way the wind glow grows or blows you know they are trying to figure out how to navigate a changing World economy and it doesn't mean you stop everything over here and you rush over there okay it's a question of saying and by the way this is often done very explicitly because these are not politicians standing in front of a camera these are a group of businesses meeting in the office of some bank somewhere and they are saying look we need uh A1 billion dollar loan to build a road system over here we we've gone to London and New York and we we understand what they were willing to give us the terms and then we went to New Delhi and then we went to Beijing and we asked what and the bricks are giving us better term what do you want us to do we have to raise from our people in whatever country this is the taxes to pay back the loans and to pay the interest that this project is going to cost us and and we don't we don't sorry sorry we're going to have to raise the taxes from our people to pay back this loan and to pay interest on this loan that's a burden on our people and our businesses to tax them but we so it is Our obligation as political leaders to get a loan at the lowest interest rate under the best terms that's what's going on in the world every day in big conversations and little ones little company mediumsized company big company everyone sorry Deon I hope you can edit this out um every country every company is adjusting to this situation everyone is rethinking their strategy for growth where are my imports going to come from where are my exports going to be so sailable where will I borrow what kind of terms can I get what kind of investment Partnerships can I build they're asking these questions to see whether they can get a better deal they used to wonder can I get a better deal from America or maybe from Britain or maybe from I don't know the Netherlands or Germany or something in the old Cold War days they sometimes got something from Russia from the Soviet but they were always so much poorer the Soviet block was so much poorer than the West that often they didn't bother and not out of political calculation it just one was a giant with lots of money and the other one wasn't but now we have a completely different situation not like the cold war because the bricks the alternative to the West is richer than the West has more resources is willing to build because they're trying to emerge out from under the dominants of the United States so they are willing to be generous partners of countries in Asia Africa Latin America and so on and so they're all discovering options but they will for for the foreseeable future they will be open to making a deal with a western business if they can but only if it is better than the one they can get from the East and both the west and the East know that Bankers in New York get it Bankers in Beijing get it they understand they understand what this game is the only place that literally doesn't understand it is the United States because it's everywhere the signs are obvious that's why otherwise you wouldn't hear me speak this way I'm not going to say such a thing if I don't see a lot of evidence or if I would I'd say well I'm speculating I'm thinking maybe and there are things I'm not so sure about about for example I'm not so sure how how long will this take maybe there will be steps forward and then steps backward maybe the bricks will make strategic errors that allow the West longer life all of that's possible I can't foresee the future any any better than anyone else but on the other hand I'm not blind to what is already clearly underway you know when that enormous Port was opened in in Peru the port the biggest sea port I believe in Latin America certainly a brand new absolutely modern latest technology of loading ships will take the products of Latin America the southern part Peru Chile Argentina and have a direct route to Asia that's the future Asia will be buying what they what Latin America sells and vice versa and you know what neither of them will need the United States or the Panama Canal for that matter these are that's changing everything and again it's changing it in directions Peru not a member of Brit is now going to be tied to China which by the way paid for that port in Peru so of course you know this is creating combinations dependencies so I wouldn't be surprised if Peru in soon becomes an applicant for bricks membership it's The Logical next step and it's one of an immense number you know if we had Limitless time I would be going through a long list of these kinds of things uh to show you what what it means and Cuba which is having enormous economic difficulties is hoping to be rescued by its and that if it if that happens that will be another sign to many other countries in serious economic difficulty like Cuba to see in joining bricks their Best Way Forward their best chance to solve these problems that have accumulated you know it's very it's very much part of the world we live in and we are not helping matters in the United States or in Western Europe by pretending that either this isn't important or it isn't happening at all and that's what you get the majority in my Society here in the United States deny everything and then a sizable minority say no yes there's a bricks but it's not important amazing you know you never win a competition by underestimating who your competitor is and what resources the competitor has and to to deal with the bricks as if it didn't matter is unbelievably self delusional thank you so much Richard for being with us today great pleasure as always yes and my my sorrow that Michael uh who helps
