Richard when you look at these new demonstrations in the United States by students against the policy in Gaza and the reaction coming from the Democratic Party from the Republican party and these we've seen that people are comparing 2024 to 1968 and the same demonstration on the part of the students how do you see the current situation well the first thing I would say is that it reminds me of my time as a student during the war in Vietnam because the evolution of activities then is very similar at least so far with the evolution now It's a combination of perfectly reasonable logical expected Behavior by students and the ignorant hostile frightened behavior of political leaders and of University officials uh we had the same thing back then uh long effort to ignore when we were small then a frightened reaction when we became large um this is what can I tell you this is very familiar very very familiar if one were cynical one could say that the students can be excused because those who are involved now W alive back then but the administrators often were and so they have no excuse and the politicians even less so I I'm of the opinion that what we are observing is a very familiar rerun of a very old picture uh of a of a system that is having [Music] troubles and that these troubles are too difficult to talk about so they remain below the surface people talk about them but in private and with a certain fear of public we had from the time of October 7th we had the government make it crystal clear that the official position was 100% support of Israel without apparent limits without apparent hesitation without apparent conjoint policy making simply an automatic decision by an automatic Administration in Washington to automatically support an automatic Ally I mean it was all a kind of nonevent it may have appeared otherwise outside the United States but Mr Biden has been a Centrist Democrat all his life he is a senator from the state where most American corporations put their headquarters because it is considered Delaware to be the most corporate friendly State out of the 50 in the United States so what would you expect it's a little bit like being the the senator from New York or from California or from Chicago these are almost always members of The Establishment and the usual establishment means both the leaders of the Republican party and the leaders of the democratic party so it was perfectly expected that Mr um Biden would be saying what he said and that it was expected that everybody would agree with what he said starting with all the leaders of the Republican party and that's pretty much what happened even Mr Trump trying to be something different wasn't different on this subject simply repeats the same uh story but here is a difference that is important the world has changed uh it has changed very dramatically at the time of Vietnam we were still in the early stages of what could be called anti-colonialism yes after World War II India broke away from the British Empire and the other Empires began to fall apart but there were very severe battles around that I want to remind you um the Mau Rebellion which finally broke British Empire in Africa in East Africa uh didn't happen until the early 1950s um the war in Vietnam against the French likewise in the early 1950s the American overthrow of arens in Guatemala also the 1950s so that you had still at that time the early stages of people feeling as though they could talk about a global anti-colonial movement it was it wasn't even sure in the days of the bandong conference and others whether these independent politically independent regimes would survive it wasn't clear that the old Colonial Masters were not very busy trying to control the situation they certainly did control the economics of the situation in many cases and still do I mean the role of France in French West African Colonial territories is being contested right now in places like Chad and nier and the civo and those other places so I would argue that what we have now is a pretty definitive end of the colonial dominance and that changes everything I I want to remind people we now have a situation where not only are the colonies breaking away but one of them has become a superpower namely the People's Republic of China and has gathered around itself the bricks Alliance of other former Colonial powers in the main um or colonies if they weren't Colonial Powers uh and I think that the world is now adjusting to the dominance of the G7 being over finished and and a question a great question for our historical time what will the bricks and China do will they be the next Empire or will they carve out a new and different way of organizing the world economy and I don't mean to take the topic away I think these issues are directly Germaine in ways I will I will try to explain to you Germaine to the the demonstrations by the students in the United States over Palestine so let me show a little bit of that number one Israel later than everybody else tried to establish or to be more accurate Britain and Israel together tried to establish a settler colonialism long after everybody else did if you go back two or three centuries well then the the Dutch and the British and the Germans and the French and and so on they could do that they had this the global situation in which they could do it it was violent it was ugly it was exploitative and there was much resistance but they could do it Israel and Britain are trying to do it first together and now the the Israel is pretty much by themselves at a time when the world has changed when the resistance has become the governments of all of that part of the world that rejected settler colonialism that puts the Israeli effort into a completely different Global situation what often happened in in settler colonialism is now unfolding in Israel the early efforts to maybe work out a livable combination of of settlers and the indigenous people have failed many reasons long story and so the Israelis are driven by the logic of that failure to look for the other solution and the other solution is what in Germany in reference to the Jews was called the final solution to literally eliminate that part of the population the indigenous part it's what happened here in the United States we effectively eliminated the indigenous people inappropriately called Indians in the United States we we eliminated them we reduced them the mass of them were killed what remained were forced onto reservations where they could not survive very well and to this day that's where the few that remain live there they are are sicker than the rest of the population they live much shorter lives they are marginal they were only allowed to vote a few years ago I mean it it it it's the total solution we did in the United States what Netanyahu is trying to do in Gaza now but the problem is the whole world re rejects this the whole world condemns this even here in the United States Mr Biden is forced by Massive public opinion which has been a surprise to Mr Biden and a surprise to the political leadership here they had no idea of the strength of the um this is before the students of the strength of the opposition starting already in late October of last year the opposition coming out of the United States to what they were doing uh in Gaza okay so they don't want to see how the world has changed they don't want to understand what bricks recommends if you see the behavior of finance minister yelen or Secretary of State blinkin or the president in relationship to China and Bricks you will see it you will see it in Ukraine Ukraine is an example of the catastropic mistakes being made because you're not willing to look at a changed Global situation so is Palestine there was no understanding that the American people even though they are kept away from the rest of the World by a mass media that colludes with the government in this whole program but what you basically have is what psychologists call denial a denial that the American Empire fire is over that we now have to adjust to a period of decline in the United States and the G7 as the bricks and China rise now it's been true for 30 years but it was hidden and it could be ignored and now it can't be ignored so now there's an active denial we will fight the Russians and they will collapse in a week and the ruble will disappear and Russia will be broken up none of that has happened all of that was predicted confidently by every top official in the United States and most of them in Western Europe okay that was a misunderstanding of what India would do for Russia what China would do for Russia what turkey would do for Russia what Iran can do for Russia and I could go on when you make mistakes like this you ought to wonder what is your own contribution there are contributions by others but also by you what are yours cuz those are something you can change Maybe if you face it where I live in a country I was born I've lived all my life here in the United States I live in a country full of denial of all that has changed even in the face of the mistakes of you of Ukraine and now of Israel the more they are in trouble the more they hold on to what things were like in the 1950s 60s 7s and 80s that period of the ascendants of the American Empire of reaching the peak after World War II destroyed all the potential competitors Britain France Germany Italy Russia Japan all destroyed the United States already Rising in the first half of the 20th century becomes absolutely dominant and it goes to the Head it it it over it over challenges the com the mentality of what had been a secondary colony of Britain I don't mean to be historical but you need the history to understand what's going on and so Israel mounts the attack after 7 October the punishment of Hamas and of the Palestinian community that supports Hamas in Gaza and the first few days are allowed by people they suffered from the attack they have some primitive but widespread notion of allowable but week after week one side destroying literally massacring huge numbers of women and children so forth no this this violates what it violates the sense of what is appropriate in a changed world it's stronger than in Vietnam because we have now had Vietnam and we have had Afghanistan and we have been defeated by misunderstanding what we were undertaking in those places so there's more people who understand enough to say wait this is not allowable you can't do this in the world today and those people begin understandably to talk to one another to send each other emails to comment on the ferocity of what the Israelis are doing on the much larger destruction of Palestinians by Israelis than the other way around and that was always that's been true for many years but on a much smaller scale so and at first the media allow it all to be handled but then there begin to be enough media Independent Media at first foreign media who show pictures of destroyed towns and Villages and those destroyed towns and Villages are all in Gaza none of them or next to none of them are in Israel and it begins to become clear what we have and it looks a lot like an advanced industrial country Israel with the allies of Western Europe and North America and Japan physically and militarily assaulting a colonial people and suddenly the world that has slowly and unevenly adjusted to the historical change we are living through begin to realize this is offensive this is unacceptable this is outrageous and the irony that I find remarkable is that in many cases not all but in many cases here in the United States early opposition relatively muted was clear inside the Jewish community in the United States as well this was important because even though that's a small community two or 3% of the American people it would normally have been expected to support Israel because of the history of Zionism the disagreements over it but nonetheless the sense of a Jewish homeland that at least a significant part of the Jewish community supports even people who support Israel have taken strong positions publicly here in the United States against Mr Nati Netanyahu and his political allies they have together with a sizable opposition inside Israel become critics and become in that sense Pro Palestinian a a a phrase that is inaccurate denies the complexity of the different forces that are involved people people are supporting a demand for a ceasefire a de a demand for end of funding by the United States of uh Israel's military for a whole variety of reasons some of which might make sense as Pro Palestinian but others of which don't they have nothing to do with a a generalized support either of Palestine or of a one state versus two-state solution or of Hamas as an organization and so on this is an attempt very guilty Not Innocent to shape the conversation to the likes of the government here we are living in and Americans are now talking about it we are living in a major attempt by the government to silence political dis sent in this country no one should make any mistake what you see in other countries which the United States enjoys denouncing efforts to control public opinion those have always been true of the United States but they are now becoming true in very ugly ways very repressive ways of of functioning anyway I believe believe there is a displacement an upset an anger that is across the board in this country because it is difficult for all social classes to cope with a declining Empire that decline forces issues onto the table that are very divisive for example if our Empire is declining who standard of living will have to go down will the poor people have to suffer will the middle classes have to suffer will the rich have to suffer that is being fought out in the United States today and over the last 30 years just to give you an example the middle class has been the one most affected by the adjustment of an Empire that's declining and that middle class knows it and that middle class of professional people small businesses uh better pa paid workers they are very aware that they have been hurt that their situation has been damaged for those who are not Americans that's where Trump comes from he saw that not in the terms I'm explaining it but in other terms as a political opportunity to build a politics about being against immigrants to convince the destroyed middle class that the reason they're destroyed is because of immigrants which is crazy but which is very old in human history you blame the outsider the one who looks different from you who has a different skin color who speaks a different language who supports a different religion and so on we're full of that in this country we have resurrected horrible movements from the past because our people are so distressed and they don't know where to look white people decide white supremacy is something they want to support goes neatly with anti-immigrant a kind of fake patriotism a kind of celebration of an imaginary ancient America that's why Mr Trump make America great again it's it's this symbol but this is wrapped up with a generalized awareness that everything is now no longer secure so there will be Americans right now and lots of them that will want the police to go in there and beat up the students because they disagree about Palestine not at all they're angry at students they don't even know why they imagine that students come from wealthy homes many of them do and that therefore they are the privileged and now instead of working hard they're out in the street disagreeing with the government and they want to push them down they don't know why there will now be Across America over the next two months very important difficult conversations in the living rooms in the kitchens in the backyards of American families when the young people come back from college which close here in the summertime and in the next month or two they all close and then they reopen in September but they will go home and they will confront parents with whom they do not agree and there will be big changes of opinion as the young people change the mentality of the older ones and that's going to happen it happened in Vietnam it happened every time it happened in AFC africanamerican homes as a result of the black lives matter movement still going on and notice again it's the change Global situation that impacts the students who impact their parents and so the whole society has to work its way through to live its way through an adjustment to decline only the people who write newspaper editorials only the professors who stay away from those streets and only the politicians who have to keep alive the Illusions because they fear that if they were ever honest even for a minute the mass of people enraged by what's happening will blame them and by that time they will have done enough that they will deserve the blame even though they could have avoided it had they taken a different Road at the beginning had we had one leading politician not even one yet it's coming but we don't have one yet who stands up and says wait a minute this is the situation you know we're looking for we're hoping maybe Bernie Sanders will come back and do what he could have and should have done before maybe new young people will emerge I'm sure they will it will take however some time so let me conclude this I don't want to keep talking it you you should take me to where you think your audience would most like me to go but we're watching a specific event yes it's college students yes it's doing what they often do in the springtime they are concerned about an issue it is an issue that is in the newspaper every day here on radio on T it is of course reasonable normal for the students to be interested we wish in this country that the average citizen was as interested in political Affairs as our students are and they are learning and they are taking courses and they're reading they are much better informed about the issues in Gaza in the Middle East and so on than are our average citizens there's a hundred polls that show that and they have decided they want to speak freely about it they want to have meetings to discuss it they don't all agree on anything but they feel strongly that they want to be engaged if this were not a society in Decline they would be celebrated they would be applauded for their engagement we don't we have half our people don't vote in most of our elections these young people are not only voting but they are really engaged in the Civic question about War and Peace my God you know it will be understood not today because the government is hysterical in our society right now it has to stop all of this it's fearful the people at the top by the way know that the war in Ukraine is lost they just don't know what to do about it they knew the war in Afghanistan was lost but it took them years to finally withdraw no leader wanted to be the one who withdrew Biden finally did it but to show you that they learn nothing he now can't withdraw from his open-ended commitment to Netanyahu even though virtually no one else on Earth supports what Netanyahu is doing this is a very dangerous situation and now even his own people are turning against very difficult in a difficult situation and we're not talking about the sharpest knives in the drawer here our political leaders are Biden and Trump that gives you an idea in this Society the best and the brightest do not become our political leaders they go somewhere else they don't write books and they mostly don't read them either they are people of very limited capabilities and those have only been sharpened in Endless small battles between whether the Republic Republicans have the government or the Democrats and when one of them gets it the others go to work to replace them which they do and then the other ones go to work to replace them which they do in a comfortable back and forth the best sign that this is over is that a person outside of this game Mr Trump could become as powerful as he now is even though they are trying every every trick in the political Playbook to defeat him they're still not able to do it between his bumbling and fumbling and their mistakes we don't know who's going to be our next president and we have no idea where it's going to take us but here's an irony that beginning to be spread in the United States that you as an audience may enjoy Joy the strongest claim going into this presidential election that Mr Biden has against Mr Trump is that we should vote for Biden because we don't want fascism to come to which the answer that is now coming from the Trump people is too late Mr Biden has already brought it and you know everybody laughs because everybody understands exactly what is being said you do not you will not prevent fascism by voting for Biden instead of trump we used to think maybe you postpone fascism by voting for Biden instead of trump and now Mr Biden is making clear even that is not something you can say Richard when it comes to Israel and the situation that NN and his administration is making for the future of Israel we know that at the end of the day as you've mentioned the American Empire is over and that their dominance is reducing and that would hugely affect the future of Israel in that region but it doesn't seem that the netwa Administration has any sort of understanding of this issue and how important is this for the future of Israel to get in along with other countries in that region today we've learned that turkey holds all trade with Israel and they're not going to have any sort of Import and Export with Israel this is a huge change for Israel and for the future of Israel if they really if as Neto is claiming his concern is the future of the people these people who are living in Israel but it doesn't seem his actions doesn't seem to be in that direction well the Israelis have for quite a long time labored under a number of of assumptions and one of them is they can only in the end rely on themselves and that they are baged by hated by threatened by pretty much the whole world and that they have to rely on themselves and they have to rely ultimately on themselves as a military power political activists and leaders in Israel have on more than a few occasions spoken in my presence of their commitment both as individuals and as citizens of Israel that if they are threatened again they will go down but and I quote now they will take the whole world with them so that their phrase the one they like never again maybe doesn't mean what some people think it means never again Nazism or never again Holocaust and so forth with which most of the world agrees but it may mean never again we as victims which leaves open maybe again we as perpetrators we as the active cause rather than the passive victim they are surrounded by countries and people who consider them enemies and vice versa they don't accept blame for that although they deserve plenty of it so the question is what are the options available to them you know this may be painful for me to have to say but the kind of situation that leads to the extermination of other communities to you know these terrible words of destroying whole ethnicities of one kind or another they are usually the fruit of people and communities that feel they have no choice who see the world as if they have no choice the Israelis now see the world that way or at least the Netanyahu type Israelis it's not all of them of course but that group sizable portion of Israeli Society believe as best I can tell that they will either be destroyed or they must destroy they don't see any other options anymore and I want to make people understand however you want to dismiss that however you want to dis discredit or criticize that perspective which I do it's also important to understand it it'll make your criticism more effective the Germans the Germans believed that the suffering of the German people an unbearable suffering and here I'm going to do a little history with you again because it's crucial the Germans believed their suffering had been caused and perpetrated by the Jews in the world this is an old anti-semitic idea is exists in Europe for a long time before there were Nazis so they they didn't invent this they picked it up and developed it what were the real sufferings that they blamed on the Jews let's go through it Germany was the upand cominging competitor of Great Britain to replace the British Empire with a German Empire the only other competitor in the second half of the 19th century to the rise of Germany as Britain's great competitor was the United States and the Germans expected to inherit the British Empire to be the great replacement you can't understand the second half of the 19th century with the rise of German history especially uh their politics their unification of many small countries into one large Germany the achievement of their leader Otto von bismar uh and all that that represented they had hopes of being the great intellectual cultural uh military power of Europe rep a German Empire in German German is my first language that was destroyed in World War I their leader the Kaiser abdicate it was the end of the Empire literally the end of their leader the end of their power their colonies which were numerous were taken away from them as part of the settlement of World War One an immense reparations bill was imposed on Germany by The Victors of World War I particularly France and Britain with the approval of the United States Germany was destroyed first in war and then in peace there was no way they could recover from the boom they had achieved in the second half of the 19th century the boom that they were in the middle of when they lost the war and then the reparations meant they couldn't recover from the war War because they had to deliver wealth from Germany to the Victorious countries France and England so bad were the conditions that in 1923 Germany goes through another catastrophe for those who don't know the history we had one of the worst inflations in human history in Germany in 1923 and five 3 and 4 in or 22 and 23 in that in a period of a year and a half German families among the most frugal in the world who had saved over generations deutschmark and put them aside in a bank account or in a box I know these things because I'm talking about my own family they were wiped out 25 years of sa Savings in a week became the amount of money you needed to buy a quar pound of butter they were gone their savings what they hoped to rely on through the difficulties of a Lost World War and the reparations were taken from them and then in 1929 four years later the global World depression begins October 1929 and the German economy is smashed again well if you put any any population through that many catastrophes World War I ends in 1918 and the Great Depression hits them in 1929 that's 10 years of a lost world war of a reparations bill of the worst inflation in modern history and the worst depression capitalism had ever seen it was too much you know how we know it was too much because in 1932 and three the German people turned as their to their new leader Adolf Hitler so it isn't surprising and it should not Shock anyone to learn that in the in that crazy time they would also find meaning in Hitler's idea borrowed from the past that the Jews were the ones who had made all this happen so the Germans were taught to explain all of their suffering as the the behavior of Jews who could and who would do it to them again this trained the German people to see it's either us or them you have to have that me mentality to then deliberately take the property away from the Jews take their jobs away from their Jews take their homes away from their Jews stick them in a jail stick them in a concentration camp and then finally mass murder them what we are watching and don't miss the historical irony is the Jews at least that part of them that became zionists and went to Palestine finding themselves in the same situation under new conditions Germans are no longer relevant it's Palace iians they're going to take us over they are going to expel us they are going to try to kill us and we have no choice to get rid of them is what we have to do yeah at first just Hamas but Hamas is the organization supported and sustained by Palestinians probably more so now than ever and so they're stuck you know what ended it in Germany with the Jews outside intervention the war when Russia and the United States together stopped the German system from continuing something outside probably has to intervene in Israel and Palestine or else they are going to kill each other and I'm being euphemistic because the the Palestinians don't have the means any more than the Jews had the means in Germany one side has the means both sides have the fear we know the result we're watching it that's why what is happening there and that's why the rest of the world including college students in the United States who don't see the world this way they never went through this suffering they don't understand and our government does nothing to teach there is no program in this country teaching the history of Germany and the Jews to help contextualize and explain what is happening and without an understand standing any intervention is hit or miss and the interventions of Mr Biden are mostly about him getting reelected he neither knows nor understands there's nobody in the administration who even speaks about what is going on here with some understanding so we have the peculiar situation not only of taking a position to question our government here but we have to do the work and maybe people like us always have to we have to do the work of teaching and explaining all that has to be understood to begin to find a way out of this since the people in charge Mr our president Mr Netanyahu clearly have no solution have no offer of a solution are busy doing what they have always done without recognizing that catastrophe that is producing if I can get that across I think people will have a different way of thinking about this we are now going to go into a whole new process in this country the issue isn't going to be Palestine Israel the issue is going to be students versus government students and faculty versus administrators and that too is a long old history that will be very powerful in shaping the politics of this country now forever because they don't know the people who run this country let me assure you I come from the universities where they were my classmates as I believe I've mentioned to you on this program Janet Yellen and I were students together at the same University at the same time were taught by the same professors I know exactly what she does and vice versa I know these people they have no idea what's going on they don't have the beginning of an inside they have a a sense of running a well oil capitalist machine the kind they grew up in the kind that taught them the kind that rewarded them and the kind they want to hold on to and they don't know why it isn't working there's even a tragedy in them
