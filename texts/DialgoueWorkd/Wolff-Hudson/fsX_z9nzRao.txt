hi everybody today's Thursday October 24th 2024 and we're having Richard Wolff and Michael Hudson with us to talk about the brick Summit in kazon let's start with Michael Michael what was important about this Summit well it was important not for coming up with Solutions but just to lay out what the table of contents is going to be for the problems that they're going uh to work on uh this is really the first time they've got together and what's important is how many of the people were there uh when you had uh the bandom conference in Indonesia 80 years ago uh there was a general idea that the US centered order wasn't a good way of working but uh Cuba uh Indonesia the other uh they call them third world countries r or non-aligned countries at the time didn't have any ability to actually put in an alternative order because there weren't enough of them uh none of them were self-sufficient uh and now what makes this different is that uh there are enough leading countries in the bricks led by China and Russia to actually enable them to be uh self uh self-sufficient and to be able to say we really don't need the West if need be if there has to be a break we can at least uh trade with each other have financing with each other and even extend military protection to each other well the real question is what are they going to do uh with this power uh and how can you get all these different countries to sometime somehow agree on what to do well you could see that one uh Center of this was finance and especially President Putin in his introductory marks showed all of this uh they've already protected themselves by having their own alternative to Swift and their Bank clearing uh they they were able to announce they're going to trade in their own National currencies but that's not really putting in together a new system they all want to dollarize but obviously they're going to continue uh to uh work uh with the dollar is uh in all of their trade with the Western countries so the real question is what are they going to do they're still talking about working within the framework of the western institutions they thought within the uh World Trade Organization but what can you do there there hasn't been a decision by the World Trade Organization Court in three years because the United States has refused to appoint uh a judge that would make a quorum so nothing they can do what can they do within the IMF the only statements that came out of the meeting were that the global South countries want some of themselves to be uh increasing their quotas within the IMF but the real problem isn't that the real problem is the whole operating philosophy in uh of the IMF based on austerity theories and uh uh the subordination to a us- centered order uh so all they I think uh the that Putin and China uh and the other uh leaders who were there just said well all we can do is say uh we we we would like to work within these organizations but that has hasn't worked by the time the next meeting comes around so I think all this meeting really was aimed at was to set up the agenda for the second meeting and that's really the important thing and uh the key reform uh uh uh that that they wanted uh was how to how to avoid the bricks being treated in the same way that Russia was treated and I think in President Putin's uh comments this was his his holding Focus saying we are the West's Rush rehearsal for what it's going to do to you or to any other country that tries to uh take its own self-determination into its own hands the us is going to treat you as an enemy so I think that Putin's U introductory statements were all about that uh he he he pointed out that a a a sort of Shadow uh alternative to the Western organizations were necessary but uh all he could do was say here are the problems that we have to be be sold and the he did at the very beginning zero win on the fact that chronic growth of the debt burden uh to in developed countries continues well the question is they they now have a whole uh year to dis discuss what are we going to do if uh we cannot afford to increase our growth if we have to keep paying the dollar debt to our bond holders uh I think Putin was trying to set the stage he also said quote establish the bricks arbitration investment center to develop a convention on the settlement of investment disputes which will increase the security well what he's really saying is this is an alternative to what President Obama did with a transpacific partnership the International Investment dispute center under the current rules of countries that uh join uh this uh this agreement if a country uh raises taxes on a US company uh it has to pay damages equal to the amount of taxes that it raises if it uh imposes oses penalties for pollution caused by an oil company or a mining company uh and says you have to pay this uh the mining company or oil company can go to court and say you have to give all that money back to us because you're not allowed to make any change in the status quo that we've uh imposed under us rules uh in effect you cannot have any progress or any sovereignty for yourself in controlling your tax system your legal system or your y system so I think that when uh Putin raised the point that I made all he was doing was setting the stage for arguments that are going to be taking place over over the coming year uh I think most of the uh reports that you've seen uh hardly any in America but you've seen on the internet are sort of celebratory oh look we're independent and I don't think they uh that they want to be a spoil Sport and say this is really only uh the first the first stage I only want to say one more a few more quotes of Putin uh and then I'll turn it over to Richard uh Putin said we don't fight the dollar but if we are not allowed to work with it what to do then we're forced to look for other Alternatives uh and I think that that is that's setting the stage for the fact that uh we're not attacking the West the West is attacking all of us starting with uh Russia and pretty soon China and uh all we can do is respond he's trying to uh convince them uh of the need that you that uh uh You' better join I think what the pr will call the hardliners uh China and Russia the most immediately affected uh States and the problem of course is that many of the bricks members want to have a a foot in both camps uh turkey wants to go both ways Saudi Arabia wants to go both ways uh India wants to uh keep all of the US markets and the US investment and join Brit so all all that uh President Putin and the other member the discussions could bring out is there's a a great tension right now between uh uh the West the NATO countries and the bricks and this whole this whole uh repertoire of problems that they site are really an agenda for what they're going to have to negotiate with to actually come out with a policy response and uh next year or the year after that or the year after that Richard okay um let me add something to what um Michael is saying as I follow these things I too was struck by the sheer historic significance of all of those people from all of those countries getting together and working on what is in effect a new world order my suspicion is that historians will look back on this meeting and the next one a little bit like they look back on Bret woods and and all those big meetings at the end of World War II that tried to set up quote unquote the architecture of modern Global Finance modern global economy uh and therefore very very very important just the spectacle of SE serious collaboration um serious conversation about key issues and plans to work on them some more does that mean that it'll all happen smoothly of course not I there's no way to know that uh Michael mentions some of the pressures on them for example the the debts of many countries in the global South uh debts that are where the creditors are in the global North and and all of the implications that that has um but I would also begin to talk a little bit about more contradictions than those for example um there are enormous differences within the bricks no one should have the illusion that because they can get together because they were friendly to one another which they were and because that's significant which it is that doesn't mean there aren't also big differences among them right now those don't seem to be overwhelming them but history suggests they might and so I'm a little I'm a little concerned less wishful thinking amongst us about what can happen now takes us beyond what can happen to what will happen and and I just want us to be a little careful the second contradiction is to recognize that the G7 is also in deep trouble internally regardless of what happens with the global South for example really for the first time couple of years ago Bond holders were unwilling to continue to fund the deficits of Great Britain and the Prime Minister granted an idiot but that's not unique to her uh didn't understand it went right ahead and proposed what people told her she couldn't do she was sure she could do it and she went ahead and did it and and she's she's out of there they throw away Mr MRA is now heading right down that that same path Bond holders have told the French that they are not going to continue to fund their national debt is now over well over 100% of their GDP publicly held [Music] um but there's a huge difference because in France the largest faction in the parliament are socialists I want to remind everyone that the leading group of deputies is the new United front a coalition of the French socialist French communist french green and the biggest one it's called La France Anum which means France unbowed those four together have the largest block of seats in the parliament Marron cannot move politically the way he wants and so the way the financial press and by the way the Press today when it begins to recognize the the US and British press what's going on in France has got the usual I'll be I'll be polite interpretation the honest statement GR tesque propaganda here's how it works Bond holders are telling the French you have to reign in spending no that's not correct the bond holders are saying you have to stop running deficits and as every undergraduate knows the way you would reign in deficits could be to cut spending but there is an alternative it's called taxing and it's called taxing corporations and the rich because the others don't have any more to tax you've done all you can go but there is this need to discuss the finances of the state as if taxing corporations and the rich Were Somehow off the table somehow not part of the mix somehow not not only not doable but not discussible it can't be put on the T nothing you get an enormous Applause if you do something minuscule that will never raise enough money to deal with the deficit so you're going to raise tax on the rich by a percentage kamla Harris's proposal to raise on people earning over $400,000 by a little bit you know what in the world are you talking about these are the you ERS of magnitude are being played with here by hoping that the audience doesn't understand but here's the real problem you've been spending your way and it's now for this whole Century basically the 21st century starting with the.com crash in the spring of 2000 capitalist economies in the west have been subsidizing economic growth as far as they can listening to Michael will enjoy this listening to the modern monetary Theory as a license to go ahead and basically print the money as you need it and I don't mean to demean mmt they made an important contribution they taught people what they should have understood anyway but in any case there's a problem here if you keep on doing that then you are going since you haven't come to producing government money yet yet directly you still go through the the charade of issuing bonds and selling those to your monetary Authority and allowing the monetary authority to print the money with which it buys the bonds that the government released this this game designed to protect governments from Simply printing money at will has now run its course we now have too much debt and it turns out that the government like the American government is facing the next few years where it will have to spend as much on servicing its debt as it is on defense and that's that doesn't leave very much for everybody else and everybody else is saying uh oh no no no no no and now the bond holder gets worried because one way to resolve this would be to stop paying the bond holders and that of course must never be so you've got two absurdities you can't stop paying the bond holders when of course you can and you can't tax corporations and the rich when of course you can and I won't bore you by giving you examples of bond holders who haven't been paid in the last 20 years there's loads of them there's loads of them and taxes on corporations and the rich well what was the new deal if not an extraordinary Act of taxing corporations and the rich relative to what you had done before I understand there was a lot of other things going on but I think we are reaching a point in which these contradictions have accumulated we got them between North and South we've got them within the South we've got them within the north you don't have to be a heg to or a Marxist to understand that these accumulating contradictions are very profound very large and very fundamental they would take more Ingenuity than any government I see to deal with any one of them but to deal with the cumulative impact as each worsens the other I would conclude that what the bricks conference brings to the four is that we are in for some very tumultuous times right now and the last thing I would say that for me it gives another framework to understanding what's going on in the biggest picture and I would very briefly here's what I think it is the the United States's Global position keeps slipping it keeps slipping if you count you know the percentage of Central Bank Reserves held in dollars well it's slipping it's not zero the dollar is still important but not what it was 20 30 years ago no way clear the United States lost the military war in Vietnam it lost the military war in Afghanistan it is losing or has lost in Iraq and it is losing in Ukraine Hollow that's a sign of an Empire slipping it can't do then it made a colossal mistake it remember with me February and March of 2022 Russia invades Ukraine and from the president of the United States and the prime minister of England and so forth Russia will regret this the ruble will collapse the Russians will be on their knees the whole Russian totality will break up into small Mr Putin will be run out of office now they all said that because they believed it they did not understand the options Russia had like the bricks they could sell their own oil and gas to India and China they could cut a whole raft of deals with the 30 other countries that have expressed interests greater or lesser in joining bricks etc etc they didn't count on that they're be they're making terrible mistakes the isolation that this means for them they haven't understood that their program of isolating Russia is so far mostly successful in isolating the United States and then Israel comes along and underscores the same point only perhaps more so these are signs of a declining Empire overreaching because it acts as though it were the 1960s and70s as though it were the only country to emerge economically speaking intact out of World War II with all the potential competitors wiped out it can't let go and so you have this conclusion if Michael and I are right that the new economic world order that is now emerging is among the most important Shapers of the economic future of everybody how that plays out China Russia Brazil but also the G7 then what do you make of a country like ours at the high point of a presidential election in which neither candidate says anything about any of it I mean it is extra this is called deny but on the scale of an Empire an Empire denying its own decline therefore making catastrophic mistakes whose effect is to deepen the decline wow we are in trouble well Richard you made two uh separate points and I want to deal with them in sequence you're absolutely right that the key of struggle in every one of the brics countries is being over the tax issue uh the tax issue did not come up in a single uh chapter of the long long bricks uh summary nobody uh brought it up you talked about uh this being an internal contradiction what they've said is what contradiction we're not even going to uh discuss it and I think the reason they didn't discuss it is there was uh not any agreement at all because they uh so many of uh China's and uh other countries uh economic students have been trained in the United States and the tax issue isn't part of their education they are I think we've dealt with this before in our discussions uh the the 19th century classical economics was all about what to tax unearned income Asos to earned income none of that is appeared in any of the discussions I tried to introduce it to Russia in the 1990s and uh early 2000s uh couldn't get through the the kleptocracy there same thing in China uh I I uh they really are not open to that uh but this is uh the the the problem that's uh lying I think the uh purpose of this meeting was only to deal with with a relations geopolitical relations between the bricks countries uh among them uh with each other uh not with uh General uh economic uh Theory uh and but certainly if we're talking about financial reform this has to be the financial reform the only strong statement that I could find in all of the brick summaries was uh the 10 chapter 10 and it's two sentences uh so I'll read it because I think that U opens the path to potentially dealing what you're talking about it says we are deeply concerned about the disruptive effect of unlawful unilateral coercive measures including illegal sanctions on the world economy international trade and the achievement of the sustainable development goals such measures undermine the UN Charter the multilateral trading system the sustainable development and environmental agreements they also negatively impact economic growth energy health and food security exacerbating poverty and environmental changes well that's their strongest throwing down uh uh The Gauntlet and you can say that in answering these questions they're opening up uh what you and I would love uh to be the whole class war issue that has taken a financial form that all of the growth in the United States and many other countries has been uh in the financial sector the wealthiest 10% not in the rest of the 99% um and then you talk about military support and that uh they did mention quite a bit of that and they mentioned the near East and it's very interesting uh to see uh how they dealt with this they talked about Russia and China at least part partially supporting Iran but China seems to try to straddle the brecks the the bricks and its relations with the United States it's as if it downplays uh the constant us threats that China is suffering from the United States saying China is our uh strategic enemy uh long term and we're going to have to go to war with it in a few years China seems to be completely ignoring that well obviously uh the uh us NATO attack on Russia uh is planned to be extended to the Pacific and it's going to affect all of the uh they talked quite a they U quite a few chapters were focused on uh Israel and the surprising thing is that the Arab and the other Islamic countries are not protesting Palestinian uh uh or Israel uh the Israeli genocide uh and this leaves them prone to Israel in the United States proceeding with the neocon plan to take over Syria and Iraq along with the Arab oil producers including Saudi Arabia uh two weeks ago as you know president Netanyahu s uh uh held up a map of Greater Israel and said we are going to take over Saudi Arabia we're going to take over the the Arab uh U uh the oil republics we're going to take over part of uh part of Egypt we're going to take uh over the oil and of course uh Syria and Iraq not a word of this apparently the syrians uh the Saudi Arab Arabians say well okay uh we're going to support we're going to let Israel take us all over what we want to do is uh keep for the ruling family we want to take the trillion dollars or so in the National sodi Fund and we want to take them all with us to the United States and we get to have all this money we'll give Israel all of the oil over there that seems to be the uh the uh Arab opposition and all this and the only country that's opposing it is a non-arab country Iran none of that uh really came uh out and the amazing thing is uh in all of this discussion uh that you had on Military Affairs in these U uh the the meetings uh all of this was just again plowed right under uh the fact that yes they deploy or the fact that they're genocide but we're not going to do anything about it we're just going to be for ourselves and uh try to at least uh uh if if we're driven out of our country at least we're going to take all the money with us and that's uh the question is is there any intention of actually expanding the Shanghai cooperation organization into a bricks counterpart of NATO and how serious will these obligations be for support if you can't even get the Arab countries to defend themselves uh and their oil why on Earth would they want to defend any other country that's being attacked uh the uh this is talk about internal contradictions this is an one geoeconomic geopolitical uh internal uh contradictions uh they did point to the uh uh the fact that there was no rule of law uh militarily or economic there's no way of really talking to cope with uh uh the West's illegal sanctions against bricks uh there's no talking about well maybe we can get our own uh sanctions program against the west and if the West says we're going to sanction you then uh the bricks countries can say well uh no more uh Rare Earth exports or gallium or germanium from China no more uh refined aluminum from China Russia can say no more uh of the uh our exports to the West not only oil and gas but all sorts of raw materials uh and even military goods that the West wants so uh all of these you've pointed to the time bombs uh in uh that are there in the brics meetings and uh I I they are internal they're not internal contradictions they just didn't the for them uh there are questions that should be avoided rather than saying how are we going to deal with these U the fact that there's a a difference in uh position all they're doing so far is saying what can we agree on because this is our first meeting so they're not going to get into uh What uh is it going to be really difficult to get them to agree on and you'd think that the one thing that would enable them to find something to agree on that they should have done is exactly the point you made the tax system what if what if they tax raw materials rent and land rent of the oil companies and the mining companies there what if they tax Monopoly rent or have an anti-monopoly position on the uh privatized Public Utilities that the IMF has forced Global South countries to sell off in order to raise the money to pay their foreign bond holders uh what are they going how are they going to solve these problems and uh nothing nothing along these lines uh I think has been uh thought that uh if they introduced them uh there would be a kind of dissension all they wanted was a kind of Kumbaya what what uh core can we agree on without without really talking to the problems so I guess our you're in my role is to say here are the problems that you're going to have to deal with Richard yes my my guess is that they that they know those problems I think it's quite clear that the Chinese are under No Illusion that the United States has uh at least at this point any intention of working out uh Live and Let Live the the Chinese complain bitterly all the time that their attempt to get A Place in the Sun is interpreted in the United States as an assault on the United States so that they cannot they can't do anything that has a negative impact on the United States without that negative impact being interpreted in the United States as the motive rather than the UN unfortunate or unwanted side effect I me very hard to get people together to have a negotiation if they insist on such Frameworks for understanding what one another are doing which anyone who has tried to get a negotiation going excuse me knows and these people do that for a living they know better I think the CH I think they all know and I'm I'm I'm not privy to anything but here's my guess as to what's going on nobody wants to be on the receiving end of an Israeli military attack supported by the United States with money and and weaponry this is a heavy price to pay and the Israelis have now functioned either knowingly or clumsily I don't know they're like the the the person in your neighborhood Who behaves badly and you try to do something about it and then you realize that they really are crazy that you're not dealing with somebody with whom you can say look don't do that and I'll do this and that'll help you and and we'll work something out you you can't because they are responding to a higher power literally a Biblical injunction to recapture the real estate that they lost years ago right and for them this is now a holy war and you know where that takes people and what they're willing to do and what kinds of bargaining you can or cannot make with them and I think whether you're an Arab country or not you're not really interested in becoming another Lebanon you you don't want to be in that situation you can't defend against that you don't have the means and right now the United States and its European allies seem ready to support an Israel and by the way that role could be played by others too it's not unique doesn't have to be Israel but for the moment it is Israel um for the moment the United States will fund it and weaponize it and the Israelis will mortgage their own future I mean look what must be happening to their economy this is a country that is obviously willing to become a dependent of the United States for an indefinite future when this war is over how are they ever going to rebuild and I'm even talking about militarily and diplomatically just you know whatever will be left of the Israel infrastructure and so on it's it's extraordinary and I don't think I think they understand it perfectly well but they're not ready yet to deal with it they're not look let me give you a parallel the Russians believed if you listen to them I find it hard that they say this but they say it they believed a guarantee back in 1990 that NATO would not move East that the Euro Eastern European countries that regained their full political independence with the collapse of the of the of the Soviet Union and so on that NATO would not go east okay NATO went East step by step country by country from the Baltic states in the north to Bulgaria Romania in the South and everything in between you know in many ways Ukraine was the last certainly the last big step but in the last step uh each time the Russians made the decision not to push back a little bit in Georgia I I know the history but basically it was only when the when the oth red line was crossed which was basically the the move to integrate Ukraine into NATO and the EU that they've but you know that was partly waiting until they were strong enough and as they have shown and here I'm referring to the military story what the Russians have shown is that they were able to develop a missile capacity far better than anybody else far larger than anybody I'm including United States there's no one understood what they had and could use all right this is the model I think that's what's go I think that's what's going on in China right now and so here's where I think this goes I brought up the internal contradiction because I think the likely challenge is going to actually happen in the West in the in Europe first and then in the United States Europe is weaker um it's going to be unable to utilize monetary and fiscal policy in the manner that they have you know since K's taught them how to do it right they can't lower the interest rates you know they were already flirting with negative interest rates and with all the uncontrolled consequences of that and they've loaded up on on on expansionary fiscal policy which is why they have these crazy deficits and the accumulated national debt which the bond hold since they have integrated that system of M of money into their world so they're stuck and they're going to be confronted with a moment of truth they're going to have to Plate these Bond holders or overthrow them and since those Bond holders are them they're not going to overthrow themselves they are then going to confront what I suspect a split which is what I the way I understand the 1930s Roosevelt went in One Direction he went ironically even though he was a child of the of the Hoy pooy the aristocracy of the United States the Roosevelt family of the Hudson River Valley blah blah blah he went with the unions and the Socialists and the Communists and gave them Social Security unemployment compensation a minimum wage 15 million Public Employee he gave them the Socialist program and all he asked in return was that they vote for him which they did and they reelected him three times but by far the most successful president the country had there will be another one of those and on the other hand will be all the people that have been in charge since then whose job it was to roll back the New Deal and they will now be confronted what are you going to do and the the latter group is going to want to really collapse the American standard of living and if they can make the right alliance with the with Trump or people like that if they can bring together the Christian fundamentalists and the white supremacists and the people who need 12 guns in the back of their truck okay they might pull that off for a while but they're going to confront an enormous part of the population that will understand that their entire life is at stake here and they are going to make noise and that's going to be another civil war in one form or another and I think that's where the out of that will come a recognition in Europe and the United States that The Jig Is up and that they have to come to turn with the New World Order they'll think of it as coming to terms with Russia and the bricks and China but it will be coming out of how they come to terms with their own internal dead end that their policies have led them LED them into well the question is uh whether uh if they solve these internal problems whether they're going to still try to have the old uh predatory uh economics in uh the the bricks countries in the 19th century uh Britain had uh all sorts of ideas about have how to have a thriving popular industrial economy they were going to tax the landlords they were going to keep uh finance and real estate all isolated uh but when these uh the British uh wealthy fi financiers and investors went to uh third world countri countries to the Ottoman Empire or to Latin America for railroads utilities the Panama Canal and the SE Canal they were all of a sudden that's where they supported the rent seeking and the grabbing so you uh the this internal contradiction that you rightly point to the United States is going to uh affect uh the the bricks as well and I all I can think of is that the bricks countries will will watch this Str within the United States uh and England today's Financial Times had a large their biggest report was on the commercial real estate crisis that uh so many of the biggest buildings in um the city the financial city of London had debt in excess of the value of the building so uh here you can what are you going to do to uh buy uh the biggest skyscraper uh in London if uh it has 467 thou million dollar uh in debt and uh they're trying to get 500 uh million for it but nobody nobody's uh going to bid for that same thing in America uh commercial real estate is is broken well the banks hold the mortgages on these and if the real the defaults are soaring for commercial real estate in uh London England and America just as they are in China so we're having a worldwide problem and the question is are you going to bail out the banks and if you uh uh don't bail out the banks uh what's going to happen to their largest depositors the the uninsured depositors of the rich people are we going to save them this is this is the problem that's going to occur uh already is occurring uh in China uh and it's going to occur in other brick countries so you know when you you look at the the bricks meetings what uh you talked about at the beginning quite correctly is uh we would like to hope that future historians will look back on these meetings in Kazan as the first step to creating an alternative civilization because we're really talking about a civilization break from the west and by civilization I mean uh the tax system the debt relations the monetary relations the military defense systems the political systems uh all of these uh in order to avoid the contradictions that you and I have been discussing for decades now uh they're going to have to uh create an alternative and this is a gigantic job obviously it couldn't be uh solved at one meeting or I don't think even by next year uh meeting they can't but uh they what is needed is a Consciousness that they are trying to create a new basis for a non-western non- us-dominated non- unipolar civilization and uh that uh the recognition that this cannot be achieved with h a friendly relations with the West that the West will not accept it and the West will try to have a fifth column of non-government organizations such have uh have been uh recently banned in in the state of Georgia the country of Georgia uh they realize that the US has a whole fifth column of a a managerial class uh that would like to take over along the same lines that have enriched it so well as you've described in uh in America and Europe well obviously the strains of supporting the military budget uh and the uh the Cold War and the US sanctions against Russia are going to be felt first of all in Europe so I think you're quite right the already you you have uh the strains pulling uh the German economy the French economy uh the Austrian economy all apart and what are the vested interests going to do there well they're going to do uh what they did in Germany they will ban these uh parties like they're trying to ban the alternative for deuts land they'll ban the leftwing parties they'll ban the reformist parties saying these are uh uh agents of Putin agents of China agents of the bricks it was it's the West that will treat any attempt to be uh to reform economies as being an attack on the west itself and by uh if the West permits the bricks to create uh a solution to these tensions if they permit the bricks to have a rational tax system a progressive tax system as you and I want to say then America will say we're not really fighting China or Russia we're fighting a different economic system and the geopolitical war we're seeing isn't among countries it's between one system or another you can call it one civilization or another or one kind of economy uh or another uh but uh this is this is the civilizational uh up the ante uh that there has to be I I didn't see any of that in the brics meeting because that would be uh if that would frighten a lot of countries and I think that Russia China and the other leaders of the bricks right now are trying to avoid frightening these countries but uh implicitly these uh economic strains or contradictions that you point out have to be leading in this direction uh and these what you describe as the domestic strains in in France uh in Europe uh in America we had under Roosevelt all of these will be reflected on the geopolitical level uh and the bested interests have a two-fold fight not only fighting against the reform reformers who don't want to give all the money to the bond holders and the banks the Ry a Ry a class uh but they're fighting against the ability of bricks countries to say it doesn't have to be this way we can do our own way uh uh different and if you want to uh follow our model and reform your economies and prevent the impoverishment and the economic polarization that your financial class and your bond holding class and banking class and real estate class are C causing then uh either join the bricks or emulat us this is what is the nightmare to the United States is not yet a nightmare to the bricks countries in their vested interests but you're you're quite right it's a a nightmare mostly within the West because uh that is where they have to they're much more aware of the class war here than they seem to be aware of in other countries uh that don't have a background in uh studying flash War uh in in the way the way that we have uh but everything that they're talking about restructuring International instit stions is exactly uh setting the stage for for this dual conflict within the West within the bricks and between the west and the bricks yeah let me give two final you know I know where time is our enemy here but some dimensions of this to to get this a little clearer um first China was acceptable to the west from the 1970s say to 2010 or 15 why because it provided Western capitalism with an enormous subsidy Limitless cheap labor all kinds of government supports and access to the largest fastest growing Market in the world an incredible boost a bigger boost for Western capitalism than anything any of its own governments could have or did do now that China more than anybody but also to some extent India and Brazil and but mostly China took advantage of that situation no question and develop veloped a hybrid 5050 split half private capitalist Enterprise brought in to capture technology and markets and half state-owned and operated Enterprise to give the Communist party and the government extraordinary leverage which other governments do not have in the west and they put this hybrid to work producing a fast rate of economic growth than the world has ever seen and that anybody in the G7 ever came close to 30 years of 6 to 9% increase GDP per year far faster than anybody else in the west okay now that China did that they want to shut China down you've done what we wanted you to stop stop don't flood our market with the results don't outcompete Us in the world with the results we're not going to that's not what we we wanted to make money off you we did the stock market boom from 1980 to to 2010 is all about that all about re cycling the money the profits that were made by exporting the jobs okay but now this happy Arrangement has come to an end and the United States is outraged so is the rest of Europe they're outraged that this is developing in a way that their own textbooks should have told them now that's a good chance that's going to happen because you know what it's like in in certain ways the United States coming out of a Britain as an Empire peace and so the Chinese are determined but they've realized and I think this is very important I think the Chinese learned a lesson you were able to get unbelievable growth but you took a risk you did it by welcoming capitalist Enterprise and becoming the export market for the world which means that the rest of the world can hurt you by shutting down its export markets and you are vulnerable which is the problem of the Chinese econom now it's still growing faster than the United States a lot faster but much slower than it did this year according to the IMF uh China growth 4.8% that's a really low number for them it's very good relative to the US's number this year which is 2.8% but the the bottom line is the Chinese are now in a multi-year program to develop an internal market and they're tempted to see the bricks as the expansion of their internal Market that frees them from the hostility of the United States and Europe that's a reasonable strategy for them to pursue and I think it will go a long way for China to be the blue to hold that all together to make accommodations to pay for this to keep stroking the West we're not your enemy we're not your enemy because they're not confronting notice when when the Tariff on on China is now the greatest producer of electric vehicles the byd corporation has won the competition it's the best car it's the cheapest uh electric car the United States in response Biden raised the Tariff from 27% to 100% a $3,000 byd car costs an American 60,000 which is why there are none of them on the road Europe only ATT tax taxes them a tariff less than half of the United States and therefore you will find on European roads right now lots of byd vehicles okay this this is a very careful thing what did the Chinese do well they put a few tariffs on a few things they're small in number they're small in significance they're they're symbolic when the Europeans U the tax on their cars which they did a few weeks ago their response was to up the Tariff on cognac this is symbolic this isn't real they they are willing to be the nice guy they are willing to make the cost of these tariff moves against them relatively small they could have made them much larger they are holding back but here comes the punchline if the whole rest of the world can buy the best electric car and truck for half what the American competitor will have to pay that's the end of American competition if an American makes I don't know a box like this and ships it to Europe but has to pay way more for the truck that brings the paper and the truck that brings the paint that makes the to blah blah then the price of the American product reflecting the input cost of vehicles will be uncompetitive look it's the flip side of why Germany was the engine of Europe because it got cheap Russian energy so Germany was successful now the Energy's cut off you know what Germany's GDP this year is negative it couldn't even get to zero it's minus it's drawing it's pulling Europe down you know it's extraordinary these issues are coming up in very Stark confrontations they're going to be American companies and they're already doing it by the way here in the United State the Chamber of Commerce is against all of this tariff policy they're against Trump's tariff they're against Biden tavs the United States doesn't admit its Empire is over so it doesn't have to make concessions but the businessmen who are losing their money they want to make concessions and they're going to to substitute politicians who work it out for politicians who are tough guys they're the ones that going to make that happen whatever the left in the United States does and I don't mean that they're irrelevant they're not but whatever the left does these things are happening in the ruling class they've got these problems that they have very little chance at this point to resolve because they are still lost in the crazy notion that they have an Empire to protect they don't they have the decline of an Empire to manage that's different and they have to they have to at some point uh deal with that the IMF released the over the last two or three weeks the rates of growth for the year 2024 among the G7 the fastest is the United States at 2.8% all all of the others are less and in the case of Germany negative here are the uh 2024 rates of growth of the IMF for the bricks South Africa 0.9% so that's low but notice it's positive Russia excuse me Brazil 2.8% that's the same as the US Russia 3.9% China 4.8% India 7% there is no contest here the bricks are running away as we speak with economic growth there's only a certain amount of time left before the disparity which is already there the total G aggregate GDP of the bricks is larger than that of the G7 and becoming larger every minute the impact of that that's what we're really that's what everybody's struggling with and when you take a mountain of debt accumulated in the west that's losing this struggle you have a recipe for Extraordinary difficulty coming down the pike and there I'm afraid it doesn't much matter for that whether you vote for Trump or uh Harris I mean there are other reasons why you can vote for one or the other I I understand that Michael that's it I agree this I think we Spilled Out the tensions at work okay you're gonna leave us Michael right now yeah yeah I have to leave okay we we're gonna continue I have some questions for Rachel thank you all right Michael Michael we will miss you yeah Richard you you've mentioned at the beginning of this talk you mentioned that there are some differences between these countries and we totally understand when it comes to Russia China India especially Iran Saudi Arabia but we've learned that in this meeting in this Summit China and Russia were formalizing to put an end to that Conflict at their border and it's huge the way that they're trying to manage the situation it seems to me that they came they have come to a solution for the Border problem and right now Saudi Arabia and Iran are talking about a joint Naval drills in in the Red Sea these countries you look at the picture and at this Summit you Venezuela Iran Saudi Arabia it's colorful Richard it's unbelievable when you look at the picture and you on the other hand you look at G7 seven count and in your opinion these you you've mentioned these problems but it seems that they're getting to the point that they totally understand to put aside their differences to make compromise and cooperation which is so crucial for the future of bricks yeah well here you know to explain this and to articulate it it's difficult here in the United States because of the way these issues are normally either not discussed at all or discussed in highly ideologically tilted ways so having said that let me try anyway um it's easier to bring countries together if there are two conditions that are met one if they share a common enemy and number two if they share a common attractive future if you can show them that there's a future that would be good for all of them then you can bring them together and if you could show them that there's a future with less Danger from their enemy that another reason for them and I think what we now have is that situation that countries as different as Iran and Saudi Arabia or Egypt and Brazil or however you want to look at it that they are increasingly persuaded and this is a big picture but that's what's in the minds of these leaders well else do they have they are persuaded by the economic growth of China especially but of these numbers I've given you they're all aware of what these numbers suggest they're part of bricks that's growing well and they're not part of the G7 that's not growing well I mean there is no way around this and this has been true for years it's not not a one year or a twoe or a five year or even a 10 year it's decades long this Divergence so they are persuaded that working together they're on the right side and while China is very careful it is still the giant among them it is the giant pulling all of them up directly or indirectly and so they can be a leader without having to be autarchic or autocratic about their leadership now compare the United States the United States is losing that's why it's important they lost the war in Vietnam a small weak Communist Party party in power in the northern half of the country which had been separated from the southern half was able to fight another civil war defeat the South and expel the United States in 1975 look by itself it didn't change anything but as people began to see that now the communist party was in charge and that now Vietnam's Economic Development took off it's one of the most prosperous growing countries in the world right now so it not only broke the control of France as the colonial power but it showed what can be done if you have that kind of this is this is extremely important being defeated in Afghanistan so that the Taliban resumes being the power in the country defeats and expels the United States even after 911 and the blowing up the the buildings here in New York this is very symbolically Rich it it stimulates and inspires millions of people around the world to think differently and that has effects in what they write in what they say in how they function how they vote the United States is declining and in its decline it is making huge mistakes supporting Ukraine the way it has is a mistake the Russians are defeating the ukrainians which should have been the presumption anyway Russia's a big country Ukraine is a little one Russia has many more people than Ukraine Russia is milit I mean come on and yes you the West could give them weapons which it did but that's not enough which any and I'm no military expert but uh whoa that's not a complex idea and now they're supporting Israel completely isolated in the whole world there's no no one supports Israel whatever they say no one the mass of people don't not even in the United States which is funding the whole business I can tell you I'm sitting here in New York City we have more demonstrations for Palestinians in our streets than we do for Israelis even though we have a large Jewish population and a quite small Arabic or Muslim Muslim population so the United States appears to be dangerous hostile and losing well I can see people backing away Michael said before he left or I think maybe you said it that there are a number of countries that are trying to to play both to to keep some kind of relationship with the bricks but also with the EU the G7 yes of course India Saudi Arabia yeah yeah of but of come on everybody understands that right you don't want to pay a price you'd like to get the benefit of both and now you have the chance but that's historically unprecedented for the last 75 years if you needed help if you needed support you went to London or Washington or Paris now you can go to those places but you can also go to Beijing and you go to New Delhi and oh we have options so of course we will ask one and then tell the other and hope the other gives us more than the one yeah that's part that will happen of course that will happen but the direction is unmistakable one side is losing the position it had and the other side is gaining the position it didn't have before and with countries getting a big loan for a railroad or a big loan to improve your health system or investment by chinese company they understand what's going on their local businesses that make money from this they understand what's going on they may have gotten educated in England but they understand that the future of their company is in deals in China where they go and make those deals so you you what you're watching almost like a film in slow motion is a shift as every country in the world and every multinational business is trying to navigate how do we act and you better be careful the Americans want you to join with them you can't do you explain to the I've been at these meetings where the foreign businessman is explaining to the the banker in New York of course I'm going to take a loan from the Chinese Bank what do you think I am crazy if I only take a loan from you I can't cut a deal in China I need to buy iron I need to sell and if I borrow from a Chinese Bank all of that is easier every country is every company is adjusting and they don't want the United States to get in the way if it doesn't cost them they're patriotic but when it costs them they're not because they know that that government will not save them if they're making no money and the bottom line is profit that's how capitalism works so you can let your neocons do that you can let your your crazy Trump president tariff tariff tariff you know what you're half hoping hoping that what those tariffs did is not work and you know who was glad to see that they didn't work American businesses they understood sure the car companies knew that if you allow byd it will become the car company of this country the way Toyota and Nissan displaced General Motors and Ford we know how that works we and that's what the Chinese are going to do and if it takes laws allowing them to move and develop factories here they will do that too and you know what happens when you let the Chinese build a factory in Alabama the governor of Alabama stops talking against the Chinese because he can't risk it for his that's what's happening and while the neocons are doing all their flag waving that evening they will be in difficulty at a dinner party in Washington with three big businessman attack them for what they're doing we don't don't want a war in Taiwan we don't care about Taiwan we've got 50,000 workers who will be laid off if the Chinese stop buying what we're producing stop talking like that you're hurting our business and if you hurt us anymore we're going to get rid of you and replace you with somebody who won't hurt us we won't give you $2 million for the next election will'll find whoever is running against you and offer it to them that's how this works and it works so long as there's no other political movement and that's why we have what we have normally the the people who control Financial policy are the same old same all who only Trump arriving why because of the internal people don't get it that's an internal contradiction for 40 years Republican and Democratic governments facilitated the relocation of us jobs out of the United States to China they were manufacturing jobs that were the most unionized and the most highest paid so you took millions of American families and you yanked them out of an economic situation that was successful for them that's the beginning of trump all he does is come along and say hey this is terrible this is awful and if you vote for me I will make America great again I will bring back what was taken from you that job and the big businessmen will support a trump if it gets them subsidies and tax cuts which he represents but when he does his tariffs no he will say to them I need that to win the election you want me to give you a tax cut you've got to let me say that no they say to him we don't have to we can get a trump who does what we like who's different from you because they won't do what we don't like and if you force us that's what we'll do and that's will shape American po it's what's shaping it now it's the it's the contradiction of what globalization did to the American working class has now come back to shut down the globalization or to try to how successful they'll be not yet clear not yet clear at all before wrapping up Richard recently we had a very important decision on the part of the Biden Administration they have decided not to send long range missiles to Ukraine in order to hit deep into Russia if you remember that meeting between Stormer and Joe Biden it seems that Pentagon Pentagon was running the show they have decided not to send those missiles to Ukraine right now with these new tensions between Iran and Israel I don't know if you heard about the leak documents somebody in the Biden Administration in Pentagon decided to put these documents out in order to avoid a bigger conflict between Iran and Israel which could lead to a to involvement of the United States into a big war with the United States in the Middle East again after Afghanistan Iraq again and we know how important is Iran the position they're having the the troubles they're the the problems they're having with houthis in the Red Sea they couldn't manage the problem with houthis houthis just blocked everything in the Red Sea right now the if something big happens between the United States and Iran in the Middle East would be devastating for the world economy what's going on every corner of this world I think that's one of the reasons that these people in Washington have decided to put out these documents but how do you see overall how do you see the way that Neto is trying desperately to drag the United States into the conflict into a bigger War into a bigger conflict with Iran right now Israelis the N Administration was not successful in gas right now in the southern part of Lebanon he wants to fight each and everybody in that region right now with Iran it seems that it's his final goal his main goal is to drag the United States into the conflict in in the Middle East your take yes I mean I understand that's a perfectly logical inference from what he's doing uh whatever you think of Israel it is a relatively small country surrounded by hostile neighbors some of which are small but some of which like Iran are much larger uh this is a dead end and to fight in that situation is difficult to fight on several fronts Gaza West Bank Lebanon Iran I mean that's crazy you you you are assembling your enemies and you're not getting any bigger they are becoming more nuas your enemies so you better get a friend and the only conceit able nobody else is anywhere near doing this they're all alone so they have the United States and not surprisingly the United States is very the leadership is split there are those who want to do it because they have grandiose ideas of reorganizing the Middle East with Israel a huge country that simply swallows up all the others a bizarre way of thinking but look it was bizarre to put Israel in the middle of the Middle East anyway you know so this way of thinking is not dead this kind of colonial mentality settlers um but I think the Israelis know that they're asking the United States to take an enormous risk for them and they don't want I don't think it's going to happen to tell you the truth I could be wrong but I don't think it's going to happen I don't think it's only the Pentagon either I'm not surprised the Pentagon understands better than anybody what the military capability of Russia is and the United States has not fought a serious military enemy for a very long time you know United States versus Taliban or Vietnamese I mean there's a war machine and and and peasants with guns you know it's amazing that they won anyway but you know now you're dealing with a country that has with stod Napoleon World War I World War II and now this and each time defeated the enemy you really want you really want this for what you throw bombs into the interior of Russia what do you think think that's going to do make the Russians stop what they I mean this is crazy that would make no sense that they would do that so that will provoke them and then you have the risk they will send now missiles deep into Europe or here to the United States and then we'll be confronted with the next stage of this escalation which ends with the nuclear war which everybody kind of understands is ridiculous so you but if you don't go there then why are you taking the intermediate steps when it's clear that they will react we now know that if you keep pushing the Russians at a certain point they push back that's what the war in Ukraine is you push them some more we know they're going to push back and no one can understand what the Chinese will do they have an alliance with Russia they will be weakened if Russia is destroyed they know that too they have an enormous interest in not letting that happen do you really really for the Ukraine no this is not about the Ukraine it's not much about Israel either this is about what do you do when your Empire is shrinking when when history is not on your side anymore when time is not on your side anymore when each year passes makes you a little weaker and them a little stronger and there's no end in sight for this you don't have what the United States used to have the edge in technology the Chinese have done the same with techn they're ahead in telephones in you know in we love Apple here in this country apple and and Amazon and yeah but the Chinese have the equivalent they can do that they've done it better than we have in half a dozen Tech of these Technologies already anyway like the electric car so we don't have that we don't have they have India and China together have you know eight times the population of the United States you know it begins to look like Russia and Ukraine India China and the US and allies that are small by comparison and whose people do not want any of this because unlike Americans they know the last century had two world wars fought in Europe none were fought in the United States that too is an enormously important part of all of this you can you can't work your way out unless you work your way out you have to sit down and come to an agreement this is what we we can let you the Chinese do this this and this and you must let us do this this and this and then we're okay we can live we can grow that can be done especially in an era when just rapid economic growth is is no longer the ultimate goal because we understand climate change we understand limited uh resources at least until we go to other planets etc etc you have the basis of shared understanding um work on it do it the alternative is is literally Unthinkable and that's why we have last Point another clue is that we're watching things that are outside of the acceptable human behavior and we wonder about it we wonder how do the Israelis keep mowing down women and children in schools and hospitals in Gaza Israeli people are not monsters what what it what's going on they must be desperate they must be crazy what they are doing why aren't the young men being TR go there and shoot this school and then you have the limp oh Hamas uses the school that's very old old military always excuse what they do on the grounds that they're just doing what they should but everybody everybody knows what the outcome is if there's civilians you don't go there you have to find another way that's how you behave in a civilized manner they're not doing that they're not doing that the Russians are bombing Ukraine but not the hospitals not the schools not the women and children are are some dying for sure are those the responsibility of the Russians yes have there been war crimes committed I'm sure there have I'm sure on both sides Ditto in Israel but there's a policy going on in Israel that is extraordinary and by the way the policy of Hamas to kill all those innocent civilian people that's a war crime too for the same reason but you can you can understand why the Hamas resists even if you do not agree or accept war crimes you can understand Israel wants security to exist but that doesn't excuse war crimes those are two different things and they can stand together and insist they're the same doesn't make them the same it makes you complicit at the end of World War II a huge number of Nazis were executed because they did this kind of thing and when they said I only did it because I was ordered to do it and the people who gave the orders said we had intelligence that said that make it they were executed anyway it made that was not an acceptable you know if your officer tells you to kill women and children you say I can't do it and if you don't okay well that's a choice you made and now we will see what happens to you you know yeah I don't mean I don't mean to be harsh or unfair but I'm trying to to understand I still believe that the only hope for the Israelis is not being military that's a dead end for me self-destructive for them but is to work out a way to live together with the Arab population Nima I have to get this so okay thank you so much say goodbye okay thank you bye bye byebye
