so nice to have you back Michael on this podcast we're waiting for Richard to join us and let's get started with the debate between Donald Trump and camalo Harris what's your understanding of the outcome of the foreign policy of the United States when it comes to the economic war between the United States and China well I don't think there was any outcome at all uh the question is were obviously uh supporters of the democratic party and uh they wanted to make it all about personality uh and they mostly Trump's personality and they kept trying to Goat him uh on well how many people at your rallies uh Etc and when Trump would try to raise an economic issue like are you better off today than you were four years ago under my Administration Camala would merely say well a member of the middle class you know and I'm all for the middle class and she'd go into a stump speech but that's not about policy uh they very carefully avoided talking about policy and it's it's obvious that if you're supporting the reelection of Biden and Trump and the Democrats how on Earth can you permit economic policy to be discussed without uh exp explaining and acknowledging why Americans are in a worse econom IC position today they and it's not simply because of inflation ABC questioners kept trying to say well inflation is down why are people complaining well they're complaining because they can't afford to live uh without going deeper into debt and they can't afford to buy housing e e even to rent without going really further into debt and if they buy a house uh Mortgage Debt uh these are sort of taboo uh subjects and whenever Trump would try to uh get into uh something like that they would uh divert the issue from him so they they weren't really able to uh say very much uh uh Trump didn't say well if you're middle class then when you were Attorney General of California uh why didn't you help the Hispanic and the black homeowners uh that were being evicted by Mr minuchin uh for his vast mortgage fraud when all of the other people uh lawyers were pressing you to do something about it well Trump couldn't say that because then he appointed Mr minuchin is his own treasury secretary so there's a kind of compact between uh both the Republicans and the Democrats not to acknowledge the actual economic policies uh that are going the uh questioners tried to go Trump into talking about the war in Ukraine and they kept saying do you want Ukraine to lose to to Putin uh more of the Putin derangement uh syndrome that they kept doing he didn't fall for that he just said well you know I want peace there has to be a peace agreement uh that he that was the closest they came to anything that's uh economic he didn't point out to about the cost of the military industrial complex he didn't talk about all the money that Biden uh and his son have gotten from Ukraine so there really wasn't much of a foreign policy uh debate at all except to wave the flag of nationalism Michael how did you find the the policy toward Gaza and what's going on in Gaza did you see any sort of difference between what Camala was saying and what Trump was pointing out wait the the policy towards where poliy toward Israel and Palestine neither of them could uh well both of them uh reive so much money from uh the Zionist Lobby from APAC that nobody's going to uh make any criticism at all but I was uh amazed at how Kamala was just saying you were absolutely behind Israel uh it has a right to defend itself and the fact is it's killed so many Palestinians uh just assassinated them that it's afraid they're going to fight back and because it's hurt them so much of course it's afraid they'll fight back so we have to let them bomb them all because as long as there are any Palestinians left they're going to be very resentful and that's a threat to Israel uh I think she lost the Palestinian vote of Michigan and uh Minnesota with that extreme statement Richard welcome yes my apologies thank you I got stuck in the New York City subway system that's what I told him I said new New York is not very good on maintaining internet access uh uh to people to the extent that more developed countries are able to do yes exactly Richard we were talking about the debate between Donald Trump and Camala Harris and how what was your take on their foreign policy when it comes to both case in Ukraine and in Israel well Mr Trump gave you basically nothing uh except to tell you over and over again that he would have done a wonderful job the level of discourse of that debate tells you something about a society that has lost all connection to its ostensible political processes I mean are we really talking about the the problems of the society and the solutions or at least the directions of the solutions we're looking for I don't think so you know it's not just the the lunacy you know the the Haitian immigrant eating pets or or the other really crazy stuff it the sadness is in in what was not dealt with I mean let me try to give you an example that that that really did strike me we are living through and you you know we've all all three of us have discussed this separately and together we are living through a reorganization of the world economy in a major way the dominant nearly monopolistic position of the United States for most of the last century is over and there's another player in the game and that player has caught up or is in the process of catching up and Sur surpassing the United States in high-tech and other areas the bricks is already a larger economic formation than the G7 um the United States's Global position is radically changing and we're in the middle of it and the direction is now quite clear and the outcome pretty clear too maybe not so quickly I mean there'll be surprises but there is a big change and what is the position of the United States are we for example as a nation going to try in every way to hold back the Chinese as we had you know as the tariffs are designed to do and the the the provocations around Taiwan and is that what we're going to do are we going to arrest the Huawei Executives family and Canada and you on and on and on or are we going to sit down and work out some some way to share this planet to figure out how to be respective ecologically which we kind of know we have to and respective of one another's Frameworks of functioning and that will open up the whole question of the Monroe Doctrine here in the I mean look this stuff is already happening the question is what is the position of the United States is it going to accommodate the decline of the American Empire is it gonna fight tooth and nail is it what and what does the Republican Party propose and what does a Democratic party propose for me that'd be the first question that is the dominant question within which Taiwan or Israel or Ukraine are particulars are specifics are symptoms what's your position on the the whole thing how do you nothing for me I'm waiting I get nothing that you know this is what my friends of mine these days are calling a nothing Burger you know when you open the two pieces of bread there's nothing inside because you know in a poor country you you you eat the the simulacrum of food because you can't afford the food those are very disappointing for me not surprising but still somewhat disappointing I had hoped I didn't hope for much from him I had hoped a little bit of some sort of suggestion I felt that she most ly lined up um as a junior member of the the the Biden team whatever that means uh there was no hint that she would be different from the sort of neocons that they have at the top of their agenda I keep hearing rumors that the next secretary of state if she wins is Mr Jake Sullivan he's the same person who's doing all this stuff now so look I do understand that what happens in her Administration if she wins or in his administration if he wins will be more determined by outside events and whatever happens inside this country than by anything they say or do anyway so on the partly this is all you know play acting but Hollywood Theater but even given all of that I found the material on on on foreign policy unbelievable I mean just you're spending a Fortune of money you're risking unbelievable and we don't discuss it it's is extraordinary Michael well there's a reason Richard points out that uh what should be discussed are the reasons for the American uh Decline and what to do about it but of course it can't be discussed because America's decline is a result of the policies that the Democrats and the Republicans are following uh and uh how can they uh explain and discuss these policies without uh the obvious question is well aren't these leading to de-industrialization and a decline and a shift of the uh world uh uh towards East Asia yeah I the way I would put it is they can't discuss it because they can't admit what the problem is in the first place it sort of it reminds me of the rule of a Alcoholics Anonymous that before you attend a meeting or before you speak at a meeting if I have this right you have to admit that you have a problem that your alcoholism brings you now to this community to try to overcome it and that's a noble thing and you've made a first step but you kind of have to take ownership of that first step in order to go through the reds or you would have to admit that the and we don't have that we have a we want our government to be cheerleaders they are raah raah raw for what we have we have a problem here and there and I'm going to fix it but that's it we are all we are all boosters you know the word capitalism never appears it's as if we don't have a particular economic system and that it's as if nothing about that system as a system is a problem I mean that's extraordinary you know you could you could fudge around that you could say look they don't want they don't there should be no discussion so when when critics of America make a joke that we have two pro capitalist parties end of story that's correct we have two major parties who on the question of the basic economic system have no criticism no comment nothing leads back to that system you know what that is that's a hysterical refusal even to ask a question even to admit there might be something in this capitalist system some dimension of the profit maximization rule in investment or something else about the uniqueness of this system the very fact that in every workplace a tiny group of people make all the decisions what to produce how to produce where to produce what to do with the profit that that structure irrelevant how do know maybe that's on neeman's show instead of on ABC I mean you know it's an extraordinary hysteria it doesn't show up as yelling and screaming although we are getting there but it's more the the the community of people who without knowing it without saying a word understand the taboo you know it's it's like in certain communities you can't say a word about sex or you can't say a word about religion you you know the taboo topics that don't have to be discussed because there's the agreement of everyone never to bring it up it's ex and the hysteria of it I mean the only time you got close the only time was when Mr Trump calls her a Marxist and refers to her Marxist father and you could see in the room and I thought she handled that really quite well I I I was impressed she rolled her eyes Twisted her head smiled and brushed it off and so did everybody else you know it it it was an inappropriate side comment that nobody was at their slightest bit interested in you know and I'm glad I mean I know where that would have gone had they been interested I'm not it's not I don't regret this I enjoyed it to tell you the truth but it was also a sign it is out of bounds it is you know it as if one of the two of them had started taking their clothes off not conceivable it will not happen yeah and getting to the point Michael and the question right now is what would be the solution coming out of these two candidates right now it seems that Trump is suggesting more tariff and his only solution would be more tariffs on whatever country that are not considering dollar as their as the currency of trade and how do you find it right now is Donald Trump capable of convincing these countries by tariffs uh well the Biden Administration is already uh convinced it's not just Trump talking about tariffs this is the uh one response that the Biden and Harris Administration has uh already Congress has passed the law as of January 5th 2025 uh us tariffs are set to be doubled or more uh at least to 25% to 50% for many Chinese Imports uh including semiconductors and solar cells and needles and syringes just uh uh they've been doubled from 25% to 50% rates that's get pretty close uh and the US is planning already a 100% tariff on Chinese made El electronic vehicles uh so they've uh all Trump is doing is going along uh with this uh already set uh US policy uh the 100% tariff on vehicles is supposed to be going into effect on August 1st but it's been delayed and uh time to allow for some kind of uh public review I guess because they don't want any fight back before the election but a candidate doesn't have an election in November and just last week uh they've already announced they're going to impose 100% tariff on China made electronic Vehicles effective October 1st uh as well as 25% tariffs on aluminum uh and steel from that well what Trump has been talking about most of all is steel and it's worth talking about this because uh I think this is one of the reasons why is why America is going down uh it's amazing how American foreign policy is so self-destructive and and why is this uh it's as if us strategists imagine that uh when they're going to impose a new belligerent uh economic or military policy such as the Tariff other countries are not going to respond uh they're going to be just accept what the US is doing just like Germany has done when the US destroyed uh uh the nordstream pipeline that was giving it uh the gas to make its U its chemicals and fertilizers and fuel its steel industry so let's see what what China can do uh when America uh imposes these these tariffs it it's not going to complain to the world Trade Organization what it's been doing because uh the World Trade Organization has been paralyzed for the last few years by the United States refusing to supply uh one of the referees and there's not a quorum uh to make a a decision so uh the China uh even though it believes it would win some kind of damage from the United States uh by the World Trade Organization it realizes that's a US organization and it's a kangaroo court so let's be imaginative I think we talked before a little bit about what the us could do um if uh the US imposes a a 100% tariff on on vehicles or or steel China can re retaliate with let's call it triple damages it could charge a 300% export fee on sales of uh aluminum uh germanium gallium Rare Earth uh and these things that America uh needs or simply say uh we can't continue this trade under these conditions because 100% tariff would mean that the entire value of the Chinese exports to the United States the entire value amount would be paid to the US Treasury to finance uh the military uh department and uh in the military's encirclement of China and other East Asian countries so the more Chinese uh companies exported to the United States the more the United States would have to militarily uh surround China and these countries to try to destroy their economies uh that was one that's one thing that they could do they could just say we're we're fed up with the system uh like I think already countries around the world are fed up with them uh it could simply uh stop it but there's an even worse problem and this is something that has been going on the anti- steel Terror the steel tariffs have been going on for a long time I think 10 years ago already I discussed with u Lori Wallock on Democracy Now uh in 2018 why it's wrong to have steel tariffs the American protectionists in the 19th century the American School of political economy developed the whole logic of protectionism and how uh to use protectionism to make America industrially stronger and the basic theory was uh you you don't want to export raw materials you want to import raw materials and you want to work them up into finished manufacturers because that's where the value added is that's where the technology is that's where the high wage labor is uh so America's strategy like that of Britain should uh be to convince other countries you produce the raw materials uh send them to us to work out and uh you will benefit from uh the comparative cost theory that David Ricardo thought up and is still the basis of American Theory everybody gains by a division of labor uh especially uh if it's the division of labor between raw material supporters and uh uh industrialists and uh IND industrial producers and that's because uh in America uh by raising the price of steel you raise the costs to every industry that's using steel for its more sophisticated products uh machiner is made out of steel all kinds of Machines are made out of steel just about every uh large value added key product is made uh airplanes out of steel and uh why on Earth would you want to increase the cost of Steel as an input that's going to make products made out of steel less competitive in World Markets uh I think Trump's attempt to say I'm going to try to get the labor union vote of uh the steel industry by U raising tariffs uh and that may help me get elected but it's the most uh anti-industrial policy that you can imagine and it's not uh it's not simply an anti-china policy it's an anti- jaapan policy uh already you've seen in the last week uh the Biden Administration saying he will uh absolutely block uh nipon steel from uh trying to buy out the sort of rundown uh us Steel company uh nepon steel had promised to modernize it to make it competitive again to invest uh $15 billion dollar in upgrading the production facilities of uh us steel uh and there's oppos there's one American company that's opposing this and that's Cleveland Cliffs and it says wait a minute we can make money for our steel uh industry and for its employ uh it's true that we cannot invest to make steel more cheaply but uh if we can merge with us steel then we'll have a monopoly and if we can have a monopoly we can charge enough money to uh have control the US steel Market even though it's high cost uh and uh the B Administration says wow high cost steel means higher wages higher wages for steel workers means the union will vote uh Democratic if I can do it before Trump does it and uh that will help us uh uh win the election against the other guy who wants to uh uh prevent foreign investment and steel so both parties are absolutely committed to raising the price of raw materials uh making us squeezing uh industrial producers out of World Markets uh that's what I mean by a self-destructive uh policy uh and nobody has been uh able able to raise this um as Richard says uh it's not something that they want raised because uh of course uh their self-serving electoral policy is uh very damaging to American industry but American foreign policy uh does not really take account of the effects and the counter effects uh that are going to happen on us industry Nima let me expand a little bit on on that because it is so important uh first much of the conversation about tariffs at least for the last almost 10 years since they became a a a central feature of Mr Trump who seems to have discovered them a little bit like a a child discovers a toy in the sandbox uh he's he can throw tariffs and so forth and he doesn't seem to understand as many econom have noted he keeps saying that the Tariff is paid for by China it isn't the Tariff is paid for by the American importer who brings it in a tariff by the way and and folks should enjoy this because it's a way of amplifying enriching what Michael just said a tariff is a tax the Republicans are the party against taxes and their entire economic program is raising taxes they happen to call these taxes tariffs in an earlier day these things were called import duties that's the same word tariff is an import Duty it is paid by the commercial entity usually a business that brings goods or services produced outside the United States for sale inside the United States anybody who does that has to pay for the product to be brought to the United States from wherever it's produced that has to be paid for you pay the producer of the French wine in France or the Japanese Electronics in Japan or the Fillin the blank and then if there's a tariff you have to pay that to Uncle Sam right so now let's use the example of the electric car made in China 15 years ago every major automobile company began a competitive race to produce an electric vehicle 15 years later it's very clear who won the winner is called the byd Corp operation which is Chinese not Tesla not Elon Musk byd and you've probably not heard of it and you don't know the name of the chairperson and it doesn't matter okay if they produce a First Rate car the best one at the lowest price which they do and let's just say for Simplicity it cost $30,000 it means that they will now now try to sell their top-of-the-line cheapest version best quality electric car and truck which indeed they're doing all over the world a quarter of the electric cars on the road in Europe and there are many are byd you can go to Europe now and you'll be in one before you know it now here comes Michael's very important point any American company producing anything you know Underpants suppose an American company in Cincinnati makes Underpants but it needs trucks to bring the material in and to take the product out and it's going to be buying electric trucks sooner or later it can't buy the $3,000 vehicle at 30,000 from China because it's got a ter on it if they want to buy it they have to pay 30,000 for the truck plus another 30,000 that's what 100% tariff means 100% again another 30 go to Uncle Sam which means what they are at a competitive disadvantage to every other Underpants producer in the world who can buy the Chinese vehicles at 30 grand the American can't he would have to pay 60 but don't worry says Mr Elon Musk I have a friend in the White House I get a tariff and so I can sell you the Tesla truck at $55,000 and you'll be happy you're getting it at all and so you'll pay 55 all your competitors around the world will pay 30 $30,000 for the same truck that lasts the same time you know what that does that destroys the market for the United they can't compete their costs are too high what will happen to Americans is the same thing that's happening in Europe because they can't get cheap energy we can't get cheap Chinese Goods if you didn't want this to happen you would have had to stop Chinese devel velopment 35 years ago it's too late that's not available anymore but nothing of a nothing of this is discussed not last night not in the Press it's just I'm going to throw tariffs I'm an economic historian there's something called the infant industry argument it's an old argument of people who have studied this question and it goes like like this if you want to develop a new industry if they're just babies new Industries developing and they're surrounded by tough competitors well maybe a tariff for a little bit you can catch up you can get a get enough production going that even in your little market you can get up to speed and then you can compete but it's understood to be a shortterm policy under particular conditions for a while it would make sense if you don't understand that that's when you get the situation we have now we're not an infant industry we are a dying industry we're at the other end of that life cycle of Industries there's not an appropriate policy especially if you once were the Empire Center here's the joke that makes capture it these policies are justified by saying something about isolating China what they are actually doing is isolating the United States we are cutting ourselves off Michael just touches the tip of the iceberg of retaliation the rest of the world keeps hoping this is a phase that the US will not stay with the longer that doesn't appear to be the case the more it looks like the Democrats have bought into basically doing it again the way Michael quite correctly says Biden continued Trump's tariffs most of them the more the rest of the world realizes this has been a basic change and now they're going to consider how best to respond we may think that you Europe is all settled it isn't right below the surface we have an European politics that have been lined up behind the United States for half a century these people all all of them you know maon uh the whole Tor regime unfortunately a good part of the labor party also in England Schulz in Germany and so these are people people whose whole careers have been supporting the United States protected by the United they're part of the United States but right below the surface is a vast class of of Germans of French people of British people of Italian people who don't want what's going on who the biggest single topic for discussion in Europe now that I encounter is around the topic called deindustrialization that's the anxiety there that they are being dropped between the two colossuses China and the bricks on the one hand and the United States G7 all of that on the other hand and that for they are the sacrificial lamb that the way war will be avoided between the two polls is sharing the booty of a dis integrating Europe and they don't want that because they know where that leaves them they don't want that and they're going to make a a a problem you can already see it you can see it in the rise of the far right which takes advantage of the working class dilemma around this but you can also see it in the shift of masses of Voters again I want to remind people a few weeks ago in the elections in France out of the three major parties the party of the sitting president came in third out of three he's done he's not president maon he's president macaroon it's finished he's a joke what happened four left-wing parties got together formed the unified party called the new popular front and they are the biggest party in the in the in the French Parliament they are a party composed ready because my American audience gu I love this of the French Socialist Party the French Communist Party the french green party and the biggest of them something called la andum which in trans Ates roughly into France unbowed which is the party of Jean luk melon who unlike Kamala Harris is a Marxist and always was and he's the you know he's the biggest successful politician in the country as I'm speaking things are changing but listening to that debate last night you wouldn't have a clue Michael do you want to add something to what Richard said or I can well we can uh it's not only the European uh population that's talking about de-industrialization uh it it's uh the leadership uh we spoke before about Mario dragi who just came out with a report report right yeah for the European Union commission saying 800 billion euros to promote industrial investment in the hope that somehow uh that will help pull uh uh Europe uh to make it a real rival between America and uh China well how can an American colony try to be a rival of America if the leadership is all on the US payroll that sort of is uh uh is a fantasy but the the problem is where where is this 800 billion going to go uh suppose that you were to uh Buy uh use 800 billion billion euros uh to build all brand new chemical companies all brand new steel making companies or you know whatever industry you're going to get uh who would operates them how would they uh who would invest and uh pay uh for a company that has to pay uh four or five times as much for its gas uh as the Americans or Chinese have to uh much more for its oil much more for uh any kind of uh input uh that the United States wants to shank sanction against uh Russia or China uh the there's no way that Europe can cope with the the corner that it's painted into and that's why uh as Richard just said the two anti-war anti the two parties opposing the anti- Ria a war in Ukraine and the cold war came out uh way on top in last week's elections in Turing and U Saxony well the uh re German response is that uh the leading part party uh that won in Tia the alternative for deuts land uh is a terrorist party well who are they terrorizing they're terrorizing Jake Sullivan they're terrorizing Mr blinkin they're terrorizing the mil US military and the neocons because uh if the rest of the Europeans have all been listening to your show and what you and Richard and I have been saying they realize that they cannot not only uh be be a rival again but even be a a a a joiner a third a third uh wheel uh on all of this uh uh as long as they have to join the US sanctions and Cold War and realiz and as the head of NATO just said we're an Asian power we're an Asian power now we belong in the North China Sea to defend uh Europe uh oh and you heard camela say uh last night again uh if we don't that she just went uh to meet with uh uh the zalinski and she she told the American people if we don't support zinski there America is going to walk right through Poland presumably on its way to Germany to re to re make uh the uh the old Deutch East German Republic and to remake the old Soviet Union imagining that any country can uh today uh Russia or anyone can field a mil a army that can actually invade a country that's fighting back uh and not be totally uh annihilated this idea that Russia is the threat uh camela is say really is said I'm a super Hillary Clinton I'm it's all Russia Russia Russia and I I thought you know why are they doing all this La uh last night in in the debate and it's because right now Mr blinkin and uh I think uh us generals are meeting just today Wednesday in Ukraine with Mr zalinski to try to uh figure out some way either of winding down uh the the war and shifting attention and uh walking away from Ukraine just like America decided it was in its interest to walk away from Afghanistan what do you do if all of a sudden your whole Administration since uh 2022 has been uh based on uh or fighting against Russia as The Invader well what do you do if all of a sudden oh you've lost the NATO uh arms haven't worked they've all been blown up uh by by the Russians and uh the there have been almost a million uh ukrainians uh either killed or wounded and much of the Ukrainian skilled population is all left the country uh trying to find jobs elsewhere Ukraine's finished as a result of the United States as an object lesson for all the countries in Asia in Africa in Latin America that this is what happens if you uh fight on behalf of the United States well uh I won't say that uh Germany is going to fight to the last German but are they willing to be unemployed to the last German are the FR and Italians going to be willing to be unemployed you know to the last people that really is what it is the United States has gobbled them up uh and uh what what on Earth can they do for the industry uh they're they're trying to claim well the uh decline in GDP has not been all that serious gu but uh what's more important uh the the GDP or uh uh uh employment and actual industry well uh you can you can see where all of this is is leading the something has to give uh and the problem is that uh Europe has basically uh abolished uh political Freedom they want to abolish the parties that are opposing uh the US C War uh and this is what is polarizing the whole European population President Putin has announced already you know it would be very nice if uh uh if Europe stops trying to fight us and stops providing bombs uh uh for Ukraine to attack us but it's going to be another generation before we can trust Europe again and they would have to demonstrate their independence from the United States uh but just uh like APAC has a great influence on uh the US election the US uh National Endowment for democracy is the APAC of of Europe that's finding founding all of the uh non-governmental organizations that are trying to overthrow the governments there that's why Georgia uh the Republic has just uh tried to ban uh non-governmental organizations uh of All Sorts there because it realizes these are us agents of influence they're trying to create a narrative uh that other countries have to depend on us leadership and it's either us or them and if we don't support the United States then uh we won't end up being a democracy like the Ukraine or uh Israel you know the two uh primary American democracies uh uh that they're supporting well you can see where all of this is leading at think I want to pick up on something Michael said since that's how we we we're going this notion that you did hear from kamla Harris yesterday about if you don't stop the Russians in Ukraine well then they will be marching across Europe or whatever the ex actual words were that she used and I I want people to think a minute in the war in Vietnam that's now 30 plus 40 years ago the argument was made over and over again why are Americans going 10,000 miles about as far as you can go from the United States before you start coming back to the United States given that the Earth is round I'm only speaking for those people who see that the Earth is round not the the flat ones um why are we sending our you know hundreds of thousands of troops and billions of dollars and er over to Vietnam and the answer given by that generation was if we don't Prevail in Vietnam well then the Communist that was the label for our enemy in those days they will march across ye Asia and there will be no end over and over again did the United States Prevail in Vietnam no 1975 that war came to an end when the United States was defeated and left Saigon in a hurry with people hanging on to the bottoms of helicopters as they left the country for the last time all right we've had 30 to 40 years where is the demonstrated movement of the Communists of North Vietnam or any Communists taking over any country in Asia answer nothing none of it none of it happened none of it took place every prediction was wrong are we going to Simply pretend that none of that happened but before you answer let me give you the next why are we in Afghanistan we were told many years later well we can't allow the Taliban because if the Taliban were to win the next thing you know the Taliban would be everywhere and uh radical Islam would destabilize all of the the Taliban won the US is gone where's the big Islamic takeover nothing how many times is the world both America Europe or any place else going to believe this kind of an argu this is the argument which any elementary school psychologist will tell you it's called projection it's when something you are trying to do which you cannot admit becomes explicit by projecting it as the objective of the other person in the environment you know who's trying to hold on it's the United States all of these are subtractions from us control Vietnam stopped being what it had been didto for [Music] Afghanistan where it goes who knows it's as if these folks can predict the future well I just gave you two Monumental examples where they kept predicting what never happened a thousand variables have to be in place before Mr Putin no matter what he wants could touch another country look at the problem he's having with Ukraine you think he's going to be busy going somewhere else it's going to take him a generation to absorb the cost of this war no matter what the outcome is the idea that those neocons who blew it when it came to the consequence of Vietnam and who blew it again in Afghanistan they know what he's doing what his plans are and what indeed he could accomplish childish the only thing more childish than to make that argument is to be upset when reasonable people don't believe you that shows you really are out of touch you cannot play this game over and over again when it never pans out the world is way more complicated than these simple-minded stories of what has to be done but again the real the the thing that people should understand is if you cannot admit what is going on then you come up with wild fanciful substitutes you cannot admit that for Russia the terrible anxiety was the march of the NATO forces closer and closer to them of course it's a problem given the history of the Cold War terrible anxiety terrible risk what are they going to do they waited a very long time before they made this decision and I'm not sure it was the right decision to make and there's a lot of reasons to worry about it which I'm sure they're doing but it's a very complicated story how this happened but if you can't tell that story then you you can't admit it you can't admit that maybe NATO shouldn't have done what it did maybe NATO should have held on to what it committed to which is not to expand not to further threaten to be satisfied that the Communists had lost in Russia and were replaced by people who were who who celebrated the Russian Orthodox Church which Putin does and always has okay but you can't ask those qu those are not allowed those are questions of strategy questions of choices you made no no no so you have to come up with something else and what do you do you demonize Mr Mr Putin he becomes Joe Stalin all over again minus the Soviet Union and minus communism and here's a parallel also from last night if you can't admit that the United States is now wrestling with the difficult problem of an Empire going down which is a very different set of problems than you have as an Empire going up which was our last Century the last 100 years is mostly about American Empire going up now it's American Empire if you can't admit that then you have to come up with some other simple-minded alternative and here in the United States as in Europe the alternative to facing the decline of Western capitalism is to demonize immigrants childish silly I sit with adult human beings whom I admire they are my friends but they seriously want to believe that the United States a country of 330 million people is traumatized and endangered when 10 to 15 million undocumented Central Americans among the poorest people on the planet have arrived and you know what they want and what they demand a job that's it they don't even eat your pets although if you get strange enough you will imagine that and that's two because you cannot accommodate a conversation about what the realities are and so to answer the question you posed to Michael before what's going to happen here's my answer nothing nothing much is going to change will there be is it better to have kamla Harris in my judgment sure I agree with her on abortion I agree with her on a whole lot of issues I don't agree with this man who is really frightening in in in all that his face shows independent of what comes out of his mouth his response when she confronted him rightly with the fact that he called for the execution of five young black men who were later found to be innocent but that's not the issue he wanted to execute people before they had their trial what I mean that's and he spent the money to put an ad in the New York Times his own money to make this case that's why everybody knows about it as loudly as POS okay I understand there's a difference between that and her but since they don't deal with the basic problems as I think most of what Michael and I have been saying then our my expectation is the decline of Western capitalism will continue because what these people are doing is has nothing much to do with that and it isn't a sustained policy because you can't have a sustained policy if you will not have a conversation about what the problem is it's as if you had the alcoholism problem you went to a meeting of alcohol uh Anonymous and you wanted to know which arm you should scratch and the people said to you what are you talking about well you say I want to know which arm I should scratch to deal with alcoholism and slowly somebody would explain to you that what the quest you're on to determine which arm to scratch is not going to affect your alcoholism it's not going to solve it it's not going to make it go away it's going to be as bad or Worse next week as it was this week because you have you have a problem in being unwilling and unable to deal with what your problems actually are as an economist looking at the United States that's what I see I see Denial on a scale that is genuinely frightening and last night's debate is another chapter in that denial well we're talking so far about the problems with the uh US policy uh and Richard is quite right uh this poses a question uh why don't China and Russia and other countries understand uh what the US policy is uh doing to threaten them and why don't they anticipate uh these sudden attacks these self-destructive uh moves that uh uh they're doing for instance why uh Russia's flamed why on Earth didn't it uh and anticipate the uh Ukrainian surprise invasion of K well Putin uh I think made uh the same uh uh limited scope that Stalin had uh both both of them uh expected other countries to act in their own self-interest and I think we've said it before in this show Stalin did not expect German to attack him at him and Russia because that would be suicidal uh for Germany it would be it would mean the end of Germany well uh why didn't Putin expect uh Ukraine to throw all of its cracked troops uh all of its uh uh the uh Nazi leadership uh troops the most vicious uh of the Azo Battalion why did why didn't he expect them to throw all of the US uh and European uh heavy armaments that they had all of their troops into an invasion of K uh well be that's because it was uh the not the most uh valuable land at all it was uh it was sort of a rural undeveloped part of Russia and uh I think uh President Putin and the generals thought why on Earth would Ukraine make a great sacrifice that essentially will wipe out the whole remaining core of the Ukrainian Army uh why would they uh do something like that just to make a public relations show about oh they can surprise us uh well you can surprise us by committing suicide uh and that's pretty much what they did and I think I'm told that the plans were thought up by British intelligence which is a perfect example of British intelligence probably with the US going along uh why don't other countries be act more against uh the US interest why does China uh while President Biden and the Democrats and uh the Senators and congressmen are saying every week China is our number one enemy why why doesn't it realize gee they're really against us we've got to somehow uh react to this to defend ourselves to uh uh make sure that America is isolating itself not isolating us well the answer is that President Chi of China keeps talking about win-win policy and he thinks that if he can convince other countries it's a win-win that they'll follow it well I think that's what uh gorbachov and the Russians thought uh and uh when the Soviet Union was dissolved and uh Putin apparently wanted to uh no it was it was yelson uh or some of his followers that wanted Russia to be the first foreign country to join NATO uh Russia really wanted to uh essentially be absorbed into uh both of them Michael yelin and Putin both of them wanted to be part of NATO yeah quite true well and imagine if that would have been an America self-interest it could have turned Russia into what it's done to Germany uh and the rest of Europe uh it could have imposed the neoliberalism on it and yet it didn't do it it treated Russia like an enemy but in such a uh self-destructive hamfisted way that it uh it's produced the situation that we have today and while China uh thinks in terms of uh we are going to uh develop and uh increase our economy and our uh relationships linking our economy with the rest of East Asia if we can show a win-win uh the United States only has a Lulu policy if other countries don't agree to our Cold War will'll Bomb them we'll have the National Endowment for hum uh for democracy uh have a stage of color Revolution there uh it will do or you know we'll treat them like we treated Libya and Iraq and uh Syria and the Palestinians and uh like we treated Iran in 1954 in Guatemala in 1953 and Chile later this uh it's an entirely different philosophy of relating to the rest of the world it's not something that you can economically qualify in each other's models because uh they're diametrically opposed models either you achieve Power by the ability to hurt countries and the America can say we have a lot to offer you we can offer you not to bomb you and not to over throw your government or as China's policy is we have a lot to offer you we can help you all get richer as part of a mutual Aid uh Mutual growth and mutual interdependency that's really is what is splitting up the world and the the US uh diplomats don't see it because they're just knocked into uh the only way that they can uh influence other countries is to to hurt them or to threaten to hurt them and at some point presuma uh Russia China and the rest of Asia will say gee the US doesn't want an economic gain for itself it's willing to destroy its own economy uh by following the Neo principles that have de-industrialized it uh by following the Cold War uh strategy of sanctions and isolations that have destroyed what used to be its partner in Germany and Europe and is now driving Europe away and you know someday Europe is going to join the bricks too but that's a generation away it's it's a a whole different way of thinking that's what's happening Richard just let me put up this article that I've sent both of you and here is the former European Central Bank president Mario dragi he's talking about the problems the economic problems that they're having in the European Union and he says that the era of open global trade governed by multilateral institutions seems to be coming to an end and here is what he said and being slowing down for a long time in Europe gr has been slowing down for a long time in Europe but we've ignored it we until I was say until two years ago we would never have such a conversation as the one we're having today because things were sort of going well we were doing well out of globalization unemployment was steadily falling but now we cannot ignore it any longer we've lost our main supplier of cheap energy Russia and now we have to start for our defense again for the first time since the world since the second world war at the same time this is the first year when Europe cannot count on population growth for its increase and U population is set to decline steadily so much that by 2040 there will be 2 million workers disappearing from the labor market every year productivity is weak it's very weak so if we were to maintain our current average productivity of the last five of the last 10 years say it would only be enough to keep GDP constant until 2050 the investment share will have to rise by around 5 percentage points of GDP to levels last seen in the 60s and the 70s and if Europe can no longer provide them to its people it will have lost its reason for being it's amazing that the left has uh uh certainly the American left uh British left uh haven't picked up this it's the bankers it's the right-wingers uh like the alternative for deutan that are making these points not the not the left except for Sarah vagen connect well I think there's also let's be careful here um and I I I betray perhaps a bit of my own uh European background but I said earlier and I meant it that below the surface of European politics these issues are being hotly de contested and fought partly what you're seeing is that Mr dr's report is the process of bringing to the surface and confronting everybody with what has been below the surface when he says only the last few years what he what he's referring to is the last few years of an intense conversation that we are being destroyed by this policy and we have really two choices we either face it and try to do something about it or simply quietly disappear and become an irrelevant place in in you know a part of the world where people go to retire you know or something else but not a central part of the of the economic um dynamism of the world and I think that is a understandable reaction to the fact that the dynamic Center of capitalism the investment growth focused capitalism which was once in England and then it wasn't and which was once in New England in the United States and then it went to the Midwest and then it went to the South and then it went to Canada and Mexico that's what capitalism is it's a system that uses up the profitable opportunities and then looks Elsewhere for them and then moves to where and it it never says goodbye you know I live in near New England I work in Massachusetts when I drove to and from my job I drove by long blocks of four and five story high brick fact Factory buildings that were built 150 years ago for textile manufacturer they've been empty for the last hundred years because there's no industry to fill them they are now places where people have yoga sessions or artists do creative artwork that's what they're there they grow mushrooms in one of them did this is a a kind of a joke if you go to Detroit you can watch the weeds as they grow out of the asphalt parking lots of the empty factories that's capitalism and we are not should not be surprised they moved within Europe then they moved Beyond Europe now they went to Asia and they're going to be in Asia for a while and then they'll look elsewhere smart people in Africa are planning for them to arrive there in a in a couple of decades as they already are the question is how do you deal with a capitalism that works this way but of course you cannot come up with a policy if you can't admit that the capitalist system has within it this bizarre look it has been 50 years now or longer since Rachel Carson writes her book Silent Spring which explains to capitalist that there's something in the capital capitalist system that destroys the physical natural environment and that you better do something about it because you keep doing the same thing it's going to destroy you but the same people who can't hear that they can't hear what Michael Hudson just told them they built up the American Empire by watching what the Europeans did and mimicking them when the Europeans were exhausted by World Wars 1 and two the culmination of how they organized the world the United States went in and replaced them that period is now over they don't know what to do the Empire has developed the capitalism has moved on the dynamism is somewhere else they woke up 10 years ago to discover that the chinesee high-tech companies can do everything Intel Apple Microsoft or any of the others can do and the last 10 years prove it over over over but they don't want to see it notice the strange reversion to a tariff policy something that they used early on when they were coming out of their colonial status to try to cope with competition from Britain now they're doing it again but the whole situation is different you can't use the same policy all the time one of the virtues of Hegel and Marx are explaining to us if you do the same thing over and over again you're going to make a mistake the fact that it works at the beginning is no guarantee that it works at the end you have to be as inventive in knowing when to stop using a theory or a strategy as you were inventive in starting it it's not that you discover it and then you stay with it for the rest of your life that's a mistake of how the world works that misunderstands what contradiction means and I granted Americans do not study Hegel uh which is their loss but they don't but if you did you'd be immediately alive to the likelihood that we are once again facing people who believe in a particular way of doing things who do not understand why you always have to question it why you always have to wonder how changing external circumstances change the likelihood that you're going to succeed otherwise you are going to make terrible terrible mistakes yes I think Mr Putin made his share of mistakes but the West thinking that they could arm and fund Ukraine to fight the Russians that was a bigger mistake to think that they could Russia by not buying the oil and gas meant they didn't understand what the bricks was Russia turned to the bricks problem solved that the United States couldn't foresee it didn't understand it is obvious and stands as a screaming demonstration that they don't understand the way the world works that the Washington Post in the New York Times watches the debate listens to the idiotic things said about tariffs and goes about discussing them as if they weren't idiot tells you something it is a remarkable moment not just of the crisis facing the United States but of an awful awful incapacity to even begin to understand what's going on here it makes these programs like the one you're doing very very important but a little bit odd AF I don't want people to think that Michael and I are unusual I mean we are of course and in American economics particularly so but I'm hoping that they get the notion there might be something here that the fact that we don't sing the same song that you will find in the financial press may not mean that we are dismissible as cooks or something strange we really are and maybe wrongly so but we really are trying to get people to see other dimensions to which they seem committed to blindness and denial Michael I I I think the discussion can be uh clarified by uh realizing that there are different kinds of capitalism uh and the point that I've been making in many of our shows uh we're not in industrial capitalism anymore we're in finance capitalism industrial capitalism takes a long-term perspective for an obvious reason it takes time to invest in a factory to develop a market to spend the time organizing in advance uh a whole uh supply chain and marketing chain uh this is why it's not done in America anymore Finance capitalism lives in the short term I said earlier in the show about PFF policy that uh the industrial uh tariff policy of uh the 19th century uh worked very well because America would import raw materials export uh finished manufacturers now it try it it's doing the opposite it's it's trying to maximize the price of raw materials uh and that's killing the market for manufacturers and that uh it's doing it because you can make money very fast by Smash by breaking up an economy and grabbing everything uh the Russians had the word in the 1990s gravitation for its privatization you could say that the logic of American Finance capitalism is graviti that's what de-industrialization is uh you run down uh not only your industrial plant and uh equipment and Machinery you run down your infrastructure your Bridges your uh roads your uh supply of uh uh p uh radiation infrastructure for the the infranet internet why which is why Richard couldn't talk to us uh earlier today uh this is not the kind of capitalism that people had 150 years ago or 200 years ago this is not the kind of capitalism that Marx described because the kind of capitalism back then uh everybody agreed uh to make industrial capitalism succeed you needed government subsidy of uh basic needs so that the employers didn't have to pay them uh I think we said before on this very show that uh if you're an industrial capitalist in the 19th century uh whether in America or in Britain you wanted government to pay the cost of Education government to provide transportation uh at a subsidized cost government to provide Health Care uh government to provide Waters and sewers now uh it's privatized by the financial uh people so it's it's the it's a difference between long-term capitalism and short-term capitalism and long-term capitalism uh essentially was seen as evolving in the socialism uh and socialism wasn't a bad word uh everybody was using socialism and the question was what kind of socialism was the world going to have well right now uh instead of having that argument what is h Finance capitalism going to evolve into it's going to evolve into a cold war and we can somehow enforce uh a system on the world where other countries have to turn over their economic surplus to the United States to be used in creating a huge military uh expenditure and system of bases uh submarines battleships non-governmental organizations all to surround them this is this has very little to do with the kind of capitalism that anybody expected in the 19th century so you could just as well ask where did capitalism go wrong and is it really the kind of capitalism that people expected and if not maybe we we have to uh see that we're talking about a whole different capitalist Dynamic than uh what the classical economists talked about with value price and rent and uh uh different kinds of uh positive exploitation of workers where at least the profits yes uh employers uh made a profit by paying workers less than what they sold the product for but they Ed their profits to invest in new factories and means of production to expand uh production so Mark said that uh under uh under the capitalist system profits were an element of value uh whereas rent was uh empty it was empty price priced without value is Monopoly rent land rent and uh most of all Financial uh rent as we've seen in finance capitalism so we're dealing with something that's systemic and evolutionary and uh it's really uh they're going in different directions short-term Finance capitalism is going down because it's shortterm and negative and uh uh punitive uh industrial capitalism long-term going up because it was reaching out to include other countries to make a mutually expanded market and for that you needed uh some kind of international diplomacy that that was indeed as president she says win-win as opposed to finance capitalism uh which is basically neoliberalism now and the neocons uh lose lose yeah I think we have come to a point that we can wrap up this session Richard do you have something that no I think uh we have opened up quite a few implications of conversations that we have had before um the only thing I can I can suggest is that the the danger we haven't discussed and I'm not sure there's all that much for us to say about it but is that the frustrations governing the leaders of the United States because their project since they don't understand and will not listen to Alternative well let me use the language that Michael he's right up until the middle of the N of the 20th century people talked about socialism as one of the options workingclass people discusted all the time political parties committed to socialism grew very well over the hundred years from 1850 to 1950 we are coming off of a period of time in which the Cold War effectively shut all that down made everything into a good and evil kind of conversation that rational people either avoided which many did turned away from which many did or surrendered to the language and the polarization that makes rational conversation all but impossible and means that the debates are so constricted that they have the intrinsic interest of what we saw last night on television to it none empty theater theater of of a political sort barely so my hope is is it possible that we can once again talk about capitalism its different forms industrial Financial absolutely socialism which also by the way has different forms that it goes through maybe we should talk about them maybe there's new ones emerging that we don't even bring into the conversation because we need to pretend that they're not relevant or they're not there or that we have proven our bonafides uh to to the enough of the people that we are listen to even a little bit I I have had to spend a lifetime wondering as I still do whether anything I have said has been picked up by people and if so is it because of what I said which is what I would hope or because I went to the pedigreed schools of this country and got all the fancy degrees from them I know how the American academic world works so does Michael and we know how the pecking orders are maintained there and I really do wonder if if I didn't go to those schools if I didn't have the pedigree if I didn't write books whether there' be other voices and so I'm very grateful to you Nima that you haven't organized these conversations they're very important and they shouldn't be constrained by anything because we are doing what a lot of other people could do as well or better but aren't doing which leaves it to us to do it and Michael does it in his way I do it in mine you're doing it in this form and that's in many ways the most important thing to keep going yeah thank you so much for being with us today Richard and Michael great pleasure as always okay same here again my apologies for being like I will try very hard not to do that okay
