when you look at the conflict right now in Gaza we've seen that the Israeli Minister of Justice trying to force Nao to escalate the situation to attack Rafa how do you see the Biden's policy in Gaza how do you see the neto's policy in this conflict well I think what you're watching is best understood by not doing what we call here in the United States getting lost in the weeds and you don't see the big picture you get lost in the little details so I'm going to try to answer your question by talking uh about the big picture Israel is one of the last if not the last effort at what we call settler colonialism settler colonialism that's when a group of people sometime in the last four centuries the history of capitalism a group of people settle in a colonial territory so the British government or the Dutch government or uh somebody else takes over some land usually with military force and then to make it a paying proposition and remember the goal in colonial uh situations was to make the colony pay for its own colonization so for example the first book I ever wrote was about British colonialism in East Africa and they made the people of East Africa grow coffee the single most important product arabica coffee grown in the highlands in the middle of Kenya okay they needed labor so they made the Africans live in reserved areas where they could not sustain themselves there wasn't enough land uh there wasn't enough place for animals so the only way to survive would go to be and work on the coffee Farm of the colonial British who came in got the land for next to nothing and were now provided with the labor and could sell their coffee back into London okay so this was a settler colonialism Australia is another one New Zealand is another one South Africa is another one Canada and the United States are also what you notice though in the list I just gave you is that the settlers found themselves sooner or later in a oppositional position with the local local population and so what began to happen was the systematic destruction of those local people so for example again using my example of Kenya it eventually produced in the early 1950s something called the Mau Rebellion of black Africans rising up against the British and it forced the British out a few years after that um even though they slaughtered huge numbers of African people by that time it was over they knew and the British had to leave here in the United States same thing ethnic cleansing is what the settlers eventually did they destroyed literally by mass killing the native or indigenous people the few that remain are still to this day stuck many of them on reservations where they can barely make a living uh indigenous Americans are among the poorest uh the least healthy uh the most riddled with crime and alcohol and all the rest it became after they were done it became a new world in which ethnic cleansing and the slaughter of indigenous people was no longer celebrated in the 17th 18th 19th century the British thought they were bringing God and civilization and progress and modernity to India or to Pakistan or to fill in the blank but nowadays everybody un not everybody but almost everybody understands that that's not what was going on that there was money being made um it was a standard joke in England that if you could not be successful in your career in England you could always go to the colonies and there you would become a gentleman farmer because all the work was done by the masses in India uh and so forth okay the problem for Israel is that it's trying to do the same thing but but is doing it too late the world is not what it was the balance of forces is not what it was you can't do in the 21st century what was common in the 18th and 19th centuries nobody should be surprised at that but there's deep in the Israeli population a sense of the hypocrisy the hypocrisy of the British or the Americans or the Australians wanting them to make a deal well they didn't make a deal there are no two-state solution for the mayori people in New Zealand or the Aboriginal people in Australia or the indigenous people in the United States and Canada not at all no two-state solution they couldn't even vote in elections here until a few years ago so they they don't have most civil rights and on and on and on so that's the first problem Israel is caught in a historic impossibility the world will not tolerate what the Israelis are doing the very people who did it themselves 200 years ago are now not willing to watch it unfold old here yes for the first few months they all looked away and pretended they didn't have to but now and you know why because the rest of the world the Arab world the Muslim world and the whole world watching this Slaughter is horrified you can't be telling anybody that they're bringing God or modernity or anything else you are slaughtering the people in in order to take the land that's what it's about and the rest of the world protests and that makes it very hard for the um Western World you know Australia New Zealand and the rest of them to pretend that they can be neutral they can't they can't so that's the first problem Israel's project is a historical impossibility you cannot do it now and wherever they draw the red line whether it's going into the camp at Rafa or whether it is by the way attacking a consulate in Damascus of the Iranian government uh without any provocation that anybody has been able to point to just as an act of war in a non-war situation when you're already at War somewhere else this is crazy stuff you know and the world looks at it that way and if they take the troops out of Gaza and put them against he Hezbollah in in the in the North in against Lebanon and so on it'll be the same you can't do this now and the Israelis are discovering they can't Mr Biden has been Pro Israel all of his life he collects huge amounts of money from the pro-israeli uh donors here in the in the United States he has all his alliances built around that and you could see what he did he was 100% for Israel yeah now he's 42% for Israel why has he changed his mind of course not but he sees all around the world the signs of a changed situation he miscalculates because he doesn't understand the big picture you and I have discussed this he miscalculated and the people around him and the European leaders they didn't understand what they were doing going to war against Russia the war against Russia they are losing that war and there's no sign of changing they have escalated over and over again they would never send in tanks they did they would never send in uh surface to air missiles they did they would never send in F-15 fighter planes they did now they will never send troops on the ground they probably will none of it works none of it works here's another sign the whole world is supporting mostly Hamas not Israel therefore they miscalculated they thought they could destroy Hamas they can't every time they kill somebody and they call everybody they kill Hamas every time they kill somebody three more people become Hamas because they saw their mother being killed or they saw their child being destroyed you are creating more Hamas with every day this is crazy this is a policy that is self-destructive but you can't see it in the minds of many in Israel they can't see it any more than um the Americans could see that the Russians could and would mount a serious war effort and not just serious militarily but serious politically serious diplomatically serious you know ideologically they they miscalculated those are the two major Wars right now Gaza and Ukraine and the West miscalculated both of them and no those are not isolated incidents they miscalculated in Iraq they miscalculated in Afghanistan the Taliban run Afghanistan it's very clear and the biggest winner in the Iraq Iran situation is Iran who's supposedly an enemy I mean and you're not seeing any adjustment they can't see what is happening so the biggest problem is a change in the world that these people have set themselves against and if a relatively small group of people Israeli Jews are a small number whatever that is six million 8 million whatever the number is but they're not they're not strong enough to take on the whole world and it's an illusion and a delusion for them to imagine that they can do that they can't do it militarily they can't do it economically they can't do it politically they can't even subdue the people of Gaza and Mr Biden miscalculated even in his own country he thought that this country would be unanimously pro-israeli not true to the surprise of many and I admit I'm one of them I'm surprised at the amount of American sympathy for Gaza for the Palestinians including many American Jews many and Mr Biden is therefore confronted with having insisted we're with you 100% and now he has to retreat it's going to hurt him in the election it's going to hurt him a lot he may still win but he is worried that's the only reason he is telling Mr Netanyahu you better adjust and Mr Netanyahu is talking I'm sure to Mr Trump erogan who was so tough when he was talking about Israel but he didn't do anything and his party has lost it seems that he's changing his policy toward Israel he just turkey is imposing export restrictions to Israel just today they announced that on 54 products in including jet fuel engine oil chemicals and many other things on the other hand we see that 68% of Israelis are supporting this policy in Gaza it seems to me that they're not understanding at the end of the day they have to get along with these countries well yeah let's let's remember their power has always been dependent on and sustained by the power of the United States but they don't understand any more than the leaders in the United States that the power position of the United States is not today what it was 10 years ago or 20 years ago or 30 years ago and that therefore the support for Israel that they used to assume is now this is a terrible shock to them they don't know what to do they cannot uh go against the United States the United States provides 2third of their military equipment you know uh Germany provides about 25% and Italy the rest that's it that's who's and all of these countries all of them even Germany have large movements now that are not in favor when the hooes began to throw missiles on the ships in the Red Sea what I said to people was this every Arab community that is sympathetic to Palestine which is almost every one of them every Muslim Community around the world that watches the West smashing a Muslim population in a very unfair uh battle there they are all looking for ways to push back at Israel and even if they don't want to and are afraid of the Israelis and many of them are they have their own internal population Mr erdogan lost an election for the control of Istanbul and he lost in many of the other larger cities now this is an old struggle in Turkey but it is hurting him and the people he needs to mobilize want him to do something about the Palestinian so now he has to he's worried for his own reasons he now has to do what the hutis did in terms of Yemen but that's not the end of it there are people in pistan who want that government to do something and in Bangladesh and in Indonesia what what is Israel going to do all by itself with an America that is looking longer and longer uhoh we don't want it this is an impossible situation for them and so they hold on which frightened people often do they hold on to the old idea that they can strongly attack in this case the Palestinians they feel that the pales Ians hate them which is got a lot of truth to it and that they are in danger from those Palestinians that's also true the problem is they have to face that they cannot do what they're now doing but their frustration is they don't know what else to do time is not on their side they need to settle that land they need to push those Palestinians off the land bring in people to settle the land so that they have some chance of saying well yes the history was not so good but here we are we've been you we're planting our olive trees and we have our settlements and I mean they should have learned by now that destroying the Palestinians doesn't work savagely repressing them doesn't work bombing the crap out of their cities and towns which is what they've done the last six months it's not going to work either you know what are they doing but again I don't want to get lost in Mr Netanyahu is trying to stay out of jail yes I'm sure he is and and Israeli politics are now dominated by the right wing yes true enough but I think those are the surface below that is a contradiction that to be a settler colonial society having to destroy the mass of the indigenous people this is a project that the world today will not allow and I don't deny that it's taking the Arab countries a long time to do something they yell and they scream and they vote in the UN but you're right they don't do very much but my guess is there's a lot that they're doing we don't see because they don't want us to see it and that makes sense I think Hamas is surprising Everybody by the fact that it's still there I mean they have the support of the people but they also have the weapons they also have the friends abroad they are putting up more of a resistance then was and if if Israel attacks Hezbollah they're going to have a war on two sides going to be very difficult for them and the Israeli economy is is B is a bad joke now it's like the Ukraine economy it's not there it's dependent more and more on the United States at the same time that the United States mostly for internal reasons cannot keep doing this I don't see a way out for the Israelis just like I don't see a way out uh in the war in Ukraine the Russians have said we are not going to lose this war and the West has so far said we're not going to lose this war and they have both said they won't use nuclear weapons at least they won't be the first to use nuclear weapons well if you're not going to use nuclear weapons and neither side is going to let the other side win then what are you saying you're saying this is an endless war you know that's what I see I Israel is caught up in an endless war but I'm afraid if I look at it all the odds are the West will cave in because the cost of an endless war in the west is not worth it whereas the cost of that war for Russia is worth it it and in the end I would therefore bet on Russia but you never be sure and is the same is true in Israel they can fight forever but you know what kind of society is that look I know from the United States here's a statistic more young men who serve in the American Military die by Suicide when they come back home then die in the war the Israelis have been committing unspeakable Behavior that's going to affect Israel Israel has a huge opposition inside the country that talks about what is going on and is against it the Israelis are going to have to work that out and that's going to be an incredibly difficult thing for them to do that's why I know quite a few people in and out of Israel who say and it's not just political rhetoric but who say with real intensity that the greatest damage imaginable is being done to the Israelis they're not yes they're not suffering the bombs I don't want to compare it the suffering of the Palestinians is is for sure the horror the worst of this whole story no question but the Israelis are damaging their position which is a minority position in a small corner of the world you cannot survive if you have gone from the victim of a holocaust to becoming the perpetrator of a holocaust and that's what's happening to the reputation of Israel around the world and that is going to be an unbelievable burden for a country that already has lots of problems Richard if the United States the Senate the Congress decide to sanction turkey in response to what they're doing right now to Israel how do you see the future of relationship between the United States and Turkey do you think that would convince turkey to go to the opposite side to break probably I think that's the most likely outcome but we already see that turkey was once a very strong Ally of NATO and the west and it's already changed all of that um the movement towards Islam the fact that an erdogan could become the leader despite the history of Ataturk and the other secular part of Turkey you know the people who won the election last week that's the same old secular EUR looking uh Modern urban against the mola you know against the the rural The Village the church all of that that's continues to play out you know with the addition of the of the uh ethnic issues but put them aside for a minute so there's already a lot lot of push in Turkey to go East to go further into the Muslim to to to struggle inside and that may lead Eran to go in that direction especially if a growing see this is the key thing if a growing part of the Turkish middle class the Turkish bisi the Turkish industrialists the Turkish Banks the Turkish merchants if they see participating in bricks as a reasonable objective that they can do to replace the business they lose in Europe and North America and Japan they then will move and then it's over then turkey will join the bricks and be uh allied with uh Saudi Arabia and with Egypt and so on uh as an Arab block within the bricks and that's the the fear of the United States but if of course they sanction him then I think they understand probably that they've lost it their only hope then would be to mobilize the business community in turkey and they would then what would happen uh is that they would begin to demonize erdogan and they would do that in a way the way they did it with Putin the way they did it with Saddam Hussein he will become a monster he will become a religious right-wing extreme islamist uh he'll become an enemy of progress he will be the oppressor of women he will you you could see it all coming and that will be the effort to pressure the middle class of turkey to turn against they don't like him anyway so they turn against him even more and then you have the maidan then you then you'll the CIA will come in find somebody who's popular in Turkey to rise up and lead a movement to get rid of erdoan that might work that might that but that's what's left to them that's what's left and you know for the the way the United States has functioned it is producing more and more enemies with more and more reason to get together in hostility against the United States you can't keep doing this without producing your own downfall the big picture of the United States is that the Empire that it once had from 1945 let's say to 1990 it's over what collapsed in 1989 was not only the Soviet Union but with it the dominant position of the United States that too began to collapse the peak when it was a unipolar a g Gonic power that Peak was also the beginning of the decline and until that is understood which it is not and accepted which it is not you will continue to have leaders that make unbelievable miscalculations because they're not seeing this big picture because it is so frightening you know I repeat every Empire the world has ever seen was born evolved and changed over time and then it died the American Empire was born we know where when and how it has evolved over time we know about that so that we all know what the next step is it's finished the only question is not whether it's only a question of when and exactly how and what's going on is we're living through the early stages of that Decline and so what we see and there's much understanding of this in the field of psychology what we see is denial the reaction this is not we are powerful we are still we are we are we are we are losing in the Ukraine and we are losing in Gaza and and there's no amount of twisting and turning at this point that makes that untrue is the United States still powerful yes is it still very rich yes could it turn around these societies probably but it can't do it to all of them and there's now a fundamental new reality there's more wealth gathered in the hands of the bricks than is gathered in the hands of the G7 and this has to be an enormous change that is going to shape everything that happens whether it be Ukraine or Gaza or any other corner of the world Richard I want to talk about a very political subject that John mimer always talking about it he says that might makes right this is the the term he uses all the time and when I don't understand he's obsession with China when he talks about China when even he when he criticizes the war in Ukraine he says no we didn't have to go to this war with Russia because we need Russia to fight against China what where does it come from this type of mindset why they're thinking this way in your opinion why we need to have an enemy why we cannot live together in your opinion yeah well first of all all we can and I'm going to give you in a few minutes some examples of where we have done that um so don't be so quick to accept the premise uh Mir shimer is a very smart man and has much to teach us uh especially in that field of international relations where most of it is really uh poor journalism about it he brings a much more refreshing serious analytical mind to it all um let me take an example from the United States and we can see it by going back for a moment to settler colonialism I remember taking my children when they were younger to a small town in Western Massachusetts the name of the town old old Deerfield and in the town of old Deerfield they've done something very interesting they've reconstructed the way houses looked in the colonial time the early time before the United States was a a country before we were independent when we were a a early New Colony of Great Britain okay and if you walk through the town very interesting the the houses inside and outside you know historians and archaeologists have reconstructed an Old Colonial Village a tourist attraction so it's interesting it's different and I thought it might interest my children which it did but there was also something horrifying because there are little signs uh in front I believe of each house is a little sign about what happened here in 1742 or whatever the year was and the sign read like this on the 18th of July in the evening the Savages came and slaughtered two women and four children and a goat the next house here there was a hanging of savages that were caught stealing cows or horses next house The Savage and I remember explaining to my children something that's very bizarre the Europeans come 3,000 miles across the water from where they were born from where they grew up in Europe come 3,000 miles and enter the territory in which local people have been living for thousands of years take their land kill many of them but they are the Savages everything that happened in Colonial New England was contextualized by the danger to the community posed by the evil other evil others have been part of American life from the beginning you know it you had to make Savages of these people because if you didn't make them Savages what would they be and the answer is victims victims of they didn't come to Europe Europeans came to them they didn't take the land from from the Europeans the Europeans took the land from them the the Israelis have this problem the Palestinians didn't go to Europe the European Jews mostly came to to to that part of the world and they had more money and they had more connections and blah blah blah and so you have a problem here for the Jew again I just want to make the parallel for the Jews in Israel how are they going to look at the Palestinians they could the way the Palestinians do they could say look how poor their income is look how bad their diet is look how early in life they die look at how ill they are look at how poor their homes are then they become Maybe victims but who would they be victims of Israeli Jews so it is it's impossible you can't you can't live with this so they become Savages they're the ones you're not threatening them they are threatening you and everything you're doing is defense everything the Israeli Army does is identified by the letters IDF the Israeli defense they are defending they went crazy after October 7th because Hamas attacked them they actually were victimized just a few of them 1,200 terrible but there was for that moment the real and it it touched the nerve in these people they feel victimized even if they weren't hurt when those Hamas people attacked on the 7th even if they weren't there even if their family wasn't there they felt the anger and bitterness of the the Palestinian population now expressed by Hamas and it we must and we have the right to defend ourselves and we will destroy those who want to destroy us Hamas is a very good a target for them because Hamas actually has a position of getting rid of Israel just like there were some indigenous people in Colonial New England who hated these Europeans given what the Europeans did how could it be otherwise and look at it too in Ukraine those people are dealing with the Russians as evil dangerous outside Savage threats that's it otherwise they would have to take seriously what the Russians are saying which is you attack the Russians speaking people in the eastern part of Ukraine and we're not going to let you do it and we're not going to let you get NATO equipment and bombs and make it all we're not going to let you do that we're not move and it's a defense idea and the the the ukrainians do not want to understand themselves as having been maneuvered into a project of NATO again that they don't want that they want the Russians to be bad and really all they have to hang on to is that the Russians did come first the Russians crossed the border and and that's an issue and that they have the right to bring that up that's not the point the point is notice this procedure in which you feel yourself to be so close to evil and terrible that you have to put all of that on to somebody else the Israelis know what the Palestinians think about Israel they don't want Israel there they feel abused by Israel they feel their land was taken all and there's a lot of Truth to all of that but the Israelis cannot stay there and be the oppressor so they have to do something and what they've done which is what those Colonial people in New England did was to make the other one Savage it's a little bit like for the United States we always needed an enemy when we didn't have the native people to be the Savages or in danger of we fought a war against the colonial Master King George III who dictated we didn't want that 1776 again in 1812 the British Empire thinking itself the Empire upon which the Sun never sets thought they could easily squash their own British people who had become a settler colony in North America they made a terrible mistake they lost the war in 1776 and they lost the war in 1812 but now to show you after that war was lost the British slowly with lots of disagreement came to a recognition you cannot beat the United States into submission you better work out a way that Britain can grow gr and develop and that the United States can grow and develop and they did that that was achieved no more Wars between the United States and Britain ever again the last one 1812 that's 200 years of no war between them even though they were had had Wars between them before and during that period the the bulk of the 19th century and into the 20th century both Britain and the United States grew prospered and developed the United States grew prospered and developed more faster so in the end the British colonial government and the Little Colony reversed their situation and the Little Colony became the dominant economic Empire and Britain became a small cold wet island off the mainland of Europe which is what it is now so they went through an enormous difficult role reversal but they did not fight a war they did not destroy each other in Endless combat so yeah you can come to another solution whether the Chinese mean it or not I don't know I'm no expert ERT on China and I'm not pretending or have any interest in pretending that their motives aren't complicated and and so forth but I don't see them running around the world fighting Wars they're not provoking Wars the United States is provoking war in Taiwan you could see Taiwan from China you can't see it from the United States what in the world is going on sending troops to Taiwan sending military equipment what are you doing again again the United States must have believed in the days when Henry Kissinger and Richard Nixon opened up China and brought them into the WTO that they could control how China developed they couldn't because colonialism is over it's not coming back it's done but they didn't understand it so China with a goal of developing quickly made some experiments they tried the Soviet system government own and operated the Enterprise they tried the let's call it the Scandinavian system lots of government regulation but basically private Enterprise private capitalism and all that the chin Chinese did with their experiments very practical is they came up with a hybrid an economy that is half public owned and operated by the Chinese government and half private capitalist Enterprises some Chinese some Japanese American European 5050 nobody's done that before Russia was overwhelmingly uh Soviet Union was overwhelmingly government owned and operated Britain and England overwhelmingly private and then mixtures but the Chinese are the first really big company to really kind of 5050 and control the whole thing by a powerful government run by an even more powerful Communist party okay I'm not there are problems with this there are injustices that are wrapped up one can make all kinds of criticism and I believe in in in Social criticism and it doesn't stop at China's door but that's no excuse not to see what China has done it has taken the largest population on the earth and pull them out of poverty in one generation no one has ever done that before it took centuries to do that in Western Europe North America and Japan now we have much to learn from that and the Chinese seem willing from what they say and so far from what they do to demand the right to develop their economy but to be willing to sit down and work it out as Britain and the United States were able to do in the 19th and the first half of the 20th century so I don't think we need to be you know me shimer might makes right it's not always this you know conflict and if you have more battleships and you have more troops you win you I mean does that happen sometimes of course is it a necessity no no no no no look Europe suffered unbelievably in World Wars one and two after World War I they tried to develop a way to stop it the League of Nations that failed after World War II they tried again this time they called it the United Nations and while the United Nations has loads of problems we haven't seen Another World War okay okay that's something let's see where we can go with that one of the effects of that has been producing a generation including today that is very nervous about another War it's difficult for the governments of Germany France Britain Italy to mobilize to fight the Russians there are a lot of people who don't want to go anywhere near there they remember what their grandmother told them about what life was like during World War II or one so these wars last a long time leave deep scars shaping politics for a long time Israel is going to learn that lesson again in very painful ways as the Arab countries and the Muslim countries lead the way in finding opportunities to push back to show their own people we are helping the Palestinians we're not politicians who say one thing and do something else and they will discover ways of working out um your situation and again because of the bricks are now a larger richer economic unit there is the economic motive that is going to make more and more countries unwilling to do the the the conf conflicting challenging confrontational foreign policy that the United States pursues and I think most of the world sees it and I really think this is true as the United States being a declining Empire that is terrified about it doesn't want to face it needs to act out roles of the big powerful and then doesn't understand why it seems to make these terrible mistakes losing all these wars spending all this money a Chinese leader once said some years ago you come here and you don't understand the simplest thing to an American visitor do you know how much you spend on Military you call it defense you spend more than the next nine countries combined which includes both Russia and China all right we don't we use that money to lift our people out of poverty so here's the problem for you Mr American said this Chinese person the world is racing to see which is the more successful foreign policy the one that lifts everybody out of poverty or the one that has a military base in 700 places around the world the jury is out on that question is not at all clear but what is clear is that the Chinese have been able to devote their resources to building up their economy and they've done so in a way that no one has ever done before and that has caught the United States unprepared and unable to do very much about it and yeah I'm not Mr Mir sher's need uh and as I say I respect him I've learned from him this is not at all a critique but his need to to see it as a dead end that there is no solution I believe he likes to use the term a frozen war in the that somehow Ukraine will end up being a frozen war with a frozen Russian army confronting a frozen NATO army they can't move forward they they're frozen you know and then he seems to think this will last forever I don't believe I really I don't believe that people on either side would tolerate this
