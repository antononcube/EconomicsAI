what's your take and the reasons behind the failure of the US capitalism before going to this question I'm going to play a clip that fared Zakaria did on CNN the start of the new year is often a time of optimism but look at surveys from the past few months and you'll find that strikingly high numbers of Americans sometimes around 34 of those ped think America is on the wrong track this profound sense of Despair is perplexing because I don't find much objective data to support it the US economy grew at an astonishing 5.2% in the third quarter of 2023 the IMF expects growth for last year to be 2.1% which is substantially better than other Advanced Western Nations such as Canada the UK and Germany inflation is dropping sharply real wages are up and manufacturing employment is experiencing a boom it's hard to find another country where so many measures are pointing in the right direction the broader picture is even more positive as I write in the current issue of Foreign Affairs the US has been besting its competitors in various crucial metrics for a while now the financial times did an analysis of the many ways in which America's economy could be compared with Europe's and it found that in per capita growth America has been outperforming the United Kingdom and the Euro zone for 20 years and has dwarfed the economies of Spain France and Italy America's technology sector dominates the world in a way that no country ever has the value of the top 10 US technology stocks is now greater than the value of the entire stock markets of Canada the UK France and Germany combined let's get to the points that fared raised in this video let's get started with Richard Richard jump in okay um fared zakariah says he's perplexed at the feelings of Americans that things are not going well so let me Begin by saying I'm perplexed that Faria Zachariah is perplexed because I don't find any of this perplexing what he has done and by the way he is not alone this is all over the financial media we are opening the year 2024 with one commentator after another telling us that the economy is in great shape and that the mystery the only mystery is why the average people in America don't seem to understand and how good it all is it's grotesque I mean the honest way to ask this question would be to say I look at the economy as if it were in great shape other people don't why is that what could explain that instead we have here's how the reality is and look at the poor befuddled people who don't understand for me the way to get into this is to use the metaphor of the medical doctor if you're not feeling well you go to a doctor and you say to a doctor please tell me Mr doctor or M doctor uh how am I doing and they do a battery of tests they look at your blood they look at your urine they do x-rays they do a whole host of tests why because they expect some of the statistics will suggest you're healthy some of them will suggest you're not and their job as the doctor is to examine and to weigh the different pieces of evidence to come up with a judgment they are not supposed to give you a thermometer tell you that your temperature is normal and send you home because you don't have a medical problem and you're a strange silly person to have imagined that you do if you if you had a doctor who treated you this way you would know that what you need most is a different doctor and one that could function properly what fared Zachariah has done in company with others is very carefully Cherry Picked a few statistics thrown them together and asked why the world doesn't agree with him that the whole picture is captured let me go through very briefly some examples okay for me one of the most remarkable realities of the American economy in this period of time is the obvious clear decline of the Empire the recent Wars Vietnam Iraq Afghanistan they've all been lost the war in Ukraine is in the process of being lost this is not the sign of an exploding growing Empire the emergence of the bricks as an alternative hole in the global economy whose GDP if you add up the bricks countries is now significantly larger than the GDP of the G7 that's the United States and it major allies that is a momentous change in the global economy compared to what it's been for most of the last 75 years if not longer for the last century we have Monumental inequality in the United States beyond anything that we thought we would see 2040 and 60 years ago we have an opioid crisis that puts the United States at the top of the number of people per 100,000 who die in the prime of their lives outrunning all those other countries he so glibly mentioned we have for the first time in a century a real economic competitor the People's Republic of China at all levels whether it be the highest levels of technology where they are competitive to the little fact that was announced this morning that China is now the world's number one exporter of automobiles now I'm no fan of automobiles but I understand the importance of the automobile in the global economic system I could go on I could talk about the decline of Europe and what that has to do with all of it this but to look at the United States at this situation that we're facing of extreme inequality when most of the financial press is obsessed with asking the question will the economic downturn that we know we are due for last year and the year before but have so far evaded in a way that for example Germany and Italy have not are we going to get that in the next six months in the next year in other words the instability of capitalism is very much with us the pro the notion that K in economics could fix it all could prevent it could stop it all that's gone a year ago I was asked about the consensus at that time that the year 2023 would be difficult that consensus we now know was wrong in terms of the stock market and so on I just want to remind people that today's consensus that everything looks Rosy is on track to be just as wrong in the opposite direction as last year's was wrong and not to be taken by Mr fared zachariah's cheerleading for Mr Biden everything Zachariah said is what is on the wish list for Biden to be reelected that's very nice I appreciate why he would do that but to take it seriously is economic analysis requires of people like Michael and me a level of childishness of which we are I am happy to say incapable well I don't think that anyone goes to CNN to get serious economic analysis anymore than you'd go to the New York Times to read about International Affairs or domestic politics uh but Richard I got the you're not talking about the winners uh and that's really what CNN's all about Let's uh think there are a lot of winners and you got to take them into account the 1% have been the really great winners and the 1% even the 10% own 75% of the stocks and bonds in the United States they're winners the the pharmaceutical uh industry has been great winners and if you're investing in the stock market and have bought military industrial stocks you're a winner uh and uh there are just seven of the information technology monopolies uh that have become winners so let's uh look at the winners uh now the problem is and what Nea says is the failure of capitalism is the rest of the 90% are the losers and uh that's not what uh either CNN or the New York Times talks about so uh that they're they're focusing on their audience and uh we have our audience presumably the people who are watching this show uh and our audience does not get richer when GDP goes up uh and especially if GDP goes up because uh the military industrial spending is soaring because pharmaceutical prices are soaring uh my wife is on uh her employer pays for her health care and the money we the uh fees we have to pay at the local drugstore were Quin couple on January 1st uh so the a the average American person who says they're not doing well uh is talking about a completely different world from the 10% and in fact we're in a kind of Financial aparte and since AAR tiddes in the news you know I think we should look at just the financial uh split between creditors and debtors and something remarkable has happened in the last few years if you look at the Federal Reserve balance sheet which is what the % looks that the Federal Reserve loans to banks have gone way way up uh just as the amount of debt has gone way up so the banks seem to be getting richer and richer and the debt seems to be going getting larger and larger uh but all of a sudden there's a word that used to be used in the 19th century Marx used it but also other people it's called fictitious Capital uh and that's what's on the front page of the Wall Street Journal uh uh in the last couple of days uh when we're talking about one sector that is not doing very well and that's commercial real estate uh the uh commercial real estate in the United States is only 40% occupied right now uh if you have a brand new luxury building that's occupied uh but most of the uh properties are not now uh a lot of these mortgages are all coming due in the next uh year or two now what do you do if you're a banker and you've uh lent a balloon mortgage to a buyer no money down just a 100% mortgage to buy a hundred million building but all of a sudden this building's only worth 40 million well just like you had uh buyers uh working walking away from junk mortgages uh after uh uh the Obama uh Bank bailout uh with jingle mail they just say well why uh this my property is overpriced because of bank over lending why should I uh pay this $300,000 mortgage for a house and I can buy the house next door for 150,000 now mail the uh e back and uh buy the other house well that's now what commercial real estate developers are doing now that they're not getting their rent to pay the interest why should they use their own money uh to pay the bank they're simply uh walking away and uh what are the banks going to do when if you look at the bank balance sheets the banks are doing very well they're very solvent he their Assets in excess of their liabilities they're getting rich they're paying big bonuses for the leaders but uh if you valued these properties at the current market price all of a sudden here are the assets and here are the liabilities they're beginning to look like the average American family 50% has no savings at all but here are the liabilities for credit card student loans well you can imagine how uh this is upsetting the Biden Administration how is he going to get by to November that's really what we're talking about well the first thing he does is we've got to get other the people back into the office building how are we going to do that we're going to tell them covid is over don't worry you don't have to wear masks uh uh get back into the buildings uh they're really said they're not doing anything to warn people about the co epidemic and the long covid they they want them to get back into the building so that their employers will pay the rent to pay the banks so the banks will not have to write down their balance sheet from 100 million to 40 million uh it's all about the bank so uh if if you're a creditor and the 1% Capital Finance capitalism is a great success uh if you're a wage earner uh things is not a success because you know how you're being uh exploited at work and how you can't leave your job because you lose your pension rights and your health care coverage and uh all of a sudden you fall behind in your credit card debt your rates would go up 20% to 30% per month so uh that really you know we're talking about a different world Richard yeah no I I agree but I let me go back I think you know we're we're we're filling in the gaps of the story that that each of us has to tell and and that's and that's good that's as it should be but I do want to go back because even with the GDP numbers and everything Michael says about it is correct let let's be a little bit of honest the United States Mr Zachariah tells us had one quarter of 5% but it's basic you know performance is much closer to 2% last year and I want to remind everyone that the People's Republic of China is reporting 5% which is low for them but is way ahead of what is happening here in the United States which means that the closing of the gaps between the United States and China and its iies and the bricks that's continuing and if that has shaken up the world economy which even the American leaders admit that shakeup which they admit is going to continue and it only continue in the same direction but there's not a word about that it's absolutely extraordinary that that's the case that has changed everything every country in Asia Africa Latin America that has a problem now it needs money to build a rail Road it needs money to set up a proper Health Care System it needs money to exploit a resource it discovers onshore offshore they used to have to go to New York or London or Paris and and beg on their knees and take the worst conditions imaginable for the grants or the loans or the they don't do that anymore they have options they can go to the east they can talk to the Chinese or the the Russians or the Indians or the Brazilians and they can compare and contrast and take the better offer which they are getting more and more from the other side which reorganizes the whole world economy let me give you one more example all of these powerful countries that are doing so well that fared Zachariah mentions United States and Europe they all told us that at the beginning of the year 2022 they would Prevail Russia would be driven to its knees the ruble would collapse absolutely none of it happened this powerful Western capitalist system has shown itself to be what the Chinese once called Paper Tigers they're not able to do any of what they promised and now they are bleeding that they've run out of ammunition it's hard to believe the level of incompetence but if they're all so powerful if they're all so strong if they're all so successful as Mr Zachariah wants us to believe how do you account for the lamentable failure in in Ukraine that that we read about every day last point a very poor country in the world Yemen has a group of people usually referred to as the htis who have been able to stop traffic in the Red Sea which is a major artery for shipping particularly of of energy oil and things like that okay and that is now threatening Western shipping they do it out of solidarity with the Palestinians okay what might seem to be a small if horrible struggle in Gaza turns out to have ramifications on the World economy if the price of oil goes back let me remind you the years 2021 and 2022 were years of stunning inflation the barrel price of oil in those years flirted with $120 a barrel today it is $72 a barrel it has come way down which is a major part of why we don't have the horrible inflation we had but what comes down in 24 months can very easily go right back up in 24 months this prediction that we are in great shape is based on a careful forgetting of what we have just gone through it's a remarkable exercise in rose-colored glasses of which Mr Zachariah ought to be ashamed well if I can take the role of Mr Zachariah he would look at uh the houthis uh threatening to sink a ship in the uh uh oil go uh and forcing uh shippers to go around South Africa uh this is increasing GDP because it now costs a lot more uh for all this shipping this shipping is GDP and uh we you're absolutely right we've used all the weapons we had in Ukraine uh this is really going to add for GDP uh Germany says we have to re uh you know we found our our inner naism uh we're going to support uh uh the Ukraine they're going to begin uh putting huge orders in for American Arms because they can't produce arms without having the the energy and the oil because arms require uh metals and that requires heat in order to melt and make alloys for the tanks so uh all of this is going to be a great increase in GDP uh but I do think you're right there there really doesn't seem to be a plan B for the United States the uh the plan B I guess it's sort of like uh the election coming up uh and what Biden's election plank I'm not Donald Trump well America says we're not communist China okay we're not communist China but Donald Trump moved a lot quicker than uh Biden has moved uh to cure the covid crisis he at least had operation War speed and that's from a Republican uh and uh uh Donald Trump said he didn't want to go to war with uh uh with Russia and Ukraine but if he were there there wouldn't have been a war well uh he would not have increased uh GDP by military spending so uh you're uh again uh we're uh somehow if you are writing for uh CNN or the New York Times or the Washington po uh anything can be fit into uh a a celebration speech by President Biden uh for uh the reasons why he should be reelected just by saying I'm not the devil and uh uh you describe China is not being the devil but again and again Biden says that's the enemy and uh we need in America a free market a free market means you can only buy from us because we are the country of Freedom after all we are the uh exceptional country uh you can't by from each other I mean what you're doing with the bricks uh you know we've got toh get the National Endowment for democracy in there to have regime change uh in these countries and uh essentially turn uh as many of the bricks as possible into uh into the Ukraine so you know uh that apparently is is the plan B uh I'm not sure how that is going to affect uh the 99% of the American population but you can be pretty sure that the 1% is going to come out on top yeah and I think what you're seeing is you're seeing a case study of the function of American politics these debates between the Republicans and the Democrats are carefully orchestrated to distract us from what the real issues are so we're going to have debates about Hunter Biden's corruption we're going to have debates about crime in the streets we're going to have debates about Taylor Swift sexuality this is going to be wonderful we're not going to talk about the underlying inequality by the way the inequality of wealth and income in this country has gotten steadily worse for the last 40 years Republicans and Democrats have been stunningly equal in their inability to do anything about it the Republicans pretend it isn't there the Democrats say it's a serious problem but Nei neither of them does anything even across the pandemic the inequality got worse and yet it's not an issue it's not a debate it's not there's no program being put forward to to deal with it Mr Biden talks about the big spending programs my God we've had that before when the government spends big on infrastructure or renewed manufacturing two things people should think about number one the bulk of that money goes into the hands of the biggest corporation in America and we know what they do with it we know how that wealth gets distributed it goes to the top 10% in dividends and and and pay packages for top Executives it goes to the minimum it can get away with and with artificial intelligence half of the jobs it might have gone to in the past won't even be there anymore we kind of know this is not going to change uh anything in this Society so that the mass of the people are seeing a change is not coming here and the whole point of politics is to focus on things that couldn't in a million years make for change they're utterly irrelevant uh for Change and the last thing he here's a a for me always a kind of remarkable uh absence uh of of focus in in our politics we have a society that is seriously divided we know that we admit that we see it on television we hear it in the speeches we know that this is very serious and we know it could be exploded at any moment by any kind of event not just domestic but also foreign look at the amazing uh opposition to the US policy with Israel and Gaza I don't think anyone expected this level of opposition given the history of US relations with Israel in the past so obviously domestic viewpoints are not what people thought they were well what is that about why are people upset in the way they are why are millions identifying with the Palestinians who didn't seem to have done that in the past Palestinians have been in a rough place many times over the last 75 years if you know the history of that area Okay so wow we have obvious but no none of that counts the political debates go on about what Hunter Biden and impeachment and all of the they made no difference they're not going to make a difference but the issues that people really care about that are urgent that could upset the whole whole apple cart of the American economy I mean Michael and I can go through with you the level of debt of American corporations is off the chart they look they use the last 20 years of near zero interest rates to solve every business Problem by doing the easiest quickest cheapest thing borrow Limitless amounts of money from the Federal Reserve at virtually zero interest so they are way over INB given their normal range of problems what are they going to do now they can't borrow at those rates anymore that's not likely to come back etc etc these are the real problems and I'm not even going into the level of government debt and the level of household debt which are also you know swords of democles hanging all of that is magically disappearing in zacharias's rendition our our only problem is to persuade our silly backward population that things are really wonderful this is what used to be called pangloss this used to be a kind of Rosy colored glaze over people's eyes we can't afford that anymore the US is not the dominant economic Powerhouse it once was and this is mostly a vast program of denial and pre tense to cover over that hard to digest reality well Richard at the beginning of your comment you mentioned the inequality of wealth and debt uh but you you said that pretty quickly they're really very different uh or wealth and income I'm sorry income is really uh GDP income is what people earn uh the the wealthiest people don't make their wealth from income if you look at all of the Great fortunes that have been created really since the 1980s that hasn't been people saving up their income that's capital gain that's asset price inflation that is a bank inflation of uh the price of uh stocks and bonds but also the real estate uh that everybody has to pay and uh the uh inequality of wealth is so much larger than the inequality of of income for most of the population wealth has not increased at all yet you've had an exponential growth of wealth uh in the American economy how could you have an exponential growth of the stock market the bond market wealth Financial wealth real estate wealth and uh nobody uh in below the 90% uh if you look at the overall figures has been uh getting wealthier uh how is it that all of this wealth is concentrated at at least people have enough money to live on except for the a few million homelessness homeless in New York and San Francisco and the other places so uh you when people talk about GDP and income uh look at what they're they're distracting attention from wealth now if you look at the growth of wealth uh uh you see like a hawasi wave of going up the same wave is that of Deb so the growth of wealth equals uh matches on the other side of the balance sheet the growth of debt so uh the problem is that the people who have the wealth on the asset side of the balance sheet the creditors are not the people who owe the debt on the liability side of the balance sheet so all of this growth in wealth when people talk about PE uh look at all the uh famous uh people and CEOs and entrepreneurs getting richer they're not talking about the 90% getting deeper in debt uh that they have have to pay and uh uh you can look at right now uh in at the student debt uh the student debt is been it was President Biden who uh innovated the fact that let's make the student debt immune from people's ability to wipe out in bankruptcy only the wealthy people can wipe out their debts but if it if somebody is so poor that they have less than $50,000 a year to spend on education and actually have to borrow the money they can never rep pay their debt and the result is that these people cannot uh because they have to spend so much money on the student debt they can't afford to go to the bank now and take out an uh another loan to buy a house of their own to start a family in so all you you you're having ownership of American Property declining uh and you have especially ownership of property in the last five years plunging for uh the black population uh and to a lesser from the Hispanic population so you're having the economy shift all of a sudden from uh a uh a democratic economy back into what you had in the 19th century a hereditary landlord economy except the landlords are now Financial firms uh because it's the financial firms like uh that the private Capital that is buying all buying up the houses that families can't afford to buy themselves because they can't borrow the money for it because they're already to indebt it so you're having again housing apartheid debt apartheid Financial apartheid uh you're having a multi-layered economy that's splitting in two and nobody's what you're really complaining about in statistics is that people are not talking about the split of the economy and it's that split uh that is widening that is the most serious uh problem of all uh you don't see Biden doing anything to uh free uh the uh the student debtors uh from the burden they're freeing uh the wealthy people don't have to pay debt uh but also the uh the the income uh doesn't seem to be as uh unequal as their wealth be you remember what Leona Helmsley uh the hotel Queen said only the little people pay taxes if you have income you have to pay taxes on it the rich people don't make income they make capital gains or they make uh uh somehow they make economic rent they don't have it's counted as earnings in the GDP but most GDP uh uh earnings for the uh wealthier uh 10% of the population isn't earned at all it's it's what John Stewart Mel said made in their sleep like coupon Clippers they collect the interest they collect the rent they don't create the housing they borrow money to buy it they don't there's no labor there that's creating value there it's all an economic rent and nobody is using even the vocabulary that they're using they're they're not saying a rent seeking economy or rtier economy all these seem to be obsolete words like user is an obsolete word anything that uh points to something that is uh not being discussed by the Republicans Or democrats is uh considered AR and sort of impolite so you know perhaps one of the things we can do expand the vocabulary of people to focus on things that uh we would look like them to look at for what's really happening in the economy Richard if I could just add another another point to all of this the reason you want to talk about the real issues is because they're not static they're not just sitting there this growing inequality whether it's of the wealth as Michael has just laid it out or of income or of them together or of the inequality politically and culturally which flows from the inequality of wealth and income as they the rich being smart understanding what Michael has just said they know that as they become more and more the holders of this wealth and the rest of the population becomes indebted they understand they're a small minority and the people indebted are a very large majority and where you have universal suffrage that is very dangerous therefore you need to use a portion of your wealth to shut down the political system so it cannot threaten this inequality that you've built up that's how capitalism preserves itself that's why it corrupts the political system it has to because otherwise it can't be secure in the inequality that its system generates you know we had Thomas petti just a few years ago do us a nice job of 600 Pages explaining how capitalism everywhere and anywhere it settles produces deeply in unequal distributions of income and of wealth but what he didn't quite finish was telling us that that inequality economically then has to corrupt politics not because people are mean or stupid or evil but it's only to protect the very way that the system works now an honest presidential campaign would talk about that would would face it and would offer something that might deal with that we have an election that does not do any of that Trump doesn't do it Biden doesn't do it their advisors don't do it Nobody Does it it's left to the media people like you Neeman i i i congratulate you for doing it to bring on people who can talk about the politics that isn't being brought into the play of this election that ought to be so it's not just that they're not doing their good job of covering but they are really doing a disservice with this Rosy colored uh happiness we're we're all in great shape what an amazing thing to say in the middle of two disastrous military Wars with no end in sight for either of them with a level of domestic hostility uh you know making people think of Civil War again and to talk about it I mean we have problems that are obvious and Mr Zachariah doesn't want to see any of it and the New York Times neither it's extraordinary as a cultural uh phenomena even as we go through um uh the real economics that is being uh magically disappeared on us here well you're complaining about uh turning politics into a free market up for sale to the highest bidder you've had a privatization of uh politics by the donor class and uh uh the uh the uh winner is uh the candidate who can raise the most campaign contribution to buy the television time and the political apparatus and control of the press to uh uh to get elected uh for either party so uh basically it's the you're having what what's happening in politics happen in education as you've just seen in the number of University presidents who've uh had to retire the donor class have become the uh the main Trustees of the universities and they said uh you know you're uh what are you going to do you're go are you as University president uh going to be concerned with uh with what you're teaching the content or are you going to be concerned with your donors you know who are you working for and uh the donors won uh at Harvard and the donors won in Pennsylvania and the donors May uh win in politics uh uh if uh at least the two parties are what you mean by politics uh I've got to have truth and uh uh truth and statement I'm an economic advisor to Jill Stein on the uh green party ticket and uh she is not expecting to get uh a don uh contributions from the goat brothers or uh the uh Wall Street or the others the problem is how uh uh it it costs uh maybe $4 million just to get on the balance in various uh uh cities and states and the Democratic and political uh uh party have done what uh the premarket usually leads to a monopoly uh and they've used their Monopoly to prevent uh third party uh candidates uh from uh even getting on the ballot uh because that's not a free choice uh you're voting for uh uh when you vote against the Republicans Or democrats you're voting against Americans that's not a free good choice Accord you know what they say and uh they want to protect uh the population from making the wrong choice uh of voting for a a third party candidate so you know that's really part of the uh uh the whole uh problem here uh how are you going to uh even get issues uh into a campaign if the Republicans and Democrats will not uh permit a third- Party candidate from asking these questions in a political debate if you have the Republicans the Democrat it's going to be just like you said Richard they're going to talk about how can we distract voters uh are we uh take out what Nikki Haley says should we change the name of the defense department to the war department as she recommends well you know there I guess there's a point in uh uh linguistic honesty of that but that's uh uh she doesn't say we shouldn't go to war she really wants to uh accelerate the war well how are we going to get an anti-war candidate like Jill Stein from getting from raising the kind of questions that you and I are raising I mean the problem is not Zachariah the problems the whole the whole Democratic Leadership committee the whole Democratic party the Republican party uh the the whole uh uh BL uh Monopoly that uh tries to crowd out uh uh what we're discussing with a just plain noise uh and the result is you have noisy elections uh without uh the content that we're trying to put in how are we going to get that in if I could add and I don't and Nima let me know if I'm talking too much I'll be glad to stop but go on here here's another dimension uh to get at this for much of my adult life and since I'm a similar age as Michael I know what I'm I'm saying is true for him too we were professors of Economics we still are in an environment in which we were told that the great debate of Economics is whether the government intervenes more or less do we have a quote free economy or do we have a free market or do we have a government interventionist along the lines that ks's arguments of the 1930s brought to the four that was the great and we were told from most of that time certainly ever since the 1970s that the way for Success the way to grow the way to lead the world was the United States to be the home of less aair the home of minimizing governmental intervention uh we had to do it for a short time because of the Great Depression that's now behind us the 1930s are nearly a century away and so we are now in the modern last half century we are free marketeers blah blah blah okay under under President Trump and in cons continuing with Biden we have as a nation radically dropped that attitude we are now engaged in what used to be called economic nationalism the United States government is systematically funding with tens or hundreds of billions of dollars the computer chip industry both the making of the chips and the making of the Machinery that goes into the chips it is expanding to do this in many other areas it has gotten the approval of the Republicans to spend wild amounts of money trying and by the way failing but trying to match the Chinese in a whole range of areas with lots of subsidy which by the way the Chinese also do but you would imagine having changed course so dramatically in such a short time that the Democrats and Republicans would have something to tell the American people what are we doing is this shift really the best idea and if we are going to become economic nationalists if the government is going to use massive amounts of its funding capability to intervene why is it intervening only en large contracts for big corporations why is it not intervening in massive programs of public education Public Health Care public fill-in the blank what a remarkable choice to be made it's not at all clear that that's how you do it the government has been funding the chip companies but Huawei a company targeted by the United States has in fact now leapfrogged all over the United States and is now producing a more advanced chip than either they or any American company is able to do nor is that going to stop so not only have they chosen to be economic nationalists in a very peculiar skewed way but they're not even doing it very well because they're allowing Corporate America to snatch those monies for their profits and their dividends and all of that instead of any kind of management for what they claim they are interested in it is a spectacle and again politically silence no Republican no demo everybody that's the one thing Biden could get through he got spending big time for big companies to do big projects what an amazing dereliction of Duty that Mr zachar Ras managed not to see or comment on at all Richard what you just talked about the role of government is the most important issue that people should be talking about this is what changed so radically in the 1980s with Margaret thater and Ronald rean uh as you pointed out when we went to school the uh every we knew that every country from uh uh England and Germany to the United States in the 19th century every country got rich by government spending on infrastructure uh the idea with that government would provide free education would provide free health care govern uh government would make sure that uh it could avoid monopolies by uh building natural monopolies Communications with government the post office was government Transportation was uh uh in most countries not the us but was uh in All European countries had National Airlines national railroad uh uh government uh had the basic infrastructure in order to keep the cost of living low and that was in the interest of industrial Capital so that the employers didn't have to pay their workers enough to pay for their own education to pay for their own health care to pay monopolies to get to work on public transportation uh and uh communication all of that changed in the 1980s uh by which time we we we'd already finished our education decade before and the whole idea was that somehow private Enterprise could do it cheaper with the free market uh Advocates of the free market call themselves Libertarians libertarianism is a centralized planned economy it's planned by the financial sector it uh the I and that's what the free market is if uh the E economic investment is determined by credit and the credit is uh provided by private Banks not by the treasury and not by funding the government to build infrastructure then you're going to have an economy that looks fued and reionized and will end up by looking like uh England looked uh devastated after Margaret ater and America was uh essentially polarized uh all the inequality really takes off with the uh Reagan administration and that that is you pointed out exactly the thing that the government uh isn't uh financing actual uh industrial uh production um you can see the big change that occurred in China uh around 1980 end of the 1970s uh the Chinese wanted Western advice they didn't want Marxist advice because they thought that that was going to be uh too much like the old Soviet system but didn't work they invited Milton Freedman over from the University of Chicago and Milton Freeman actually said let 100 flowers bloom you're no one can plan something that hasn't already existed uh you let uh innovators develop uh uh the U new new products and you can then use infrastructure to uh help them help promote this investment and uh if they make too much money you can tax it away or do whatever China has done to Jack ma who got uh very rich uh and uh you had a you have a mixed economy in China you no longer have a mixed economy in America the libertarian free market economy is a monopolized economy run by the Banks is the mother of trusts uh so they you you have a kind of or willan vocabulary in uh at least when we went to school uh uh we we we knew what Orwell 1984 vocabulary uh was all about uh I've got to admit that I didn't learn anything uh in my getting an economic PhD uh I worked uh in the bank uh Chase Manhattan mainly and other Banks Arthur Anderson doing economic statistics largely of uh on the balance of payments and uh corporate uh uh finance and I I found a completely different story from what was uh uh taught in the university and uh David Rockefeller uh when he would assign me at task said uh you know we want you to say you know whatever you find uh we think we know what the answer is but can look at it if we don't like what you say we won't publish it but we want to know what it is so you have the 1% with one you know knowing something just like uh you and I are talking about and as a matter of fact uh there were like three major Financial economists uh uh maybe four in Wall Street uh during the 60s when I was there we were all marxists and uh we would meet uh once a month at uh sauro Noodle and I remember one evening we were all ended up talking about uh some formulas that marks had in volume three and we all broke out laughing uh why why are we the economists for uh all of these Banks and the answer is because we didn't go to we didn't learn about economics by going to school for a PhD we all had a uh a similar back ground that uh is not considered in polite company but uh the the banks wanted to to lean on that on us well they're not looking at Marxist anymore and without Marxist to gr cap to guide capitalism where on Earth is it going well let let me add since we're doing a little bit of a personal note here here are Michael Hudson and myself I did go to the university I went to the universities that I was told were the best that the United States could offer so I went to Harvard then I went to Stanford and I finished and got my PhD at Yale my macroeconomics Professor was James tolbin my International economics professor was Robert triffin I could go on if you in the business you know all these names in my class atel getting her PhD about the same time I did was Janet yelen it's all the same I would raise my hand and ask questions about the problems of capitalism that I saw all around me Yale is located in New Haven Connecticut New Haven Connecticut has the bizarre distinction of being among the 10 poorest cities in the United States because of the huge population of Black and Hispanic poor people that live in the ghettoised half that isn't white so the problems of American capitalism are screaming all around you and I would ask questions and I would see that my professors had one of two reactions either they didn't know the answer and were honest enough to say so which some of them were or they did know and their eyes pleaded with me not to pursue the conversation in the classroom because it was the time of the Cold War and one was not supposed to to go where marxian questions critical of capitalism might take you so I had to do it all on my own with a handful of other students in order to learn from the marxian tradition in my case the kinds of things that Michael Learned in the Practical Arena of Bank financing we had to go outside but that what that means is and what Mr Zachariah ought to know is that the official academic world of Economics is a now a 75e Enterprise in avoiding knowing what the other perspective might be it's it's childish you know the American Military study what the Russians are doing in Ukraine they want to learn what their strategy is what how they use their weapons how they mobilize their troops they need to know so they can learn what might be better than what they're doing well it works in economics too and yet instead of dealing with the real economic problems that Michael and I have been talking with you about we have fared Zachariah and he is typical he's smarter than many of them he he does his job well but it's a job of Make Believe of pretense of denial and it's a job that can't Engage The Real issues because it comes out of a program and remember the universities that's where the journalists get trained that's where the professors and teachers get trained that's where the CEOs get trained and that's where the politicians get trained so it's an important place and if they tell you that what's important is not learning any of this other stuff well then you go through the rest of your life with a big fat void which is partly what this conversation is exposing well you mentioned I think Zachariah simply because Nima mentioned him as an example but uh yeah I think uh you you could really be talking about the Nobel Prize committee yeah that's really what we're talking about the Nobel Prize is given uh just to reinforce the neol it's the ne liberal prize uh it's it's a a a dumps prize it's given to people like Paul Krugman uh you you know who write for the New York Times about how uh every everything is nice in the economy because the one the stock market is doing so well and why won't people celebrate with the richest 1% and live vicariously it's a a vicarious economy that they're trying to uh encourage so uh really I wouldn't want to uh single out uh Mr Zachariah I think you should spread the credit around uh to the people who deserve it uh universally and the Nobel Prize committee is mainly people who have won the Nobel Prize before so it's a self-perpetuating tunnel vision we are not going to win it I I've got to I hope you're not waiting no no I I long ago understood that that phone call will never come already in the 70s I stopped calling myself an economist I called myself a futurist uh because that doesn't mean anything and of course then I I did get associated with Harvard but as an archaeologist so I think thinking of myself I think of myself as an archaeologist because I found uh that uh people were able to solve the pro all these problems that we're having today uh came out long before and already in the uh third millennium BC 2500 BC you had all new Eastern countries when they would have debt growing so uh large that people were going to lose their freedom and lose their land they the rulers cancel the deaths they knew how to cope with a problem like we're having today uh it all changed with Western Civilization uh and that's why you know we can say not people are talking about is the US a failed State you know for the first time uh reading President Putin and uh president Chay they're talking about whether Western Civilization is a failed civilization you know that the big picture uh not what this election will be about in November yeah you know just a footnote on that there are several world religions that have built into them a concept which some of them call Jubilee and the concept of Jubilee in some of them is exactly what Michael just said when an economic relationship in this case the debtor creditor relationship lending becomes overwhelming because you have so unbalanced your economy that you have a large group of your people uh in debt to another group of people and that that creates all kinds of bitterness anger Envy suffering in short social lack of social Community or cohesion then you have to act and Jubilee is the religious Sacrament if you like that uh sanctifies and what they do is they reshuffle all the debts are cancelled the ownership of land is changed and the land is redistributed if you were lucky last time and you got land where it rained a lot and the sun Shone and the soil was furtle you would now be assigned land that wasn't so good and the person who got the crappy land before would have a chance at the better land but they would all know that if this got to be extreme they would be another Shuffle so nobody could get up on a high horse and imagine that they could or that they could leave to their children some immutable longterm look at it now here in the United States a married couple can leave over 20 if my numbers are right 22 23 million dollar of assets to their children before they become liable to Federal inheritance tax this is the effort to create a permanent class of the rich gone is any pretense even of a Level Playing Field of the idea that we start together and see how well we can do with our efforts not at all we are going to be doing as well as our grandfather and we can't even remember who he stole the money from in the first place it's it's really and again none of this is discussed we have radically altered the inheritance tax structure of the United States over the last couple of decades that's not going to be Revisited Mr Trump doesn't say a word Mr Biden doesn't say a word their advisers don't say a word it is a stunning adjustment as Michael says to a different kind of economic system in which we all pretend that there are no alternatives nothing to be debated or discussed nothing to be argued for or against no let's spend a lot of time on Hunter Biden's laptop I'm so glad you mentioned the Jubilee that's what my 20 years at Harvard uh with the peata museum the anthropology department were all about my book uh uh and forgive them their debts is all about uh the origin of the Jubilee and Sumerian Babylonian Egyptian and other near Eastern legislation and the Jubilee law of Leviticus 25 was word for word from hamar robi's uh Jubilee uh declaration which is uh the same uh words that were used by every member of his dynasty and uh the samarians before him and the Assyrians uh a after him uh I headed a group of an archaeologists and anthropologists and theologist just that uh published five volumes of colloquia on rewriting the economic history of the near East to emphasiz how they avoided the polarization that subsequent Western Civilization had by the debt cancellation by freeing the debt Bond person by restoring lands that had been uh lost in debt uh this is now accepted by all serologists is the norm there's not a word of it in uh economic history uh economic history plays no role in the economics curriculum so it's as if it's been blacked out of History uh some the idea that history begins uh with only the West leaving out every successful Society uh you talk about the inheritance tax uh already in the Neolithic uh they' solved the problem of inheritance what did they do they buried the jewelry and the wealth with the person who died so that it wouldn't be given uh to to the successors that's why they AR there's so much uh tomb robbery and Grave robbery because uh they didn't want this wealth to be conveyed and become a hereditary class in a an EPO when most we was made by impoverishing other people not by adding uh to it as modern technology enables us to do uh all of this should really be the starting point of economics how did economics interest begin it began with being cancelled when it got too large uh and the long before Judaism and Christianity uh you have the a him shamash the Babylonian uh uh God of Justice uh saying that uh uh if you have money you should invest it long-term in tangible assets not short-term Usery uh you think that you know what a what a great uh starting point and uh you could take these various laws they had them and just imagine what that would do to today's society not something that the 1% would support and you know Nima what what Michael just said is as topical right now right now in January you know 2023 As It Ever Was a thousands of years ago look for example here's simply every single country in Asia Africa and Latin America is now desperate because it has loans it cannot carry interest rate it cannot pay it is make every day in decisions across the world the majority of people are doing without medical care without roads without water without toilets without the most basic needs because they have to service debt which they have accumulated at the same time Elon Musk is the owner of 250 billion dollars which he can't even figure out how could anybody how to spend such an amount of money who could have everything in the world he needed if he had one billion leaving the other 249 billion that might be there for who knows debt relief what a fantastic alteration in the condition of the world countries that could go to work building the the the needs of their people rather than having war rather than having desperate decisions that set parts of their Community against one another the election the other day in Argentina would have been completely different if they weren't laboring as that country has under levels of debt that are unbelievable and levels of inflation that are their desperate way to work out of that because they can't access Jubilee or they can't access debt forgiveness there are movements around the world for debt forgiveness they really are and they're fairly powerful particularly in other parts of the world but again on something as fundamental as that that could really change the politics and the economics of the world in the election here in the United States not one word it's amazing what what levels of self-denial we are living through at the very least we ought to have as a national discussion is facing a bit of that reality rather than pretending it isn't there well actually you don't need a penny uh to be spent on debt relief all you have to do is cancel the debts uh take the student debt all that President Biden has to say is we're not going to the student debt is guaranteed by the us we're not going to collect them you don't have to pay it uh we realize that it never should we never should have made you pay such a go into a lifetime time of debt that would impoverish you and prevent you from having a house of your own and prevent you from be joining the middle class which is why you went to school hoping to get into in the first place uh we never meant it to do that we're not going to collect it Argentina and the other countries can simply uh say we're not going to pay we're canceling the dollar debt uh and almost all of Argentina's debt by the way is not ow although it's denominated in dollars it's not owed to Americans to Dollar holders it's owed to what own wealthy class I know because uh I organized the first intern third world bond fund sovereign debt fund for Scutter Stevens in 1990 and the only place we could sell the third world debt that was paying 45% interest was in Brazil and Argentina where the heads of the Central Bank and the politicians all bought it because they knew they were going to pay it to themselves so we're dealing with h it's an easily solvable problem if it could be solved in 2500 BC in Sumer in 1800 BC by hamurabi in Babylonia and uh in 800 BC by the Assyrians obviously uh it can be solved just as easily today with all that said why do we have this widespread understanding that capitalism is by far the most effective and productive economic system considering what's going on as Richard mentioned inent and other countries where does it come from in your opinion Richard well I think you know the answer there I don't mean it to be simple-minded but I don't think it's all that uh complicated we we have um the United States is the Empire that emerged in the 20th century it replaced the old British Empire uh the British Empire prepared the way if if you like the United States inherited that Empire it developed the technology several steps further I don't want to take away my admiration for technological development particularly in communication and transportation and travel uh if I had to I'd pick out you know the Jet Engine and the internet as a way of Binding Together uh the world as a whole and so the United States is able to do globally what other Empires were moving towards but never could quite do and one of the Striking successes of the American Empire uh was the ability to shape Consciousness in other words to to do the work with the media with education uh to to Really inculcate in the people uh kind kind of new religion you know the old religions had been very successful Islam Judaism Christianity had done a good job in settling into the brains of their millions and people ways of thinking and organizing the world all of that had to be redone for modern capitalism and the United States has been an agent of doing that and it has been very successful even to this day the same people who answer a questionnaire about capitalism versus socialism when they finish answering the questionnaire saying that they're interested in socialism they will go out and purchase an Apple phone they will purchase jeans they will watch an American movie and in doing all of those things they will participate in a kind of celebration of all that comes with those items which is a a an ideology I am a I respect the power of ideology both in the past uh and in the present and and so I I do see Mr Zachariah and others like him as important people keeping alive even as the Empire declines keeping alive what they can the military prowess of the United States not looking real good the political dominance really bad the economic dominance troubled but the ideological dominance is still pretty strong and I can see the need to to build on that to celebrate that to to keep hyping the notion that what the United States is doing for example either in Ukraine or in helping Israel in Gaza is about human freedom I mean take a step back to describe those Horrors as exercises in spreading Freedom requires an ideological spect acular athleticism that you have to admire fortunately I've written all about this in my book Killing the ho uh what is capitalism uh I don't uh what we have today is not the capitalism that we had either when Richard and I went to school or in the 19th century the kind of capitalism that everyone was talking about in the 19th century uh both from Adam Smith and uh Ricardo through Marx and everyone else was industrial capitalism so the whole idea was when they talked about Capital they were talking about industrial Capital they weren't talking about landlord rent they weren't talking about monopolies they weren't talking about Finance Marx discussed this in volume two and three but he said I don't have to talk about rent and monopolies and finance because uh industrial capitalism is going to get rid of that in order to become a lowcost economy and in order to compete with other economies because the good thing about industrial capital ism is it's evolving into socialism that in order to be a successful industrial economy you need government to start by investing in infrastructure and then after you get rid of uh uh free lunch rent unearned income in real estate rent Monopoly rent and finance then you can get rid of exploitation finally in the last fight between industrial employers and wage earners which is what he he he was writing about what uh everyone else had already written about various forms of economic rent he was talking about that well the whole world seems to be going along the path of industrial capitalism to socialism in World War I socialism wasn't a bad word everybody was using them Social Democratic parties that were coming to power Germany was socialist uh America was moving towards socialism uh the last form of Socialism was going to be workers socialism but there was already socialism in terms of taking over the Comm what lenon called the commanding height uh the basic infrastructure that I talked about the the natural monopolies so uh what but what happened at since World War I is uh the United States won the war and uh really uh supervised not uh Finance capitalism and uh the great disaster that the United States did that poisoned the world economy and destroyed industrial capitalism occurred in the year that uh uh in 1913 the same year the income tax was developed by the Federal Reserve Bank on the one hand you had the income tax in America only falling on 1% of the people mainly the rich people who who owned uh real estate monopolies and finance uh but you had the Federal Reserve saying uh we want to take the most important driver of capitalism Finance out of the hands of treasuries and put it in the hands of the commercial Banks we're going to start central banks central banks is the fight of the monopolists against the government and if we can control the central bank and we're not going to let the treasury officials have any V any seat on the Central Bank board we're going to move the central banks out of Washington into the Financial Centers into New York Boston Chicago and uh we're we're finally going to have a totally free market we're going to get rid of government and everything that the government is doing and infrastructure to help people live inexpensively as a human right we can now charge them for and we can force them into death and we can control society and have uh we can re restore feudalism by by means of of a central bank taking the power of control away from government now if you're asking what has China done that it socialism was Chinese characteristics well it's socialism was 19th century capital was characteristic that kept the the power of money creation and credit Creation in the hands of the the Bank of China the the government so that when China creates credit it's to actually build houses and real estate uh Finance industry Finance uh industrial investment not to finance corporate takeovers uh not to create a financial bubble I mean right now it's trying to uh prevent another Financial bubble really taking place so uh what China is doing is exactly what the United States England Germany and France were trying to do and were developing successfully along before World War I China has picked up the lead and uh the United States has become uh a something that is the antithesis of industrial capitalism and that Finance capitalism another word for it is Neo feudalism so we're back with h what Richard points out the importance of a vocabulary and character help in shaping how people think about what is happening uh it's all about double think it's about control of the mass media and using the universities as a control of the uh uh the categories that people use to think like GDP or free market or Liberty uh if you can twist them around to me exactly the opposite uh then uh somehow you've got them in a quandry and uh they're frustrated and uh that's uh what today's politics is all about Nima let me give you a very concrete example here in the United States and in many other countries every working person that's the vast majority of people who are employees understand what I'm about to say when they cross the threshold into the factory or the office or the store where they work they no longer have Democratic rights they must do what some supervising person tells them to do sit over there use that computer process that paper in this manner do it for the next two hours then go to the bathroom you have four minutes then come back then you have a half an hour eat your sandwich then come back in other words for the next eight hours that you're there you are told what to do do you have any Democratic rights over the person telling you what to do answer no you have none you do not vote for that person you do not select that person you do not review that person you do not hire or fire that person quite the contrary they do that to you you do not do that to them in other words you know that you have absolutely no Democratic rights in the place where you spend 40 hours a week the best hours of five out of seven days of your adult life and yet you say that you live in you celebrate and you defend a democracy what in the world are you talking about there could be a democratic workplace of course they could all the people in a workplace could have one person one vote and they could decide what to produce how to produce where to produce and what to do with the output that would be a democratic workplace capitalism never ever establishes that capitalism thinks that that's weird or odd or out of place or unworkable or ridiculous but you have convinced people that can't capitalism equals democracy that the capitalist system that organizes its factories offices and stores in so obviously an undemocratic way is democracy well look Al this hus Huxley had nothing on us in 1984 the novel he wrote when he showed us how you can use words to mean the opposite of what they intended to specify in their original definitions but this is done systematically here in the United States it's just done and it's been done and again I take my hat off they've done that very well when I explain to students what I just explained here why capitalism is not only not Democratic but is the an antithesis of democracy it is an autocracy of the employer they nod their heads they understand I haven't persuaded them because they already know it they've already worked in a workplace or their mother has or their father has or their brother ha they know but the power of ideology is Extreme and has to be respected which is why what we're doing in talking about it is also very powerful well what you've described is called uh the pro uh professional managerial class EMC uh that word didn't exist when I was going to school uh it just made up for uh essentially a class of uh managers that uh make money uh it's very much I guess uh much more narrow than uh even the Soviet bureaucracy at least the Soviet bureaucracy provided housing entertainment and health care for its workers uh but the professional managerial class uh essentially uh St is the dress rehearsal for automatic intelligence uh I say automatic instead of artificial because artificial intelligence would at least be intelligent but automatic intelligence is like uh calling a calling a health Ider or a company to try to complain about something and you you get a press number one press number two everything is uh somehow computerized and uh uh you you'll now have the role of the professional managerial class being made by uh computers that are designed by uh people like Mr bessos that indeed will compute just uh uh how why you cannot take a bathroom break uh how how much of a adult man diaper uh you need to wear uh for every every uh six hours uh work and uh everything is going to be a stereotyped in a kind of control system the likes have uh really never uh been seen before probably not even in uh uh in slavery uh positions and the professional managerial class so far has been able to make its money by uh if you're at a university Dean for instance how do you make your money well how much can we lower the cost of paying professors and what we save the University in moving from full-time tenur professors to part- Tim that'll free up budget to pay ourselves more so you have the uh administrative professional managerial class of universities uh Rising uh and uh the content providers going down same thing if you look at a corporate balance sheet the the layers of Corporations assistance byp uh VP all of their people uh who are managing are getting more and more money by figuring out ways to to tight to raise productivity I mean how do when people quit how do we uh make the remaining workers work harder and pick up the slack instead of hiring more workers how do we uh how do we uh squeeze uh more out of them and uh whatever they can squeeze out of the workers they get to pay themselves that's sort of uh an intra wage earner class conflict and you were to talk to these people you know and say aan well you know you're a wage earner like we are I'm not a wage owner I'm professional managerial class even though they're getting a wage uh if for cheating the wage if for squeezing more money oh that's exploiting exploiting is a good word exploiting is considered uh something good when a company's sales is called the exploitation Department quite appropriately uh so uh you it's really becoming uh you have an exploitation exploitative class within uh the way Journey class uh that now is going to be replaced Itself by the automatic intelligence like uh uh you have a complaint go through the Eternal uh complaint on the cell phone that says uh I'm sorry coverage denied by your your pro your plan uh and people are lock why why do they consider uh keep working for a company like that well you can't say why don't you quit and mo change jobs well the other job would like it if you change jobs again you lose your Healthcare uh benefits you have to start all over again you lose anything you've been accumulating toward the pension you lose uh you you can't really go It Alone uh the way that the economy is structured uh the economy is structured to force you into a dependency situation and dependency is the key to exploitation
