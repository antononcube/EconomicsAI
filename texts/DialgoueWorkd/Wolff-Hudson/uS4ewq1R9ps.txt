[Music] what's your opinion on the China's economy right now is it getting better is it getting worse is it collapsing Michael well the what they say uh is getting worse is the financial situation uh China has uh sort of let a 100 flowers bloom 30 years ago uh and has F uh has basically left all of the localities uh to self- finance themselves and they financed themselves by selling real estate uh and China has uh let a real estate market develop largely by uh Bank credit not the central bank but by the Central Bank lending to uh local private banks that have uh essentially lent more and more money for apartments and uh a lot of these apartments uh have uh by the large companies have not been built uh and so the problem is what can China to do it has a choice it can either write down the debt uh and say okay uh we're just not going to charge the companies or it can dissolve them or it can uh restructure the companies or it can sell them to some uh another party like is happening in the United States uh somehow it obviously it must bail out the uh citizens that have made down payments for the apartments and uh now there are no Apartments uh uh to give them after the down payment China needs something like uh America's Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation except in this case it's an Insurance Corporation for uh victims of uh the mortgage mortgage credit system that is uh run way ahead of the uh of the building and the construction that's actually taking place obviously uh China has not uh uh done an adequate job of regulating the large construction companies so the volume of uh promises for apartments is way in excess of the actual number of apartments available that's pushed up housing prices and it's U it put a squeeze on uh many Chinese citizens so I think China now uh is in the discussion of how do they restructure the tax system between the federal government and the cities how do they restructure the local uh land tax system China owns all the land but it doesn't uh tax the uh local uh land value and uh as a result of not taxing this increasing value of land and property as housing goes up uh all this uh increasing purchasing power has been uh turned over to the banks as mortgage credit just is happening in the United States so China's let itself be sucked into the same Financial mortgage problem and tax problem that the United States is in and it really needs to have a few more Chinese characteristics uh to go with it socialism and Chinese characteristics it needs more Chinese characteristics less American Chicago School neoliberal characteristics richer yes I I I like very much what Michael had to say I think it captures uh the specifics of the moment so let me shift a little bit and talk about um you're introducing the notion that you get from certain of the coverage that this is a a matter of collapse the speed with which people have looked at the Chinese company Countryside and concluded that their economy is collapsing is is nothing short of breathtaking the Chinese economy's collapse has been predicted at least five times per month for the last 30 years um and you will therefore excuse people like me or you'll have to uh for being de deeply skeptical of yet another this is like the old crying wolf which I'm very sensitive to since my name is Wolf uh but I have to tell you that it is to use another uh simple language it is really uh and not much more than that um having said that let me go back to Michael nothing is more typical in the development of a capitalist economic system particularly given its unstable cyclical behavior that various sectors explode using credit or other mechanisms without any correlation with the other systems on which they depend so they become overdeveloped in one odd way than another and that requires either that you bring bring them back down to where everybody else is or you boost everybody else in order to catch up with them in order that the coordination the critics of capitalism have always understood that using phrases like capitalism is the Anarchy of the of production because all these decisions are made either by individual Enterprises or by Industries without the proper coordination except after the fact either by collapses or by Massive government interventions to which Michael made reference at the end of what he had uh to say and you know China is in an explosive period of growth there are few examples in the history of capitalism where any kind of country has grown that fast uh over time to that extent and they're going to have these kinds of problems uh because of the way they've organized their economy to this point letting a large number of private Enterprises function uh function in the way they normally do with adjustment and correlation happening after the fact not as part of a plan not that plans avoid all unexpected events no planning can do that but it would be a big step forward they've chosen to allow a large part of their economic activity to happen either at decent centralized levels or in the private sector in an economy that's virtually 5050 private public and so they're going to have these kinds of experiences this is not the first one and this will not be the last one they may they may take the the the step that Michael advises them and borrow from other countries that have gone through comparable circumstances uh or they may you know develop an FDIC for the for the the buyer of rental property and so forth um My Hope Is they ask more profound questions I don't know well enough whether that's in the cards but ask about whether the basic structure of the system they've put together even though it has many achievements to point to also leaves them vulnerable to several dysfunctions of the sort we're discussing now and maybe that ought to be a provocation to ask basic questions about what they're doing as their socialism with Chinese characteristics yeaha uh I think uh asking that question would lead them to say have the following uh discussion should we let the private Banks go under that have made these bad loans uh we tried to see let a 100 flowers bloom let's see what the private sector can do well it's done exactly what Richard uh described it's followed uh the finance capitalist path well uh bad loans uh let them all go under we will guarantee the small depositors uh up to you know whatever they figure a normal uh family should have let the banks go under and say uh I guess uh that shows that we really need to keep banking is a socialist function that's why we call it socialism with Chinese characteristics not Finance capitalism with Chinese characteristics uh and I think that's the big decision the other question is uh whether they uh what to do with all of these half-built buildings I don't know what to do I don't know whether there's been overbuilding for the market I don't know whether there's uh any audience for the buildings uh that have been built in the places they're uh built up there has to be some kind of feedback as to what localities need what system but ultimately uh what is led to this whole Reliance on the private sector is the fiscal relation between the federal government and the localities I think there has to be a Chinese version of what in America is called Revenue sharing the federal government has to work with the localities so that they do not Finance their local budgets of local communities by selling off the real estate to private developers uh this is the What's Happening Now is the result of that uh there has to be a coordination between local and uh uh Federal uh uh F fiscal policy and the government uh should be able to provide the localities with what they both agree is needed without forcing a selloff and a privatization of land otherwise you're doing uh you're you're just creating uh the kind of collapse that is uh is occurring today and you don't want to recreate the same problem let me add yeah a couple things um first to what Michael says there are many examples in in the West in regular private or mostly private capitalism in which comparable breakdowns of the link between finance and one or another industry a non-financial industry goes screwy and then the government steps in and tries to do what the private sector couldn't or wouldn't do uh and so if it were to go in the direction that Michael suggests there actually are plenty of experiments in the west upon which to draw and I'll mention only two of them one was the decision by the Socialist government in France when franois meon came into Power one of the first things he did was take over half a dozen of the major private banks in France and convert them into government operations and he did that around the notion which is consistent with what Michael says uh that the government should be the determinant of where credit flows what industries need to get it so they can grow what industries need to lose it so they can consolidate etc etc and that this power that the government will control where investment goes is necessary to stabilize French e economics and to make France a real competitor for the leadership of the European economy because it's in struggle with Britain which was on the way down but with Germany which was on the way up and they had to navigate where they would end up the French caught as they were between those two which is an old part of that history but they might learn very valuable lessons from what was and was not achieved by that uh and they might also learn the lesson that the major priority of the of the banking sector and the capitalist class in France after that was to reverse that action and get rid of Mr metol both of which they did the second example is the United States one of our states North Dakota long ago got rid of a ma of the major dependence on banking most of which was outside of North Dakota anyway um and they develop their own bank the Bank of North Dakota it's a publicly owned bank it basically Services the people and businesses of North Dakota they in turn put their deposits into that bank um the whole thing operates at a low profit level way below what private Banks do what profit it makes is returned to the budget of the state of North Dakota and therefore in a sense lowers the taxes that would otherwise have to be raised from the people and businesses it's a kind of a win-win which is why Republicans and Democrats alike in the government of North Dakota have never dared interfere with it it's over a hundred years old uh it did not collapse in 2008 and n it did not need a bailout from uh the government of the United States the way every private uh Bank every major private bank did so you you can see there are precedents all over the place uh you don't even have to call it socialism and just speaking personally I'm dubious about doing all of that although I understand the history behind it and obviously it's it's the perfect right of the Chinese to call their system whatever they want um here's what what I'm me though when I said ask deeper questions I agree the coordination between the center and the decentered government is crucial and will be for a long time in China but there's this deeper question of how you organize the activity we call Banking and credit nothing is more social in the capitalist system than money the reason we have slogans like money makes the world go around and money is because we kind of all understand that money is absolutely crucial all the time everywhere in this system so why in the world would you leave it in the hands of Institutions who tell you that they're in this business to maximize the private profit of their institution why would you organize something as social as money in that form and that's what I hoped for they would open the question why are we doing this why are we arranging that a bank has a core of people at the top the board of directors the the top executive whatever you want to call them a tiny group presiding over a large mass of employees you know loan officers banking clerks all of that uh and run it in this way full of full of antagonism between the top and the bottom the inequality of their situation promotes every kind of of violence of of cheating of crooked activity which we're catching in all banks all the time anyway maybe you ought to rethink the whole private social Divergence is that something you picked out to could hold on to capitalism to some degree but out of a logic that said you had to do that I'm not saying that that's wrong but I am saying that ought to be interrogated that ought to be debated we ought to have that kind and the and at the same time why are we organizing our Enterprises the way we are why if it's socialism with Chinese characteristics might that not question the employer employee relationship why are we organizing our businesses banking or otherwise this way maybe we oughtn't to maybe a compromise would be if the society is full of the need to cooperate in order to have any Community maybe that would be good inside the Enterprise too especially if it's a socially focused Enterprise the way the management of money has to be those are the questions I thought or I would add to what Michael says that this crisis would provoke and I do believe that if this crisis provokes that it will have the good sign in other words it'll be the good part of a crisis the part that makes you rethink how you got yourself into this crisis so you don't do it again well I've had professorships at a number of Chinese universities and I've asked exactly the question that Richard just asked why are they doing things the way they're doing privatization and uh I've got the same answer everywhere that they send their economic students to the United States to take economics courses to be trained and uh they uh when the Chinese students get back to China those who studied in the United States are given priority over those who have uh studied in China uh and what do they study in China uh they do study uh Marxism and uh socialism but only volume one of capital and uh I find out that uh very few have read volumes two and three of capital where March discusses uh finance and uh rent primarily and uh uh friends of mine uh have other professors have made exactly the same question now I think is finally the time that they're going to ask uh Richard's question why are we doing things the way the United States uh uh does it uh they have a golden opportunity it's very it's very hard to change in existing system and all of a sudden uh take the existing Banks and just sort of restructure them but China has a golden opportunity in uh the U Financial uh crisis right now it can let these uh private Banks go under and then say well of course we're not going to let the regular depositors suffer uh we're going to uh make all of the positive uh real economic uh uh functions of a bank work but we're not going to uh bail out the big depositors uh who uh there's no reason to give them we're not going to uh bail out the wealth of the bank owners uh because they owned something that went broke and so we're going to do just what Milton fredman uh would say we're gonna let the magic of the marketplace clear everything uh and that's going to caim uh clear the road for what they can do uh is socialism uh you mentioned public banking in South Dakota uh the O uh that's certainly uh a better idea for uh governments to keep their money in a government Bank the one thing that uh the Bank of North Dakota can't do is create enough money to fund all of the uh public uh uh public uh spending only the federal government is empowered to create money either by the treasury uh or by the the Federal Reserve uh the good thing about China is it doesn't have have a Federal Reserve Bank it doesn't have a central bank basically it has the Bank of China but that's really like the treasury it's an arm of the government it's not a a central bank that's run on behalf of the commercial Banks to act as lobbyists so China can write down uh the debts and save the banks and let let the banks go under without really having uh any vested interest to fight back such as would occur in the United States uh so that the good side it has a free reign right now to do whatever it wants to do the kind of policies that Richard has explained uh France is certainly a wonderful example of doing this uh you don't want to privatize finance and the one thing that has made shiny socialism so successful so different from uh the capitalist road is it's kept money creation as a public utility it has not privatized it well now that it's keeping money creation is a private utility The Logical conclusion is to spread this to the whole financial system and make the whole financial system basically uh public utility uh certainly in terms of the supply of uh the supply of credit and the oversight so uh I would hope that they're asking the same question that Richard has posed uh and uh with a wider uh uh set of solutions then what would the American economic professors tell our students to do yeah again I mean Michael and I are I don't know enriching each other's presentations and maybe that's what you were looking for and and I'm enjoying it and I'm learning so I'm happy with it but in that vein uh let me just suggest the the reason that so many Chinese students and since both Michael and I have been economics professors most of our adult life I've had a whole series of students from China in my classes uh for years now and and I have them now too I teach at the new school University in New York City and and there Chinese visiting students there uh Etc and and I've always been struck that when I ask you know why are you here you know what exactly do you think you're going to learn here in the United States since I'm a a a product I was about to say victim but I'm a product of American University economics education um and and what comes out after years is is roughly the following the United States is the great example of capitalist success China wants to piggy back and learn what it can from that success I you know there's a logic there it makes a certain sense there will be things like that that they can learn but I find the irony of it to go now the other way in the last few years the rate of growth in China far exceeds that of the United States been true for a generation now no sign of it ending even in this crazy uh post-pandemic year the projection of GDP growth in the US is 2 and a half% and the projection in China 5 and a half percent that's pretty pretty close to the three to one average that we've had uh on and off for 30 25 30 years so my guess is we're seeing the end of the migration of Chinese students here and we're seeing the beginning of the migration in exactly the opposite direction and for the same reasons the world wants to figure out how to do what the Chinese did every country of Asia Africa Latin America Eastern Europe in short the poorer countries of the world one of whose top priorities is to stop being one of the poorer countries of the world are looking at one of the poorest watched what it did watch what it's doing and when you wonder where to send your students now we're going to see and so I think this is about it it was the right comment for Michael to make But the irony is it's coming just at the Reflection Point when things are going to go the other way Richard put his finger on exactly the problem what was the period of America's success it was the 19th century it was the late 19th century protectionism uh High wages uh and the it was the business schools and the industrialists that said we need government to run basic infrastructure we need government to Bear the costs of H Communications transportation Public Health Water and Sewer because if uh we don't have the government do it it'll be run by monopolies and they'll charge high prices and we'll have to pay our labor higher higher wages uh just to pay monopolists and uh they actually did want to pay American higher wages if they made labor more productive that was the the Golden Age of American success leading up to H World War one but uh now when they're try they're doing what they think is ulating American success they're emulating American collapse that's what they're taught in the universities that uh the neoliberal uh collaps is financialization is the way to go you don't need industry you don't need to pay wages and if there the solution to any problem is to reduce labors wages and living standards that's what they they're taught in the United States that's not a success that's how America's de-industrialized so that's exactly the the the the semantic uh trap that they're in they don't they picked the wrong period for America's success and they're choosing America's failure instead of success to emulate I hope they're disabused of that well you know it's their Marxism I say that tongue and cheek Marx is famous for his concept of uneven development and what Michael just said is that there's no evenness in the United States and China's relationship it is a study in uneven development which includes the bizarre focusing of a student generation on a period that's over just when you need it to be helpful for a period That's just beginning and on and on I mean it doesn't mean it won't continue but it's Marx himself who taught that these things are going to happen unevenly as it is by the way with the housing problem inside China that's another uneven development classic Bally appropriate to what remains at least in part a capitalist situation well Richard you and I have got to bring Marxism to China well I I can tell you many times I've had both from Eastern European students and from Chinese students they come up to me at the end of classes because I've been teaching marxian economics pretty much my whole adult life and they they say to me very politely and very friendly that they never heard this stuff before so I whatever it is that that is understood and taught as Marxism over there is at least in many ways quite different from what we do here and again that shouldn't surprise anyone but it takes you back to Michael's point maybe the Marxism you need to study is the Marxism now critical of the United States because of the failures here the mounting failures here um rather than a Marxism of another period which was oriented differently because the situation at that time was different but not only volume one that you have to read volume two and three and a series of surplus value yeah let me comment on that for a minute uh that's important and let me make it personal I used to teach The Graduate course at the University of Massachusetts Amherst which was an unusual place just as the university uh in Kansas City where Michael was was a similarly unusual place um and I taught it first volume one because that's what students wanted and students wanted that because they didn't have any idea what was in volumes 2 and three and it became very clear to me that they would never never Embrace or be able to use the marxian apparatus if they didn't know what was in volumes 2 and three because they would then be set out trying to square a circle that is volume one of capital together with conventional you know uh neoclassical economics when it comes to what Marx called the distributions of the Surplus I mean to be crude volume one is about the production and appropriation of the Surplus by the two great classes workers and employers but volumes two and three is how that Surplus moves around into whose hands do the appropriators put it they put it in the hands of what he calls money lending capitalists or what we would nowadays call you know Credit Systems or Bankers or intermediaries like that and then in volume three uh he expands on all of that and talks about the landowning class the ronier you know Marx talks about joint stock Capital C you don't need neoclassical economics to deal with all of those other issues Marx wasn't an idiot he knew about joint stock companies he knew about Bankers how could you not given his so it was always a terrible lapse in America's education in marxan that the few people relatively speaking who studied Marx studyed one volume the production of the Surplus without understanding that to understand the system you need to see how the Surplus circulates around the economy how Enterprises manage the problems of circulation without which they die they have to manage production but they have to manage the circulation and that brings in these other people these money lending capitalists and these landlord capitalists and and and the merch capitalist Marx has an a wonderful analysis in volume three that will help you understand Walmart in a way you never otherwise could it's the capture of a disproportionate amount of surplus if the distributor the merchant can grab hold of the production system and squeeze it and he shows you how that's done so it's very important for those listening who might be students or thinking about coming students that the if you want to use Marxism as the enormously valuable tool tool that it is not the only tool not exclusive of others but as part of your apparatus then you really need to read and think about all that is done in volume two and three I guarantee you will not think about Finance or rent or any or joint stock company or anything like that uh in the same way once you see how Marx integrates that with the analysis of the Surplus well that's ex uh my solution to that problem when I was teaching at the new school in uh the 1970s was to uh real to teach uh Marx in the context of classical political economy because Marx was the last classical Economist uh until he wrote uh the whole focus of uh of industrial capitalism as he wrote uh in the Communist manifest of capitalism was revolutionary and it was revolutionary by getting rid of the landlord class you don't need a landlord class they just increase the rents uh and you get rid of the uh predatory banking class that he talked about in volume three now uh Mark said I he didn't have to write about uh the ex the economic rent of uh the ronier class he didn't have to write about the landlord's uh land rent because Adam Smith and Ricardo and John Stuart Mill had written about that he didn't there was already a massive criticism of banking but what marks added to classical economics was saying uh we know that landlords and banks are exploitative and rent Seekers but industrialism is also an exploitation of Labor that's what Marx added to classical economics but he assumed that are the industrial uh capitalist class was going to solve the problem of getting rid of the landlords and making banking uh socializing Banking and socializing land ownership and so what he wanted to do was after the classical economists have done their work uh then now we have to deal with the labor Capital relations and uh as it turned out he was much more optimistic of capitalism than matters uh Justified the the landlords fought back the bankers fought back and uh they denied the whole concept of economic rent they said they rejected Adam Smith they rejected Ricardo they rejected all of the free market economists and so now if you take a class in a uh today uh in econ graduate economics there's no history of economic thought it's wiped out because they don't want to talk about the concept of economic rent and there's no exploitation that's the basic Assumption of neoliberal Economics nobody's exploited everybody earns whatever wealth they have they're a billionaire they earn it that and that's the policy that uh Adam Smith didn't have Ricardo have John Stewart Mill didn't have and if you put marks in the context of realizing what I went before him and what he added to then you've got the big picture uh so you can't only teach Marx uh when I was teaching Marxism at the new school I had them read Adam Smith and Ricardo malus and the whole discussion that led up to Marks yeah you know this is charming for us to do yeah early new school later New School uh but I again I I I'm taking aack at the similarities that that Michael experienced and my own experience it reminds me of a of a joke it was called political economy and then at the end of the 19th century terrified by the challenge that Marx's development and the Marxism particularly in Germany was having uh you had this so-called revolution in France in in the French speaking English speaking and uh German speaking parts of Europe jevans manger valra all of them they they go backwards but they like so often when you go backwards you want to hide it from yourself so they called what they were doing neoc classical economics they wanted to hold on to the classical tradition but only a name it's like the state in which I live most of my life the state of Connecticut the name is is from the Native indigenous people every every remnant of them has been wiped out in the state of Connecticut with the exception of a casino you know which which is kind of a horrific joke but you hold on to the name of the people you have exterminated there's something deeply sick in all of this and there is in economics too this bizarre we are neoc classical no you're not you're a retreat from what the classicals did you don't even achieve what they did you know at the beginning of Smith and Ricardo's books it says we're trying to understand the division of the output the income into the three great classes no neoclassical book starts like that they don't want to understand the relationship between Capital labor and and land which was the problem for them they didn't make clear as Michael correctly said that we're are here to celebrate one of these three and to really squeeze out the other two well the irony is that it was thorstein beIN I think that coined the term Leo neoclassical and uh as Richard points out that led to all this confusion what he what beelin meant to say uh and normally he's a very good writer what he meant to say is uh they've rejected classical economics and now this uh junk economics this strip down uh anti-classical economics is the new mainstream economics but instead of calling it the new mainstream economics he called it the neoclassical economics and that's what led to so much confusion uh and but uh Richard is absolutely right neoclassical economics is anti-classical economic because it rejects the value price and rent Theory and all of the uh British political economy was about value and price and price was the excess of uh uh of rent unearned income over an above the actual cost of production and Mark said the uh the aim of industrial capitalism is to reduce uh prices to the cost of production get rid of the parasitic landlord class get rid of the parasitic B banking and the way to do that is industrial capitalism is going to evolve into socialism well that's why people that's why they banned the study of March because of Mark if you understand classical economics uh there by the 19th century everybody thought capitalism was evolving into socialism and that's exactly what uh the discussion by before World War I was what kind of socialism is it going to evolve into uh and that's exactly the discussion that should take place uh in China today but is not taking place in American universities or european universities you know if we had time Michael and I I suspect could could give you a lecture that one of the greatest of the neoc classical Economist not well known in the United States was a an Austrian named burm B he had a hyphenated last name and he is the one who made Michael's Point crystal clear a 100 years ago he explained how and why neoclassical economics is the reputation of Marx uh he then made a a logical mistake and thought he could locate it in the relationship between values and prices that's another conversation that took people into a boring endless literature on that subject to which I must admit I have also contributed but I I understand that it was a diversion it Marx called it what what what uh um Vin didn't Marx called this stuff vulgar economics that was his phrase and if if you ever have the chance and I'm speaking here obviously to the audience I hope is watching if you pick up the early chapters of volume two of capital it's a discussion there of what they call the circuits of capital but if you read it properly it is it Marx shows you how depending on which of these circuits you focus on you will get neoclassical economics you will get ricardian economics you will you get the and he's literally conducting a critique in those opening chapters of what has happened to the economics profession and why and how they're different from what he's trying to do and it'll show you what Mar what Michael just said but within the context it's like reading the the volumes called theories of surplus value the other three volumes of Marx where he has all his notebooks of when he read Adam Smith and he read Ricardo and the others and the extensive critique there's very few economists in the history of the profession whoever did this kind of detailed work on everybody who came before them in fact other than the the famous Harvard Professor Schumer I don't know of anyone who did that uh and certainly not on the scale that either Shum or Marx did the notion that economics is a discipline so that you can entitle your book economics like most textbooks are is an attempt to fudge the fundamental difference and hostility of the different Traditions one for the other and you do nobody a favor by fudging all of that when you look at the China's economy today how much capitalist is that is it getting more socialist is it getting more capitalist well what you're asking is the question that everyone was talking about a hundred years ago what kind of socialism are we going to have uh and the essence of socialism that uh there was Christian socialism there was uh marxian socialism there was libertarian socialism but what everybody agreed upon is that basic needs basic infrastructure should be in the public domain uh natural monopolies should be in the public domain if you didn't have health care and education provided freely to the population then workers would have to pay for them in in order to get by and if they had to pay for them that would increase the wages that employers would have to pay and if you want to make a competitive capitalist system you need to socialize uh certainly basic needs like education and uh uh Healthcare uh and it was the conservatives that said said this uh in England it was Israel Israeli that said uh health health is all he was their prime minister uh and and the other thing that needed to be socialized were basic monopolies like communication is a monopoly transportation is a monopoly water and sewers are a monopoly you can't have competing buildings and if you leave these in private hands you end up with Margaret thatches England you end up with Ronald Reagan's America you you all of a sudden privatize everything and uh you you end up with uh doing to yourself what the World Bank and the international monetary fund has done to wreck third world countries to uh prevent them from socializing by uh privatizing everything mainly in the hands of foreign monopolists and passing an international law saying that if they do socialize uh these functions to make a competitive economy they have to pay a compensation to the colonizers in other words they're you you've made Latin America Africa and Asia in the position of Haiti when it had the revolution against France you have to pay for the next two centuries to get your freedom from the financial cramel of our our financial colonization that we've mounted in order to prevent you from having socialism uh you have to realize the dynamic that uh uh industrial capitalism has failed in its Destiny to become socialism it's reverting to Feud ISM it's created a landlord class again it's created a predatory banking class we're going back to feudalism not forward to socialism that's the failure of industrial capitalism and it's the job of China and other countries to uh overcome this failure and say uh we realize the West has taken a wrong uh Road and uh we're going to pick up uh where World Civilization seemed to be uh going at the time was interrupted by World War I afterward you had the world so the West so traumatized by the Russian Revolution that it became uh vehemently anti-socialist and uh unproductive and the end of that has been the de-industrialized polarized economy that you see in the United States today well you know again I agree with what Michael is saying but I just want to push the argument for me and this is just you know for me for me socialism includes um beyond the public private issue very important issue but beyond that the micro level issue how do you organize Collective labor how do you organize the workplaces where goods are produced or goods are distributed services are produced distributed and so on if you organize them in what I take to be the classic capitalist way and I only give them that label because we call that period in Europe after the end you know the Renaissance is behind us feudalism is over something happens in England and spreads from there to become Global and for me that something is the organization of the workplace into employer employee and you can call that labor power a commodity you can call it many different names but that's for me the essence and it's what distinguishes the preceding period which we capture with Lord and Surf and all that that implies which distinguishes it from another period which we call Master and slave and all that that implies for me then socialism is the rejection of all of those all of those dichotomized or what Marx called class divided societies Labor uh Master Slave Lord surf employer employee with that in my mind I want I think that the solution the socialism we need is a socialism that undertakes the radical step of saying we are not going to organize workplaces with that dichotomy we're not going to have a small group of people running the show when no Masters no Lords no employers when Marx occasionally uses the phrase classless society it's something like that he's gesturing toward no classes I take that literally I I take that as as hard idea we're going to or organized world and I want to note that that the desire to do that is as old as human history human beings have collectively formed groups that are equal one with the other that are egalitarian that share the decision making that's not a new idea that's not a a a product only of capitalism you have communities that tried to do that in feudalism in slavery in ancient Villages which often were or organized that way etc etc I think that is now coming back and becoming in the way Marx foresaw as a communism but now one for modern society different from but learning from the ancient communes that remember that's the root of that word Community communism communal communitarian it's all about all the efforts human beings did for me if if China is going to be the step Next Step which in many ways it already is it is a it's different from the Soviet experiment it's different from Scandinavian socialist experiment it has its own Chinese characteristics but I want to see it engage with what I'm saying in terms of going that next step well Richard you've uh talked about this more than anybody else I know and you've elaborated it and this is exactly uh the whole point what uh why do we want socialism we want uh better a better life and most people's life is connected to their working conditions uh and right now uh all of the uh polls show among American workers show people are unsatisfied with their jobs they're they're not contributing to it they're uh What uh thoran velin called industrial sabotage the workers are just uh giving as little as they can and very resentful uh and uh the system is what uh my friend David Graber just published the book uh published the book jobs that's what people feel their jobs are today and that's that's exactly the point what's the point of having socialism for just what Richard's talking about yeah yeah and I think people wonder they describe me I don't know if it's or not but they describe me as quote unquote optimistic my answer is I look around the society I'm perfectly willing to be prepared to see the negatives all around me and there are plenty of them but for the same reason as what Michael just said I am optimistic I think let's put it this way being the product of the universities I went to here in the United States my personal friends and the Associates include people who now run the United States economy and I you know I know them we have coffee from time to time and I can assure you in case you're wondering they are very very worried one of the few things we can all agree on as we gather around the table drinking coffee or drinking wine we don't agree on how the US got itself into this situation we don't agree on how it should get out of it but here's what we Amaze ourselves by agreeing on the following sentence this is the worst condition of the American economy in our lifetime and you can see from the color of the hair both Michael and I have that we've been around a long time so that's that is something to say they're not so confident we're more confident than they are about the future and that says as much as any piece of of analysis we could offer you so we're optimistic because we're saying it's all going to collapse that's our optimism to them that's pessimism to us it's optimism yeah and that there are some there are some movements that we can put some hope in you know my family is French and so my family participated in a movement over the recent time called the jileon in French which stands for yellow vest and I'm sure you all saw that this is a massive outpouring of the people of France who are giving the middle finger to their government with enthusiasm Mr mcon has the level of popularity that Mr Biden does or Mr Trump does or less than that the reality is people around the world are looking at the economic system we call capitalism and they're exuding deep dis pleasure that's why they vote for clowns like Trump or clowns like the fellow who won in Netherland in Netherlands or the fellow who won in Argentina and I could go on these are not signs of a healthy Dynamic Growing System these are people coming in saying it's a mess that we have here vote for me I'll fix it and people are so desperate that they'll actually give it to that kind of a clown knowing in their soul this is going nowhere fast we we are witnessing the United States economic War in China she in his last meeting with Biden he tried to solve the situation he tried to describe to Biden that we can cooperate instead of going to war against each other how capable is the United States to harm the China's economy and bring it down I don't think it's so much a war is a a splitting a part of the world in a war people actually have contact with each other and fight each other America is not fighting China it's going its own way it's isolating China and it's it isolating Iran it's isolating South America it's isolating the entire world against itself so it's ultimately isolating itself uh it's going its own way and the rest of the world is going its way not a war we're just seeing two different paths the US and its uh European satellites uh and you can see what it's done to England and Germany uh you don't want to be a satellite but uh they're going their way and the rest of the world now is going uh uh saying well how do we restructure a world we don't just change the market we need a whole different set of Institutions we need our own world bank with a different philosophy we need our own international monetary fund with a different Financial philosophy we need our own Trade Organization we finally need an international criminal court uh to deal with the American terrorism uh we need uh there's there's a whole new uh parallel universe a socialist universe that uh in principle that's being created and it's not a war it's just going to leave the United States isolated uh that's that's my view yeah I think that's what's going on I agree with it um the only thing I would add is that there is a kind of Precedence that I would in voke I bit I understand it's a bit of a stretch on the other hand I think it has something to teach us back in the 18th century the United sta the development of what was then a British colony reached a point where the colonists were prepared and willing to fight a war to break away from the parent colonial power Britain and they fought a war and the British thought it was amusing George III sitting in in London uh thought this was amusing sent his military to take care of this problem the way the military had taken care of comparable problems in other parts of the empire for centuries I'm thinking particularly of the Indian subcontinent but elsewhere too I look at what was done to Ireland I mean and on and on the to the amazement the the rag tag George Washington Army defeated the British not content to to understand what this meant the British tried again in 1812 Another War and they lost that one too at which point I think an idea settled into the minds of enough Britain at the top of their society to change their policy they could not stop what was going on they couldn't so they better learn to live with it they accommodated the United States which then proceeded to prove that they couldn't stop it because the United States simply caught up to and eventually surpassed the British the relationship of big and little was reversed the little became the big the big became the little and it's been more and more of that ever since okay so we we know but there's the precedent you tried militarily to stop it you failed twice maybe the smart thing would not be to go through two lost Wars especially now that they can be nuclear from which we all cannot Escape etc etc I think somewhere even in the unconscious that story reverberates in the minds uh of people now and I think the evidence is overwhelming it is too late if it was ever possible you cannot put the genie back in the bottle China has shown it cannot only grow faster year and year out through crashes through pandemics doesn't seem to matter unbelievable record that they've a uh uh accomplished but it takes us all the way to the top of the of the technology chain they have the equivalent of apple and Intel and Google and all the rest of it they've been able to do that in recent months they've been able to demonstrate even when you specifically go after uh semiconductor chips and you you squash the company Huawei and you do this and you do that it still doesn't work and they announced a few weeks ago and they showed the world they have their own chip they can manage an Apple telephone or it's equ equivalent no need for the all you've done is you've ironically in the irony of of what Michael just said you've demonstrated that if your enemy is a powerful Communist party in state able to manage this bizarre hybrid of private and public Enterprises to to identify and go get targeted priority Industries if that's their strength and you block them from certain technology in your country they're going to take their strength and deal with what you can't taken away from them and they're going to show you up because they're going to do it quicker and faster which is by now their motus opendi you should have foreseen that you idiot you know I I can see a Biden well not him but someone like him calling in the advisors and saying you know uh Jack what are you telling us here what you're proposing is a strategy they're equipped to defeat and as if that weren't enough xiin p and others have said this publicly they've said it that's where I got it from you know this is don't do this this this is going to make you more upset we're GNA beat you at this why don't we work together share the technology you'll go there we'll go there and you we what you're doing this aggressive as Michael puts it isolation that's a much more dangerous path in the direction of War because you're going to become more and more frustrated that's already happening leading to the crazies in this country who want to go to war because they see we're losing the alternative you know wouldn't that be enough to change your trajectory well my answer is we don't know we don't know how this is going to play out inside the United States we don't know how this experience of slipping let me remind you of us statistic before the the 2020 the GDP of the G7 that's the US and its major allies was higher if you add it all up than the GDP of China and its allies in the bricks since 2020 it's reversed now in 2023 total out share of total output of the G7 in the world 29% share of the bricks before the addition of the six new bricks company countries before that in 2023 the original bricks 33% of world output it's over it's over and it not getting better Germany's going into recession as we speak Britain is already in one even though its numbers mask that a little bit and the United States expects one according to J JP Morgan Chase Jamie Diamond testimony yesterday say uh we're heading towards a recession again so this situation is getting worse and worse and they are going to be voices in the United States who can't possibly admit or recognize what we're talking about as the reasons for it they're GNA blame China because that's what they're good at and they're gonna want to go bomb something which is also what they thought they were good at and in case you do dubious let let me be aggressive with you the United States has lost the war in Korea the war in Vietnam the war in Afghanistan the war in Iraq and now the war in Ukraine that's not a pretty record they've held on to illusions of power through a series of defeats that ought to make you stop and take a deep breath as to the level of self- delusion that this Society is capable of well there we go Richard so let's give the Biden Administration and the Trump Administration credit for uh doing what they've done to help catalyze this uh you're absolutely right whenever you impose a sanction on other countries uh for something they need whether it's sanctions on food or sanctions on technology you leave them no alternative but to protect to create their own uh industry but the problem was that China and Russia had sent their students to the United States and they believed in free trade and the only way you can make sure that you can nurture their own food production in Grain production in Russia or uh Tech high technology in China is protective tariffs but they weren't doing this because they were members of the uh World Trade Organization and so uh Trump and Biden have said look we're gonna help you we're gonna help you do just what the United States did in the 19th century we're going to have protective tariffs and if you won't do it you know we'll just put sanctions on you and we'll sort of force you to develop and go your own own way because we really want to nurture uh uh let a hundred countries Bloom with their own way of doing things so I think we should applaud that yeah yes absolutely yeah the the ironies you know you need a be toold PR or some other great uh uh comedy writer to capture because in in all this sad and dangerous material there lies a fantastically funny sequence of Mumble Bumble mistakes and the it's just it's amazing and and it'll provide you with nothing else at least a little comic relief to what otherwise might be pretty bleak daily news reports how do you see the future of Europe I think that both Richard and I would call ourselves materialists uh and there's one problem with the materialist approach to history Marxism and socialism you expect other countries to act in their own self-interest Europe has committed economic suicide Europe is dead EUR uh uh German industry is uh moving to America or to other countries to China uh BASF the chemical company said well now that we can't uh have inexpensive energy we have to move to China uh the uh European leadership uh is not European it's basically nurtured and protected by Americans who interfered with European politics ever since 1945 through non-governmental organizations through bribery and uh American officials uh Finance Department officials have told me that all they need to do is give the Europeans little white envelopes uh the EUR they tell me the Europeans are even more corruptible than the Latin Americans uh for and the Europeans have agreed to commit economic suicide on behalf of the United States so that's dead America uh and it was smart enough to real realiz exactly what Richard and I were talking about that the growth area of uh the world is uh the Shanghai cooperation organization the belt and Road initiative of China and uh I mean China Russia Iran uh the whole group and if you believe what Richard KN saying then the problem is how do we keep control what can we control if the whole world's getting uh more productive and we're so eager to fight against labor so eager to make the last war uh de-industrialized by moving our uh labor abroad uh how are we going to keep control of Europe well the solution is to what blow up the northstream pipeline uh energy is needed for industry uh German Industries ended German uh because you need uh energy to make GDP growth uh it's basically you need energy for product labor productivity uh all that is ended so the Americans saw it and the Europeans utterly corrupt were were bought out except for hungry and uh ironically it's the right-wing parties that are explaining all this the Socialist parties what is called socialism there is really the rightwing and what's called the the rightwing it seems to be a thing what uh we all would have expected the leftwing to say so uh if you there's no way of explaining what's happening today on the grounds of self-interest in the west you you have uh basically what would Spangler have called it the decline of the West and uh is opposed to the rest so uh I'm very pessimistic about Europe and so are the Europeans that's why they're leaving that uh I see the Euro going down and down again against the dollar because the Euro was basically Germany's export Surplus it doesn't have an export Surplus anymore uh it's it's broke and breaking Germany has broken up the whole European economy and they're applauding it applauding it yeah again I would only add I find it amazing watching what we're seeing in Europe um I'm a little nervous about the materialist I I understand what Michael is doing but um there is a core of the European capitalist class that has identified with its alliance with the United States for so long that really they can't think outside of that box the United States is their ultimate protector um the United States is the wonderful assistant who keeps the Russians at Bay on one hand and their own working class on the other and and that that's a wonderful assist that capitalist classes don't normally have that uh they have it they've got the United States that saves them from having to spend all the money on military preparedness they might otherwise have to spend the United States and them have been fighting about that for literally 50 years every American president bemon that the Europeans don't do their share of the common defense costs that's a real index of some tension not enough to split them uh and so they each feel we're getting an advantage Europe is a buffer for the United States the United States is a Defender for Europe but the danger of that is what they're now done I mean the Germans needed two things once they accomplished the unification with East Germany and that was already done 10 15 years ago they needed a pro they had a problem because they were so successful because they were the engine of the European e economy they needed more labor once the Eastern EUR Germans were used up and they needed cheap energy and the constant bringing in of of uh immigrants I want to remind you the end of Angela Merkel was when she came out publicly and said we could use a million or two immigrants at that point the German working class said to her no you don't we know what you're doing you're bringing in you know cheap labor and we're not going to let you do that and okay as long as the cheap gas and oil came from Russia they could work their way around it when the Ukraine war breaks out and they the war by the way is not the problem it's the sanctions that are the problem the war who gives a crap the war is only horrible for the people of Ukraine and the soldiers that are that are lost in that uh crazy thing but this is the end of Germany if it doesn't have cheap energy and it can't get cheap labor then the so-called uh V how you say it in German what's the TR the the the economic Miracle the so-called of Germany dissolves it's no Miracle at all cheap labor and cheap energy for a country that wants to be an export Powerhouse you know the first grade learns that little lesson if you can get yourself in that situation you'll be the big Powerhouse but you the the the flip side if you lose cheap labor and you lose cheap energy you're going to be what Germany is now and nobody's picking up the slack the British economy that's a bad joke the French economy the French are geniuses they Slither through between the oil and gas they can get from North Africa and the and the tourist Goods they produce for the rich of the world they they muddle through and and the rest is chaos I mean I don't mean to be abrupt but the Italians or the the the low countries or Spain or Portugal these are countries that are marginal to what we say what we mean when we talk about Europe and so they watch and I think we all deserve to have a little bit of I don't know sympathy because where the the Europeans are may be where the Americans will follow and here's what I mean they're watching the new world emerge the Europeans pick up a newspaper and they read about China and the United States that's all they read about that's where the economic struggles are that's where the new developments are that's where the struggle between them is and to all of that the Europeans are secondary marginal footnotes in the technology wars in the military nothing they they do what the Americans ask them in Ukraine they don't other than that they have nothing to to say and nothing much to do the disunity there was a killer they didn't get their act together they didn't become a big place you notice China is a big place and America is a big place if you're going to be powerful you're got to be a big place or else unify many little ones into something that can pretend it's a big place Europeans haven't done that and they are now paying a terrible terrible price and and I don't see an end at this point and they're going to get desperate and they're going to do strange things the the electorate in the Netherlands gave you an idea two weeks ago of some strange things the Italian elections a few months earlier gave you some strange things and more of them are coming not all right-wing not at all but you know there's an immense realignment going on and notice footnote to what Michael said in most European countries the social the Communist party has disappeared the Socialist Party has shrunk to a tiny Remnant look in France look in Italy um Portugal is a is my favorite exception the government in Portugal is a coalition of the Portuguese Socialist Party the Portuguese Communist party and the Portuguese green party which is of course another Direction and the Portuguese are very proud of being different but they're very proud of being different in a scenario of Europe that is as dire as anything I could have imagined at this point for that part of the world my mother was born in Germany my father was born in France you know I carry that European tradition even though I was born here in United States you know it's where my folks came from and so very present in my mind I don't think there's any way of seeing uh where Europe will go and as Richard said there's something emotional when I've talked to many European politicians and they're literally emotional about the fear of Russia especially in e Germany they were so traumatized by the stalinist uh what the stalinist did there same thing in lvia uh same thing in the baltics uh it's it's almost a traumatized population and in England too they believe they have to depend on America even though it's America that set out to break up uh the English uh Power and now the closing days of World War II uh they they still believe that they need America it's it's a dependency it's an emotional dependency and how on Earth can no matter what Richard and I can say economically or logically uh we're dealing with a traumatized patient yeah let let me you know I speak French and German fluid I go there often I read the newspapers almost every day etc etc it's very important what Michael just said you know I think Americans can understand it there's a lot of Americans who will if you talk to them uh about history tell you about the great danger to the United States uh represented by the Soviet Union there's a sizable portion of the American population that is not aware today from recent poing that the Soviet Union is not a socialist economy and hasn't been since 1989 okay they're not aware and these are not stupid people these are not people who never read a news they just why Russia is is awful Russia is terrible Russia always was terrible what psychology the field of psychology has a wonderful concept it's called the concept of displacement you have many problems in your Society all of us do we have many problems in our personal lives you know with our spouse with our children with our parents with our neighbor with our boss with our all the people we interact with but under some conditions human beings will displace a whole network of problems onto one that one will then hold for them all their hostility all their antipathy all their fear we know it for example here in our country when people are asked why are you a white supremacist and out of their mouth will come a Litany of painful experiences in their lives and you will try to say to them that one you just mentioned that's got nothing to do with white or black people and that one has nothing to do what what are you but not for them they have displaced onto this issue why because they couldn't do anything about a bad boss they couldn't do anything about a government that was screwing them they couldn't do any but they can they're allowed in their environment to dump on black people or brown people or for that matter any other kind of people because this game has been played on people who have you know a left-handed as opposed to right-handed people who pray to this God rather than that one it's etc etc ET this displacement in Europe goes far back Napolean invaded Russia and was defeated Hitler invaded Russia and was defeated the Europeans have this complicated relationship to a backward Corner that was awful and Powerful at Key moments and how to solve all that and then comes the Soviet Revolution and now you're allowed to hate them because they're evil Communists and there's too much here too much has built up to to teach an entire continent to displ not everybody of course but to displace large parts of what they deem to be dangers in life onto this one you know when I tell people that the GDP of of Russia Today is1 and a half trillion dollars and the GDP of the United States is $23 trillion and that this is a conflict between an elephant and a fly they look at me they look at me like the little puppy who has been denied you know a bone they've been denied they've been denied what by what by the statistic the imagination that the that this Terror that they're afraid of isn't there it's like trying to tell the two-year-old let's go to the closet and turn on the light and you will see there are no monsters in that closet they won't go with you they have developed in their little two years of life a notion of monsters in the closet that you are not going to talk them out of because it's what the French call an e you know it is it has become a support for them and the Europeans look the Germans know as Michael said they lost the cheap energy they know what it means they saw that when there was a chance that they might be able to finagle away to keep holding on to it that the United States or somebody like them blew up that pipeline so they weren't going to get it they you know it was for them and in German newspapers to this day there's speculation that the Russians blew up the pipeline they had just spent billions of dollar building you know that's desperate that's desperate and I think yeah yeah go ahead in United States it's not a trauma uh yesterday Senator Murphy of uh New Jersey uh said uh was appalled at the fact that uh the Republicans were not going to vote for War uh against Russia in Ukraine and he said if you don't stop the Russians in Ukraine they're going to March right in into Western Europe now you can't say that the American senators are traumatized but they're part of the whole thing trying to uh trying to whoop up the Americans into this uh nonsense is if Russia has any interest in marching into Europe and if you read uh uh president uh Putin's speeches and SEC labov's speeches what you get from uh the Russians is a feeling of just disgust with how can the Europeans be committing not seeing that we were offering them such a uh economic uh Prosperity uh and there's also a feeling of disgust with of themselves of saying how could we have been so naive to believe that the Europeans were reasonable there's just the feeling in Russia uh the the opposite of the traumatized Europe is saying ah with time to turn East uh we it was a how could we have ever hoped uh to be reasonable with Europe we uh they're uh look at what they're doing we're giving up and they're they the last thing they want is to have to spend money on occupying Europe which uh already cost a lot of money for the old Soviet Union they're never going to go into that again for the Russians what they remember of the occupation of Europe is uh Russia was helping the central Europeans live better than the Russians it was doing everything it could to hold them that that's that's their trauma that and the trauma of course was what when they tried to take European and American advice in the 1990s and as President Putin said Russia lost more of its population through neoliberal policies than it lost in World War II uh so you're having matching uh it's like the opposite ends of the magnet yeah you know it it is a very tragic situation you know we all know or we should how much of the culture of the world was shaped by the last four or five six centuries of Europe I mean the modern technology modern philosophy modern fill-in the blank is overwhelmingly shaped by Europe not only but but Europe had an enormous influence on everything we think and and how we do everything and to watch that place stop being this Center of anything is an amazing historical process that we are living through it is it is it's just like the next gener as the next generation of Hightech gadgets shapes our lives and they all have Chinese writing on them that's going to shape the consciousness of Americans and Europeans and in a way that a lot of these other events won't but that daily Chinese right wrting on the phone you're staring at is going to make a difference and they're going to make sure you see that writing because they understand also what is going on here you know the the old adage beware if you live in in interesting times be very nervous about where that may take you we're living in very interesting times the world economy is changing has already changed let's keep in mind every every country in Asia Africa and Latin America that has as a priority that it doesn't want to be the poor country that it has been for a long time will recognize that its high priority of becoming not poor has been achieved by one of the poorest countries on Earth in China and when they think about what they should do and how they should should do it they're going to look over there and before they undertake any action at the very least they will play the G7 off of the bricks they have an option now they didn't have before and however the pace is they're going to be choosing the other and the the fact of that for the West should be terrifying in terms of where that lead that's just everybody's eating into Europe's lunch and America's lunch and and they're watching it and they can't do anything the frustration there is building and produces nonsense like the senator from New Jersey or our president who after losing a war in Ukraine for a year in three quarters has no better option than to shake his head admit that the the so-called counter offensive of this summer was a complete and total failure and nothing in the in the future promises to be different what I told you before about the relative GDP of the United States and Russia applies again to Russia versus Ukraine this is another elephant and a fly and you the elephant may be irritated the elephant May pay a price but it's not going to be defeated by the fly that's not going to happen and you're either going to have to face that at some point or admit that your strategy was the wrong one and we have leaders who can't do these things so it sits look how long it took to extract Americans from uh Afghanistan turn the whole country back over to the Taliban against whom the fight was supposed to be from the beginning I mean these are not just failures they are so abject that on the one hand you can understand the pretense that they didn't happen and yet on the other hand you have to understand that a society that can do that and fail at it and not discuss and deal with it whoa that's a society telling you it's going to do this again and again because it has no [Music] option
