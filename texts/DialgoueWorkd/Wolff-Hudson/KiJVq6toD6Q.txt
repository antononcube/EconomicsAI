Richard let's start with fed Zakaria report on CNN he's claiming that Global tides are turning against autocracy explaining this to us if that's the fact on the ground right now how did you find the presidential debate as well I want to know about that as well and let's get S there yeah I I found find fared Zachariah um a little bit like um President Biden uh mostly my reaction is sadness in the case of Biden that his age and his infirmities are catching up to him and in the case of fared that his desperate desire to find something to feel positive about uh our catching up with him uh I don't think either of them understands or if they do is willing to face or admit their problem and that is that their Politics the kind of political ideas that they have committed their whole lives to to are declining and this is very depressing I understand the depressing feeling of that if you've been on the left uh for most of the last 50 60 years you have been forced to face that kind of a sense of decline a sense of Doom and it is it is not enjoyable it is not uplifting it is depressing there's no there's no better word for it and I think Mr Biden and Mr Zachariah are depressed and they are looking for something uh hopefully to believe in um and maybe they'll find it I don't see it but maybe they'll find it I'm not looking for it they are so maybe they will uh but let me tell you what the signs are that they are not facing and I can start today with the uh election results last Sunday in France okay let's be sure we understand the importance the leader in France Emmanuel macron was a middle of the road enthusiastic Pro cap capitalist leader he had flirted a little bit with Center left politics he held a position in a socialist government some years ago he clearly flirted with a center right position most of his policies um since he won a strange election that made him president but whatever you think of him he was enthusiastic about pursuing the war in IR uh in Ukraine against Russia he was enthusiastic about supporting Israel in h Gaza and he was enthusiastic about protecting and strengthening the capitalist system in France and the French people responded to these commitments by throwing him out of office he received just over 20% of the vote last Sunday in France which means that four out of five French voters do not want him in office by far the most harsh commentary on centerof the road routine capitalism of the last 50 years Mr Trump represents a similar rejection of the old system in the United States Mr St armor a weak character still in all represents in the overwhelming defeat he is about to enjoy over the conservative party which is going to be voted out of office as totally as macron was in France uh later this week so you can see why fared Zachariah is depressed his notion of what the West represents is going down everywhere with very few exceptions okay number one now number two nothing is new about what fared Zachariah wants to say he basically is saying there that the mass of people are depressed and that he wants to give them some of his own optimism but he ought to begin by asking why are they depressed and the answer is overwhelmingly that their economic situation is bad if they live in a western European style social democracy they are seeing it reduced every year Services taken away taxes increased I mean for example the entire yellow vest movement in France which was the beginning of the end for Mr MCR anyway was a response to his trying to persuade the French public to improve their environmental situation by paying a tax on fuel and they said we favor ecological Improvement but not at our expense and he didn't get it he didn't understand what they were telling him fared Zachariah doesn't want people people to think about their economic reality he wants them to think about values he calls them values now that takes a lot of nerve what values is he talking about well he says autocracy versus democracy okay autocracy Russia he claims is autocratic but they now allow more diversity in Russia than Mr zalinski allows in the Ukraine Israel may be Democratic whatever that means inside Israel but it is extremely autocratic in Gaza and in the West Bank and here in the United States States what are we talking about every major part of our economy is governed by large corporations the majority of our people are either employees of those corporations or dependent upon those corporations in some other way how are those corporations organized answer autocratically the CEO of a corporation is not a Democrat the workers there don't elect this person they have no power over them the the CEO can fire them right 10% of our workers are represented by a union and have a contract that gives them some protection for their job and their income the other 90% of American workers depend on an autocratic economic system and that autocratic system is hurting them in recent years by inflation by job conditions by dep depriving them benefits of various kinds so for the mass of people of course they're not excited about the difference between autocracy and democracy because economically they live in an autocracy and politically the same autocrats by the political system and everybody knows it so what is Mr Zachariah talking about well you know it's very old long ago those who defend capitalism knew they had very little economic argument so they tried to make their argument about politics so the left is dictatorial it used to be said whereas capitalism is democratic okay maybe that worked for a while when the Socialist world was very poor and you could fool people into thinking that capitalism made you well off and socialism made you poor and there are those who still try that but it doesn't work because the most rapidly growing econ economic wealth is in China and China is a socialist economy so the argument doesn't work very well which is why it is not succeeding very well and that is why what Farid Zachariah is trying to do is to resuscitate to revive an old argument Working Class People please look at the for of government don't look at your daily job conditions don't look at the daily reality you face which is your political leaders are light ears from you and anything you can control it's not going to work it hasn't worked now for years which is why fared Zachariah is depressed but because he doesn't ask these questions he doesn't face these real ities he'll keep giving the same advice it reminds me of nothing so much as recent months when the spokespeople for the Biden Administration have told us over and over again the American economy is in good shape but the mass of the voters don't think the American economy is in good shape and so the question is what's the matter with them why are they ignorant why don't they see and my answer to them has been they're not ignorant and they see perfectly clearly but they don't see what you see or to be more accurate you don't see where they live you live in the world of the top 10% the ones who own 80% of the shares in the stock market the stock market is doing nicely the top 10% are doing nicely but the mass of the people are not doing nicely they aren't ignorant they aren't stupid they are in a different situation and you are losing their support that's what Mr Trump represents and that was the sad reality of watching Mr Biden the problem is not his age and the problem is not his government they are doing what democratic governments have always done he represents the pretense that all is well and that's what's defeating him and Mr Trump has the luxury of saying all is not well vote for me I'll make it better and the worst irony of all is that the reason Mr Biden won the election last time is that he said to Trump then what Trump is saying to Biden now this is a dead old politics and we're watching it painfully disintegrate good goodbye ma goodbye sunak goodbye and we will have many more in the months and years ahead have send you an article in Bloomberg it says that us company becomes world's most valuable solar firm after Chinese rival slip we know that China produces most of these solar panels in the world but how the US a US company can get to that level in your opinion very easy and again there is a sadness to the Bloomberg story a United States company comes to number one you know for the last I don't know at least 10 years that same company has not been number one uh and it's very easy to explain what is going on and Bloomberg knows what I'm about to explain to you but for the moment the statistic is correct and they want to grab the moment this pathetic game so let's begin China has devoted itself logically being the new upand coming economic power to trying to to identify where they have the best chance to outmaneuver the United States and by the way they don't do that just to be number one in in the rankings of Bloomberg they do that in the same way that for example after World War II the rebuilding of the German Japanese and other economies had to face the fact that the dominant economy in the world after World War II was the United States no bomb fell here after Pearl Harbor and the big problem of unemployment of the 1930s was overcome by World War II which put all Americans back to work so America had a thriving capitalist economy in 1945 quickly Domin the world and the only way capitalists in Germany defeated Japan defeated Britain and France not defeated the only way they could come back was to look at the dominant player us corporations and figure out somehow using their Laboratories their scientists their managers how to produce new or different or better or cheaper than the United States that was the goal and the Chinese starting later they didn't really get going until the 1980s more or less had the same issue they had to do better than the United States or the Germans Japanese British and French and so on because they had but the same problem and so they went to work one of the areas they focused on was renewable energy for the obvious reason that you would run out of oil eventually and gas so renewable energy everybody understood was important and the Chinese because of the way their economy is organized they can concentrate Focus private and public together to solve problems which is something private Enterprise economies like Britain and America have much harder time doing so the Chinese chose among other things electric vehicles and solar panels other things too but I'm going to pick those two because they become very important and within a few years the Chinese figure out the best solar panels at the lowest price and the best electric vehicles at the lowest price okay they then begin to sell it all over the world and they dominate the markets in these Commodities among others and they're doing more and more of that every day they are very successful in this strategy one of the ways that Chinese succeed is they give subsidies and supports to any business that goes into the areas that they prioritize such as solar panels and electric vehicles so for example they give lots of support and they have lots I believe 60 or 70 solar panel companies because they don't know which one will figure out the best way to make up and all of that they know because they have done this now many times they know that 60 or 70 will sooner or later outproduce the market there'll be two too many and those that are the the least effective will go out of business that repeats what happens in every industry many producers become few producers in China that's the process going on now there it's been going on for a few years there is a process of over supply of solar panels and many less efficient firms Falling Away going out of business that's a normal part of the development of private Enterprise in China and everywhere else the number one com uh uh company uh lingo it's a name like that I don't it's I don't pronounce the Chinese but it's like that the number one company in China has had particular troubles it's not the most efficient and it has been over the last two years cutting employment and cutting production if you look at it it went from being many times larger to the United States First Solar the number one company in this country from many times larger to being about the same size now so the arrival of the American company to number one is not an achievement of the American company it is the collapse of the number one Chinese company coming all the way down to where the American company is it was much bigger than the American company for most of the last few years the Bloomberg table doesn't show you any of that who will replace the Chinese company that has come down others of the Chinese competitors who are in better shape will now get larger replacing the position of the one that fell apart right if you understand anything about capitalist industry this is the way this is normally done but I'm not finished let's now look at the number one American company First Solar right it has Chinese companies that again much larger and have come down to its size and there are other Chinese companies roughly the same size so it's a it's ahead it's a number one but bu this a am and now the thing that should be in the Forefront one of the reasons First Solar is even even in a position to do anything is because it got huge subsidies from the Biden Administration in fact there are investigations going on right now because huge millions of dollars of donations by investors in First Solar went to to Biden already back in 2020 and the Biden Administration when it passed the um the uh what was it fight back to inflation Bill one of its big bills contained subsidies for solar panels which went in the main to the First Solar Corporation in other words what you're watching is the subsidization of capitalist solar production in China and the ketchup subsidization of solar panel Productions in the United States this is not a victory for the United States this is not nothing that might be suggested by that Bloomberg table is honest it's very sad it's childish the Chinese are beating us in all of these Technologies including solar panels they have much bigger production than we do and as I've just given you the particular history of those companies the biggest one in China and the biggest one here you will begin to understand that the situation cannot be read as some sort of arrival of the UN United States uh at a position of dominance it has no such dominance it never had that dominance in solar panels and I could of course tell you pretty much the same about electric vehicles but I won't because it repeats the same story Americans like Bloomberg are desperate you have to be desperate to make a table like that and then have a headline and hope that your readers feel better because an American company is number one and you don't tell them the story which by the way in other available sources everybody can learn I'm not relying on anything that is special the information I gave you about the Chinese company and about the First Solar here the US company is in information I got from sources like Bloomberg among others they have them I have them but what you're seeing is an example of the denial that Americans are engaged in because they do not want to face the decline of their system and their empire Richard we in this election in France we have two po is above macron's party the first party is a rightwing party the second is a leftwing party and how do you see that these two parties coming above the macron party could you expand on what's going on right now in Europe yes let me Focus first on France because too many people know too little about what's going on there okay first of all on the right the right-wing party the rally the national rally the national uh grouping under Leen Marina Leen uh it got about 34% of the vote so about a third on the left there was a coming together of four political parties who have not not been very unified until recently and have had many struggles amongst each other but it's important for people to understand who the four parties were so number one and the leader is called France unbowed France andum which literally means France not subordinated unsubordinated you know Anum is what it means uh and their leader Jean Luke melon uh the this is a Socialist Party very openly and very affirmatively enthusiastically and they are the largest party then comes the French Communist party which has been the same communist part party for many many decades number three the French Socialist Party once very large now small and number four the french green party those four parties came together and formed the new popular front which is a reference to a similar unification of the left uh back in the 1930s which was also called itself the popular front it is very important that these left-wing parties could get together and overcome their differences it is very important that the efforts of the macron government public and also under the table by police and intelligence internal to disrupt and keep them fighting each other that failed they came together okay they got 28% of the vote not much less than the rightwing and Mr mcon the sitting president got about 20% of the vote in other words four out of five French voters want Mr maon gone that is an amazing statement for a Centrist president of one of the four major economies in Europe Britain France Spain and Italy the four big ones he was enthusiastically for the war in Ukraine against Russia he's gone he was a big supporter of Israel he's gone the people of France look what they have told you and then they're almost split between whether to go left or whether to go right the only thing they really all agree on is get rid of Mr mcon if we had in the United States against Trump on the right Bernie Sanders or someone like him on the left Mr Biden would be looking at us the way Mr Marron is looking at the French people as he says goodbye I'm gone I am finished that's very important to understand for the left everywhere here's what's important to understand don't be disunified it makes you weak and ineffective understand that if you get all of the potential left Wingers together you can win political power okay 6% of the French voters is all that if 3% leave the right and go to the left we have a different outcome and in the second next week next Sunday when the the vote the second vote in France happens the question will be what will the 20% who voted for mron what will they do confronted with what they're going to see okay the next thing that has to be understood and I know this is difficult but you know you asked the right questions so I'm going to give you what I think is the right answer none of the three not maon not Le Pen and even not milono have a solution they haven't put one forward Mr mcon lost this election because he's the man in charge and he is obviously unable to do anything to change the basic problems French people face that's why they voted against him now what is the rightwing propose very strange they want to get rid of immigrants but immigrants are not France's problem whether you keep them or send them home or keep some of them or they you're not changing the basic problems of the French economy this is silly your misunderstanding that's a useful scapegoat that enabled the rightwing to get voters because they at least saying something the situation is terrible so we are going to put the burden of a bad situation on those poor immigrants from Africa North Africa South afca the ones that come to France and for the French people and I don't admire this but for the French people okay so that's less burden on us more burden on them will support that it helps us a little but even the French people kind of know this is and what else are you going to do okay you're GNA maybe stop the war in in Ukraine or at least pull the French out of it but he's not going to change the basic conditions of France either and they know that and the same is true about whatever happens in Gaza they know they so what what and the answer is nothing there's nothing there there's a clever phrase in the United States now that I can use when you're looking for something you're hungry for something and instead you get what is called a nothing Burger two pieces of bread and in between nothing it's a disappointment so the if you elect Leen you will have a government that will disappoint the French people after whatever Euphoria after they do something really ugly to poor immigrants they will not solve the problem now let's turn to Mr melon he doesn't have a solution either what are you going to do raise taxes somewhat on the corporations sure raise wages good improve the pensions of French workers nice that's not going to solve the problems of French capitalism you know the reaction of French businesses will be leave if they can to cut back to wage an economic version of Guerilla war against these liberal left Wingers we know that that's what they do so what is the left going to do they're going to make the conditions worse people are going to sell stocks on the F shares on the French stock market and buy instead in the New York Stock Market what's the plan what are you what are you going to do what is your program that could solve the problem of the French economy that has accumulated over the last 75 years of postor War II capitalism they're afraid some of them because I know some of them they have some plans but they're afraid if they say them if they try to implement them there will be such a reaction that they will be defeated and my answer to them is if you don't do it I assure you you will be defeated because you know what'll happen you'll get a rightwing replacing maon it will fail then there will be turned to the leftwing bring them in but then when they fail you know what Mr mcon or another zero like him will reemerge and I will F and people will turn to him not because they believe believe it but because they know that the rightwing and the left wing have just failed just like they knew this Sunday that macron was a failure and they are trying something else therefore for me here's the message Western capitalism this private Enterprise dominated system of factories offices and stores in which a tiny group of wealthy powerful people make all the basic decisions we all know how it works because we all live and work in that system that's the problem you've got to come up with an alternative and a plan to achieve it or else you will not solve the problems of this system that's what this is election should teach you and my hope is that the leftwing will get the idea [Music] Unity organization and ideology for Unity but also Unity around a real program you will eventually be the left will be the political power to which the voters will eventually turn they will turn away from a mron and they will try a rightwing for sure but when that is as failed as a look after four years of trump America voted for Biden you know after four years of Biden they look like they're going to vote for Trump this is crazy you know Biden is too old at 82 but Mr Trump at 78 is it's childish scapegoating the age scapegoating The Immigrant these are all desperate efforts not to face the structural problem that capitalism particularly the private F version we have in the West can no longer do what it did it is not winning the competition it's losing it China is showing us that the hybrid this mixture of half a go government-owned and operated Enterprises half private Enterprises both of them managed and controlled by a development focused Communist party it's a better system it can grow better and you either deal with that or you pretend it's not happening or like fared Zachariah you somehow tell yourself we are democratic and they are authoritarian and that's what everybody should please pay attention to even though it doesn't work and it isn't true and it misses the whole basic issue for the mass of people and I don't think therefore I say this as a fellow podcaster with fared Zachariah I advise him to change his message because his audience is going to leave yeah you know that Modi in his first visit after his election he's going to be in Russia we know how the West is convincing India not to be so close to Russia or China how's that working in your opinion on the P of the western mindset well the way I would answer it is to tell you that when I was a graduate student getting my PhD in economics um I took a course in Economic Development it was called and one of the topics that our professor uh stressed was what he referred to and this is the 1960s was the competition between India and China to develop these were both huge countries both Asian countries both very poor countries and their overwhelming goal was to stop being poor and I remember the importance the professor gave to telling us that this would be an important lesson for the world because one country was Communist that was the language used then and the other one was Democratic that was what they language they used um I remember trying to explain to my professor that what China had was a Communist party but that China did not think of itself as a Communist economy just like the Soviet Union never did that this was a western choice of language which was very confusing to people because it didn't understand that they thought they were socialists but I got the idea and I said to him equally India Democratic I mean the majority of people in India have one overwhelming worry will they be alive tomorrow you know did this the poverty there is is is it's bad in China but is even worse in in India well we've had the experiment now for half a century and China is here and India is here I don't want to take away from what India has accomplished it has developed but it has left the majority of its people out of that development they are as poor almost now as they were 50 years ago and that is not the case in China or at the very least a much larger percentage I mean China is now what it is it is the great power um confronting the United States India is an important country but it's not China that competition is over may start up again but it's over that's the first thing I would say number two notice communist versus Democratic in 1960 and here we are 70 years later and fared Zachariah is giving us authoritarian and Democratic this is the same old story is not going to work it didn't work all that well then and it sure as hell is not going to work uh now and Mr Modi is clearly and even in number of commentaries in the west considered authoritarian even though the Americans still hope that because the ruling party in India is not the Indian Communist party or I should say one of the several Indian communist parties it isn't those parties remain significant but small uh in China the Communist party has remained in power and so that alone given America's ideological they have hopes for India that they have given up for China so my guess is they are now focusing as best they can on trying to come up with some plan to separate India from China and from Russia and so far it looks like a big failure like so many of their policies uh India helped Russia out of the sanctions problem from the West that was an enormous service Russia has for a very long time been very supportive of India in many ways providing money providing weapons all kinds of stuff even when India used the weapons against Russia Ally China on their border and so forth there are tensions among them uh but I you know I don't think you know it's not fair to call Mr Lula in Brazil an authoritarian there's really I mean Americans do these things because they need these disagreement they they need to make the United States and the G7 good and uh bricks bad so they lump them all together but the truth is is and it's always been this way that for every authoritarian regime in one I'll find you one uh here most Latin American governments are very authoritarian whoever they are and even when the left wins it tends to replicate much of that and you have that in Venezuela and you had that a little bit in Cuba and so on and so I I find the whole thing really pretty much beside the point uh the ease with which uh Bin Salman the head of Saudi Arabia can be in the West on one day and in the bricks on the next day suggests to you that the issue is not how authoritarian the government is or isn't that is public relations for naive people to consume but for the rest of the world no they pretty much understand by the way Vietnam and Thailand have also now indicated their interest in joining the bricks look the bricks is now even before Malaysia or turkey just take the existing 11 countries that make up the bricks that is the biggest richest conglomerate in the world economy it is now significantly richer than the G7 the United States it means that every country on Earth has to rethink where are you making alliances where are you borrowing money who are you inviting to invest in your country where are you looking to Source inputs Imports where are you looking to sell you better understand if you sell I give you an example if you sell bananas and you're not in bricks but there's another country that sells bananas that is in bricks who's going to whose bananas are going to be purchased by the bricks you don't want to be left out you can't you have to come to some relationship even if you want to hold on to your links to the West with this otherwise you are going to be destroyed so what the countries are doing is beginning to figure out how to play the G7 against the bricks and vice versa if you're not in either of them and if you can't do that you better join and then who do you join you join the bigger the bricks are beginning to accumulate all of the advantages that the United States used to have nobody should be surprised least of all the United States what did you expect that you would always be the dominant there's never been an all every Empire that Rose fell every hamon that Rose fell you really think you're the exception stop it's childish it's not a it's not a reasonable uh object and you're watching the shift everybody is shifting their positions and the authoritarian versus Democratic that's an interesting question but that's being fought out inside every country just like it's being fought out in some way inside every Enterprise the reason you see a growing interest around the world in Cooperative Enterprises in worker Co Ops and other kinds of Co it's precisely that masses of people they don't want the authoritarian political but they don't want it in their workplace either and so can they will they might they yes how at what rate who knows but that's everywhere that's the immediate reality that is explaining the decline of the way and they're not going to save themselves by pretending a democracy they don't have and distinguishing it from the autocracy which is beside the point because what China offers the world is not a political model but an economic model That's The Power of what attracts people to China they want that economic growth they want that Global Prestige and recog nition of course they do that's what the United States wanted when it be stopped being a colony of Great Britain and wanted to develop it so you the ability to forget when it's convenient is not an admirable quality Richard just to wrap up this session beside that built and Road initiative that we talked about it before we have a project Pro among Iran Russia and India North sou transportation coridor that comes from Russia to aeran Iran then India it's huge it's huge when you look at the details it just reduces 40 to 60% the price of Transportation that's why I think that they cannot separate India from Russia because they have a lot in common right now Europe is the Biggest Loser of this conflict right now but it doesn't seem that they understand it no well first let me comment on that uh Transportation Corridor it reminds me of nothing so much as the building of railroads in the United States this country went from very poor very backwards small distant colony of written into a Powerhouse and nothing was more there were many factors but nothing was more important than building a rail system from the coast into the interior making it possible to link the two oceans making it possible to cheapen the time and the cost of Transportation it meant you could open up the V P middle to produce food for the world which it still does you know wheat and corn and and all the rest of it and that's what's happened and it created the United States it made it one country it made it possible for people to move to live in all those places that before had been left to the indigenous people who were of course eliminated what you see now should strike Americans as the logic the Russians the Iranians Indians they are doing exactly what they should be doing heavily investing in the means by which to link their economies to give themselves opportunities to trade that are much more attractive cheaper faster I mean it's a it opens up economic possibilities and yeah the Europeans are the ones that are going to be losing in the competition that this opens but that's their own fault it's the fault of the Europeans in two ways number one they could not overcome their divisions their different languages their different histories they're different and become unified enough right the irony is the Polish people the Irish people the Italian people the Hungarian people left those countries went to the United States and overcame all those differences but back home they didn't do it and the second failure is they could have been participants and partners just as the Chinese are participating with the Bel and Road and with that Corridor so you want to be part of this if you don't want it to be used against you then you have to make a contribution you have to make a commitment you have to connect your rail system to this one your transportation options and ports you have to integrate they didn't do it they fighting a dead old Cold War revived now so they've made Russia instead of a partner an enemy you know Putin years ago said we'll be your partner you know let's open up Russia biggest country on Earth by geography we need development you Europeans can help us instead they pushed NATO up against the Russians making them fearful rightly and enemies understandably and so now they're going to be left out you're right and we're going to have a growing competition led by a heavily invested East Russia and East and the United States or what's left of it and and you know the Europeans are going to be at best second AR Junior partners of the United States and that they will be the first sacrificed in any difficulties between the United States and the Chinese and Russian Indian Colossus and I understand why Mr Modi whatever his political objectives he's looking at the same situation and he understands where he's going to go and the British are are thereby reaping 400 years of colonial dominance of India during which they left enough of a bad taste to support all of this and you know there's a certain historic justice to all of this that plays its role also and I and I I I find it astonishing that Americans are as blind blinded by their ideology that they don't see I'm reminded I think I spoke with you about it once before I'm reminded of the discovery in the United States that after two and a half years of war Russia in Ukraine their economy is in better shape than it was before the war started the United States that experienced exactly that in World War II it took a depressed economy and put it back to work in the war discovering explosive growth they couldn't imagine that happening in Russia even though it had happened in the United States that's a that's when your ideology is blinding you you you you can't see straight you can't think correct you make strategic mistakes of a historic nature and you will not learn even though I am not the only one to try to teach this lesson I know that policy makers in the United States watch your program you know how I know because they send me emails I know them I went to the same schools they did so I know they know but they cannot break out out of it it's like watching a person so wrapped up in a way of thinking that even as it hurts them they can't escape there's something terribly sad about that and that's why I open my comments with you today by saying it's very sad watching Bloomberg put up that table they when number one is so sad you know you you have to resort to this you know playing around my God my my statistics teacher loved to open his classes by teaching us that statistics never lie but statisticians do good thank you Richard for being with us a great pleasure as always okay same here and I look forward to next time
