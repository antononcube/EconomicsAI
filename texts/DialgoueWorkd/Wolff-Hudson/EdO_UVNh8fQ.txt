hi everybody today is Thursday January 16th and our friend Michael Hudson and Richard Wolff are back with us after two weeks we didn't have Richard Wolff and he's back with us welcome back thank you very much I missed being on the show because it has become a regular part of my work so let's get started with what's going on in the Middle East a ceasefire after more than a year here is what Hearts supported in Israel that Trump forced Neto to accept the deal and when it comes to the importance of this new attitude on the part of the administration in the United States we don't know yet who is mostly responsible for this peace stocks but many people as hor pointed out are saying that Donald Trump is behind this and many people may remember those days in 1981 with Carter and Reagan with the hostages in Iran and Reagan came to power on January 20th the hostages the hostages were released by the Iranian government in those days what's the importance of this these days that we're living Richard in terms of what's going on in Gaza well I mean there are many ways to read the this I think haret is is right I think that will be the Judgment of History you can't possibly imagine that the arrival of a new president is just coincidentally connected with uh this uh decision to have a ceasefire so it clearly is not something that Biden did because he couldn't do it for for the all the the whole history of the war is a history of miscalculation they weren't ready to prevent it they weren't ready to deal with it they weren't ready to work out an accommodation they blocked it from the earliest meetings in February of of 2022 uh when the war had just begun and they were meeting we all know about these meetings now because of what was said we know about the whole buildup toward the War uh Angela Merkel made it crystal clear and others have corroborated it so the bottom line is that Mr Trump was prepared through his uh Emissary Mr witkoff they he was prepared to to say what everybody knew Mr Biden could have said at any point or to make it more accurate Mr Biden said all kinds of things but he didn't do anything the bottom line is Israel could not have such a war without the money and the weapons provided by the United States if at any time a serious threat to the Israelis including Mr Netanyahu a serious threat to withdraw the money and or the weapon and you would have gotten this decision and therefore and the history history will make this judgment whether we do or not the complicity of the United States in what Israel did in Gaza is hereby established I mean most of us understood it already but here it's Crystal Clear whatever the words were Israel understood that the new president would not hesitate to do what the old president repeatedly hesitated to do and that made all the difference as most of us understood in the larger historical frame let me go further Israel as a society made the decision through many years and many different governments to Hitch its wagon to make its bed with the United States to become dependent upon the United States in virtually every major way militarily for sure financially for sure and politically right down to the most recent United Nations votes which had weird numbers like 120 PE countries on one side a dozen in the middle and the United States and Israel virtually alone I mean you have achieved over time not just a close Alliance but you achieved utter isolation and that's not going to go away because the the kind of warfare undertaken in Gaza makes all of that worse makes it last longer makes it run deeper and you're going to see I'm sure over the months and years ahead since this ceasefire is just that it's not a solution to the war it is a an agreement not to continue fighting for a while you're going to see very active uh efforts on the part of all of the Middle East all the Arab countries allied with all the Islamic countries allied with all their supporters inside the bricks and outside as well and that's going to keep up the isolation keep up the difficulty Israel has hooked its future as it has hooked its past on the United States but here's the key problem the United States as Michael and I have been discussing with you Neema for months now the United States Empire is declining shrinking dying if you like and American capitalism has got an accumulation of problems not the least of those problems it are so severe that the only reaction the country has is to deny it so we just had a presidential election in which neither Mr Trump nor Biden nor kamla Harris said a word about a declining Empire said a word about an accumulation of economic problems that really are historic longlasting long building instead they engaged in what passes for politics in this country is the theater of blaming each other as if one or the other party were the problem instead of one and the other problem other party being the problem so so I think what we have reached is a historical shift the United States in trying to cope with the problems it denies it has is prepared to throw Israel under the bus it was something that could have and should have been understood from the beginning there were other paths for Israel to follow it could have related to its own Arab Community let's all remember Israel roughly speaking is a country of 7 Mill ion Arabs and 7 million Jews uh and and there's a complicated way of trying to work such a society it has been accomplished in other countries it does not have to mean endless warfare that's a silly idea there are alternatives they didn't pursue them or at least the dominant forces in Israel to Israel's credit they have always had an opposition they have one now har is part of that opposition that you have just shown us that clip but the dominant politics of that country made them have an alliance which they have never really questioned and which is now confronting them with what it means to be the very Junior partner to an alliance with a an an enormously powerful country that is losing the power that made you Ally with them in the first place this this reality is going to have to be faced no matter how long it's covered over with political noise of the sort we're going to be seeing a lot of in the weeks ahead well Richard has said pretty much anything that I could have said about that uh I guess there are a couple of questions why do has Israel depended so much on the United States uh it's not only because uh the United States zionists uh have uh given hundreds of millions of dollars of support uh to the Dion uh Zionist charge uh but it's also because uh Israel is allowed to bribe politicians Congress uh lawmakers in the United States in a way that it can't do in any other country uh because of citizens united citizen United says has privatized the political process here and said it's okay to uh have your policies decided by your donors and uh all Israel has to do is ask for congress for money send part of the money back to the Congressional campaigns and uh it's a circular flow and uh that has essentially bought Congress uh but what you're saying Richard is well Trump is not Congress Trump uh uh is an entirely different uh situation he has got a hundred million from Sheldon adelson's wife uh to support Israel uh what what can Trump say he can say well of course I support Israel but I don't support Netanyahu uh and he's had a lot of problems with Netanyahu as have the Israeli citizens as a whole uh and so that's one uh issue it's all going to come down uh as Richard point out is after the uh inauguration at the beginning of next week is uh Trump going to continue to authorize the shipping of bombs and Military uh support uh to Israel and in fact will he have the power over the Army to really stop this well the problem is that next week is only the first day of his administration what he said he's going to do is uh end the independence of uh the CIA the National Security Agency and the FBI uh to to essentially uh disobey the orders that the executive branch gives to it how long will it take him to uh actually enforce that and is there any enforceability and everything that we're talking about uh in Israel and the Ukraine comes down to enforce ability uh Agreements are easy to make uh Israel has uh Netanyahu has already said we'll sign any agreement you want but we're not going to follow it we're going to do whatever I want and what I want is H what the Israeli people want we want to kill everyone in Israel who is not Jewish we want to kill uh this is a race war It's A civilizational War uh we consider the gazans as we've said to be subhumans and God told us to kill him our agreement we we have a covenant with God that's our agreement and no agreement that we make uh uh with Arab countries who uh we do not respect or with the United States is stronger than our covenant with go God to uh to murder uh all the non- Israelis here so we can have a truly religious uh God-fearing State that's the mentality uh that we're dealing with uh and in a way you could say this has a parallel with uh what Trump has promised to do at the beginning of his administration with uh Ukraine how can Ukraine feels exactly the same way it doesn't matter uh what kind of agreement they've made they've made agreements in the past uh uh uh with Russia they they have their constitutional uh statement of how uh Ukraine is supposed to be we're back down to the Enforcement issue and we're in a era now where uh there's really no such thing as enforcable international law and that uh means that almost all the agreements that we're talking about uh are meant to sound good uh without any intention of following through uh the kind of agreements that the newspapers were talking about uh yesterday about Israel stopping bombing Gaza is exactly what happened uh just before President Obama uh took office they all made the same promise he took office then immediately they began bombing Gaza again so uh I'm not optimistic that the bombing is going to stop uh I think that the Israeli parties are um already have said they're not supporting Netanyahu if he does uh uh live up to the agreement the United States and does not kill uh their uh it does not kill all the Palestinians that's the mentality we're dealing with and I don't know how there can be a uh solution under that kind of a situation well it would be very D I mean I understand everything you're saying but it would be very dangerous at this point for all of the players including Mr Trump if nothing happens it will make him look like what you just said it will make expose him to being a theatrical prop who goes through the same agreement Camp David uh or all of that with no outcome with W with purely distractive window dressing uh to avoid dealing with a problem and for a new president who wants to establish and whose whole political career is I am different from the convention the bush the Clinton the Obama I'm not them look at how I talk look at who I gather around me look at who I choose to be in my cabinet I'm not them I'm I'm the Common Man I'm The you know this is not new in history this play acting at a populism uh you know the Republicans present themselves as something fundamentally different from Democrats they've tried that for years they're running out of gas with that as are the Democrats and so you need a refresher Mr Trump is a refresher he's really different you see from the others he isn't of course any more than they were different from one another in being cheerleaders for capitalism which is what they each compete with the other to be and he isn't any different from that however he understands that their game I'm different from one another is the game to play and for him therefore he's different from both of them he rejects the conventional Republicans he rejects the Democrats almost with equal fervor with equal intensity and he sets himself up as a de facto third party trying to hold on to the same political regime that the two parties always did except I'm new and I'm Different which is what each of the presidential candidates tried to say and most Americans could care less I would like to pick up on that last point if I could Neema I think another part of what's going on in addition to everything we've said is the desire of Mr Trump understandably to deal with a problem which is that he has no mandate the election was much too close for there to be any serious talk of mandate he handles that partly by insisting that he has a mandate that that's the way politics works if you can't get the reality well then use the BS and cover it over with endless repetition I understand that so he has to talk about the mandate he doesn't have but he knows he doesn't have it so he has to do some theatrical things that will give him more of a support than he actually has and being able to say I brought peace to the Middle East is a is a feather in his cap it's a useful thing for him to be able to do in the days of just before and I'm sure the days just after the inauguration and it will allow him to say to large groups of the American people what they already know which is he accomplished what Biden year after year said he was in favor of but could never quite get done uh Mr Biden has paved the way for Mr Trump who barely even has to say it I did it Biden talked about it but I did it he can't back away from that very quickly and it does something to give him a bit more broad support for all the other things because there's going to be opposition if he tries to deportation to Mexico if he tries the Tariff regime he's going to suffer enormous internal opposition and he needs to look like a global Peacemaker I believe that's behind all the noise about Greenland and Panama and all that other nonsense because that he can get the unity of the American people they don't care you know what happens to Greenland one way or another and it has a certain romantic notion we're taking over everywhere that allows you to have the illusion that your Empire isn't shrinking on the contrary you're building it these are gestures that come right out of his dilemas and I think that's part of what's going on here well I hope you're right uh Richard uh you use the word theatrical prop and I guess you could say that all us diplomacy is a theatrical plot uh it's and what's the plot it's all about the narrative uh and again without uh enforcement uh Powers what how are you going to get beyond the uh uh the theatrical uh that's again that's the problem not only for uh M uh president Trump being a peac maker in the near East but also in uh Ukraine I think you're right about this Bluster about Panama and about Greenland I think he's trying to uh show that's the theatrical part that he's trying to show Americans you see I'm really pro-american I'm for American power therefore let me do what I'm doing in Ukraine which uh the American firsters uh the anti- Russians are not going to like and uh what I uh May uh be able to do in Israel uh which also the zionists meaning the Democratic party and their donor class uh are not going to like so basically that's uh uh that's the problem how are you go what are you going to do uh about the enforcement uh for all of this and the enforcement is not only uh by the United States on Israel the enforcement is the executive branch Trump over what the state department does what the military does uh what will he do if the military state department and CIA go about their own uh their own policy uh he he's in a way trying to make foreign policy here I hope in the way that you say without consolidating his domestic power over the domestic agencies that did everything they could to uh prevent his election four years ago uh by uh the Trump derangement syndrome and uh the the FBI the whole uh support of the democratic party the the refusal to look at President Biden uh acting as a paid agent of the Ukrainian government negotiated by his son uh and Dem and documented on his son's computer uh that he got paid to do to commit America to the uh to the war in Ukraine uh how is uh I I think if Trump cannot do what uh you hope that he can do at that point you're going to have uh I would hope uh Trump do everything he could to really clean out what he's promised to do the CIA National Security Agency military and the FBI that's going to be I think domestically his an even bigger fight than what he's doing in the near East no I I agree I think that everything I said depends and you're right on his being able to pursue this kind of policy my reading and I I could very well be wrong about this of course but my reading is that the act around Israel was already the path of least resistance for him to take that he's not going to lose the support of his major donors in any significant way because of what he did this is it will make some of his pro-israeli donors unhappy and they may become more open now to becoming enemies of his that's true but I don't think that's a big enough uh group it's not a big enough phenomena to seriously threaten him and which is why he took it I think the contrast between that and either a mass deportation to Mexico or a mass tariff imposition on Mexico I think that will have much more profound opposition and consequences that will turn major parts of the donor capitalist class in the United States against him and that will provide allies to the bureaucrats who looking for for donors to be allies in a push back because remember the bureaucrat can look to the donors for allies and vice versa and they will find each other and they will become what makes it impossible for Mr Trump to do anything as they have done to Republican and Democratic presidents in the in the past this is not new this is what American real politics is they will all make the same bloviating statements Trump a bit more more aggressively than the others CU he has that task of being the new and the different and the all that whereas the rest of them play G watching for example as the Democrats explain to us why the choices for cabinet positions are unqualified that's really funny given the people that the Democrats have put into those positions with what qualification other than political loyalty financial support and so I mean it's this is really a theatric which has run out of gas but he's doing the same thing he has no new plan what he is playing basically the same game as they are but with a with a kind of a new face and a new facade and and so you know it's like a little bit like losing Mr Biden and substituting kamla Harris okay you lose Harris and the other and you get Trump but it's musical chairs among these people not not a serious problem but the more serious ones and though that's why we haven't heard all that much about it we have a few scary statements by the so-called deportation Zar but we don't know what's really going to happen there yet the push back I'm sure is building already you see it in the statements of the the lady who's now the leader in uh in Mexico Shin Bal she she's made it quite clear but she's also scared because she doesn't know like we don't how far this is going to go how much is going to be tried and at what point will the consequences which are extremely dangerous in my view for Mexico and thereby for the United States no one quite knows yet how far that's going to go before the push back becomes strong enough to stop it Mexico depends on remittances from the United States Mex the workers here it depends for its jobs on exports if you have a massive deportation you give to Mexico the following three point blows reduction serious in remittances reduction seriously in jobs as your exports are constrained and by deportation a vast influx of millions of people replacing the money that isn't coming anymore the remittances there's no way that the Mexican Government can handle loss of remittances loss of jobs influx of people who need jobs I mean is a it is a tsunami and then you have to ask what rational mentality would put the open-ended risk of a such a tsunami with a country that has a Thousand Mile border with you whose disruptions are going to over you we may see the most ironic switch of all a level of migration into the United States far larger than we've had in recent years because literally the alternative for Mexicans is to quietly die in their own country and we don't want to face any of that we have no discussion and it is astonishing that that I have to make statements which I do about the absurdity of a massive deportation because the Republicans have made this a a mass issue and the Democrats have basically said me too and so there is no discussion let alone debate about what this inails you're going to see a popularized issue if it's actually pursued have unbelievable consequences that will only make people two or three years from now wonder how this hysteria was allowed to develop as far as it clear clearly has well the reason we haven't found any discussion of this issue Richard is precisely because of what you just said it's it's such a huge magnitude that has been so thoroughly ignored by everyone to think about it because it's too big to think about it's almost impossible to think about the uh Mass economic destruction and demographic uphe and the problems between the US and Mexico's balance of payments uh that it's easier just not to think about it you you've put your finger on the trauma yeah I think it extends to Europe too I don't think we're giving anyone the Europeans are are now in what must be for them the realization of a nightmare the European countries like Israel got into bed hitched their wagon became dependent on the United States as their military protector as their economic partner as their political guarantor and we now have a leader who has every interest in Breaking from all of that he's going to make a deal with Mr Putin they kind of see it coming and it'll be a deal to end the war in Ukraine or at least suspend it and the every major leader in Europe has hitched his or her wagon to being supportive in Ukraine the only exceptions and they're not much of one but the only exceptions are uh you know the the hungarians and the the Czechs a little bit and so on but the others are all doing this and that's why you're seeing you know Mr maon in France you know he's got no approval he's a political dead weight he has no future uh it's even more pathetic to watch Mr starmer in England running around trying to keep going a war in which he was always a junior partner and had no real influen Mr Schultz who's already on his way out because he made that mistake by the way I noticed that Mr Schulz in order to get any leverage for his election has to become anti- Trump I don't know if you caught him he's actually he's so desperate that he's he's trying to switch in Midstream I don't think it'll fool very many German voters it might but I don't think so too little too late he denounced Mr Trump for wanting to take over other territory you know that's very strange you know you're fighting Mr Putin for taking over territory what suddenly your great Ally is talking about more territory involving more people than anything going on in Ukraine it it it is bizarre what what what these people and and economically look at them Europe is sinking between the United States on one hand and China on the other and it's it's a process that is becoming obvious you know we have our high-tech the Chinese match us the Europeans nothing nowhere I noticed that my friend uh Yannis Vu fakis goes around Europe explaining as a as a European Economist and a European political leader because he happens to be both uh that they you know he refers to Europe his continent as stupid I mean it's extra he's a very smart man I know him pretty well I read his work and and he but the only one just like he was the only one who understood that bailing out Greece wasn't bailing out Greece it was bailing out the French and British and German banks who are owed a lot of money which the government gave the European government gave to the Greek government on condition that would use it to pay back the banks it was Europe taking care of Europe at Greece's expense routing the money through and he had at least the courage to say so which is why they had to give rid of him I you know it you couldn't even allow it to be said but I think that's a crisis building very quick I think you're going to see real political turmoil in Europe because the existing just like here the existing Democrats and Republicans prepared the way for Mr Trump's theater you're seeing that same process in Europe and whether the the new face comes from the left which is what you have in France or it comes from the right which is what you have in Germany you're going to see the same basic story unfolding and it's going to be another nail in the coffin of the American Empire because its Junior partner Europe is going to become a tremendous problem and not much of an ally I think you're right Richard that the focus of what's considered to be the war in Ukraine has been Europe all along uh the war in Ukraine has not weakened Russia if anything as we've discussed it strengthened it but what it has done is uh amazingly weakened uh Europe now uh I don't think it's possible for any agreement to be made between uh Trump and uh Putin to settle uh the Ukrainian situation because the war is still still on when one side is winning a war is Russia's finally just cleaning up uh the uh Ukrainian Army uh there cannot be any such thing as a ceasefire or any uh plan for a post-war settlement because the settlement has to be made on the battlefield not uh diplomatically so all that uh Trump can do is say we're not going to spend any more American money on Ukraine uh that will be what he's doing and what he said is more uh you've had his uh uh one of his cabinet ministers saying uh that uh the uh if Europe really feels the what the NATO leader has said If America loses uh the war against Russia in Ukraine that uh Putin will March right through to the Atlantic ocean and uh destroy Europe uh and right and so a loss A a settling the fighting in Ukraine in anything less than a total NATO Victory is a total European loss so the uh uh the Trump uh cabinet has said well if that's the case if you want money and you want American Support uh you've got to uh buy enormous amounts of Trey bills uh and in fact you've got to pay the uh war in Ukraine what Trump has has says is this is not our war against Russia we want peace this is Europe's war against Russia Europe uh and uh NATO countries in Europe should pay for the war not us and of course uh how do you uh pay for war well you need arms and uh Europe's arms industry has been destroyed by the United States sanctions uh against Russia and uh so this means as we've discussed before here uh I think uh in the two weeks while you were gone an enormous payment to the United States by Europe uh a reduction in uh the Euro's um exchange rate and a rise in the Dollar's value against Europe you're having that especially now that the Federal Reserve here has been raising its interest rates to 4.8% for 10year treasuries there's an enormous inflow into the dollar and a rising dollar uh Trump I want to talk a bit about this balance of payments dimension of the War uh because this is going to be where a lot of the squeeze on the Trump Administration uh foreign policy is is going to come uh Trump has said I think uh uh incorrectly that he wants a low dollar value so that that will make American exports less expensive he's living in the past uh that was the case when American industry was competing with European and Asian and other industry that's not the case anymore we're de industrialized the uh the rest of the world is dependent on us oil and US farm products uh and it doesn't matter what the uh exchange rate is they have to pay whatever the price is uh the the actual effect of Trump's policies uh is going to say uh America has to be the financial winner imagine if uh America puts the tariffs uh that Trump has promised on against Europe not to mention Canada and Mexico that's going to reduce America's uh Imports and uh increase uh the uh the the balance of trade to further strengthen the dollar everything that Trump uh is trying to do to help what he says help the American economy is going to raise the price of the dollar against foreign currencies so much that this is going to destabilize the entire International Financial system for instance if the dollar goes up against the global South countries they're their debts uh are in dollars but their ability to pay the debts uh is in their their their own currency they will have to spend much more of their domestic budget to pay uh the dollar debts that they have or they'll have to default same problem is going to happen uh in Europe if Europe uh pays what president Trump is insisting that they pay for NATO for us arms for tariffs uh that are imposed on them then uh they're going to have to drastically cut back spending well a few days ago uh the uh military one of the military advisers of I think the German government said we need instead of a bank uh for social spending we uh given the fact that the German Constitution says you you can't run a budget deficit Beyond a marginal amount uh we have to have a a NATO War Bank they've actually suggested that uh uh Europe SE set up a special NATO War Bank to attract savings paying high interest rates in order to afford to spend the money on NATO the 5% of GDP this is paying 5% of the GDP for War uh against Russia in Ukraine is the equivalent of a 4 percentage Point decline in GDP uh this means that Europe will impose upon itself or will be imposed by Trump uh the equivalent of the 1929 crash in the United States Europe will be broke well I can imagine many of Trump's supporters saying this is great we're billionaires we can come in and buy Europe industry uh cheap we can buy European com companies cheap it's as if the the from Europe's perspective and the inspect perspective of many American investors the Ukraine war is all about uh checkmating Europe and permitting a huge takeover given the Illusion in uh Europe that uh Russia is going to invade uh and uh is somehow threatening Europe by exporting uh gas and oil and making it more dependent this uh this uh crazy narrative that is official policy that obviously is pushed by the American uh politicians over uh over there is is going to make Europe uh the the the most unstable of all of the areas that we've talked about even uh e even Mexico and the near East although I guess you could say uh there's going to be chaos everywhere uh in the next six months well the issue of Europe let me expand a little bit to make sure that people understand what Michael just said the exchange rate between the dollar and the Euro was about a dollar and two cents for a Euro the last two or three days it may be a doll three cents now that is already extremely low it means that all a European gets when a European wants to exchange Euros for for dollars is a doar and two cents for each Euro well that's a lot less than you could get for a Euro over most of the last 20 years this is a very big deal especially if it drops which it has very rarely done and not for long below parody but that's where it seems to be headed and that means relative to the history Europe is in terrible trouble because it does particularly Germany it depends on it on exports and it it's not attractive because of what the Euro isn't worth this is a you know a a serious problem for them with or without having to pay for the Ukraine war if it continues but let's assume that Michael is right and I think it points that way that we're not going to get a quick end to the Ukraine war although Mr Trump will try for it but we won't get it the Europeans have boxed themselves in they're committed to this their political careers depend on it but they are destroying their own economic viability if the United States acts as Trump has said to spend much less money on the war in in Ukraine which has already happened in the last year year of Mr Biden because of Republican opposition in the in the Congress then the Europeans are going to be in an incredible place they e either have to go along with a deal in Ukraine that makes all of their pronouncements about the life and death look like the the theater it always was that's a that's a death nail for their own political survival if on the other hand they have to pay much more for the war they will not be able to do that and afford their social welfare system and if they cut that which they've been doing they're going to provoke the extreme left and the extreme right which has already happened the extreme left in France the extreme right in Germany and that's going to undo them politically which means we have an either or whose net result is the same either way they cannot survive they cannot go to their people who are already unhappy with the Ukraine war barely supporting them and say it's now going to cost you your pension that would be Mr mron or a whole h most of Social Services that was Schultz they can't do that it's not a viable Arrangement and there's no golden Miracle that's going to come down the road and save them because the whole world is industrializing in place of Europe this is a very weird situation and notice that the emerging block in the world economy bricks is noteworthy because it's not about Europe Europe is outside the story The Bricks is the global South there was a rumor I believe it's true that a year or two ago Mr macron actually inquired whether France could join the bricks and he was told no thank you meanwhile last week Indonesia one of the largest countries in the world population 280 million people that's not much smaller than the United States join the bricks I mean the writing is on the wall you have to be blind not to see this is not good for Europe and Europe Remains the chief Ally of the United States it it is destroying its own allies and it can't figure out a way not to do it and it is irritated with obstacles to doing that and I think you're going to see growing anxiety in Europe with if Mr Trump is able to achieve even a small part of the only way forward he sees this is an accumulation I know this is beating the dead horse but we have to this is an accumulation of problems that haven't been solved the problem of the dollar the problem of balance of payments the problem of internal productivity the problem of changing global trade patterns and above all the emergence of China and its allies with their own agenda who are not held back by the kinds of problems that are affecting the west and that's the story of the decline of one Global regime and the emergence of another we are living through that but we shouldn't be so focused on each of the Little Steps in at risk of losing the larger picture well since you pointed out all these complications I might as well add another one uh there's one country uh that's uh just off the coast of Maine politically and that's Great Britain uh and uh in the last few days you've had the British prime minister sturmer uh go to uh oh I'm blocking out uh to try to start a war with Russia and aeran by going to Armenia and trying to sign a contract uh with with Armenia and to essentially uh weigh uh open a new military front uh in Armenia against uh aeran and Russia with the intention of stopping the uh oil uh Pipeline and belt and Road initiative uh that Russia and China are trying to uh extend uh uh Westward uh what will the United States uh and Trump do about uh uh Britain's U essentially Britain is uh doing what Netanyahu is doing it uh it it is trying to to uh Force America into a war uh with a larger power just like Netanyahu wants to drag America into war with Iran uh England wants to drag the United States into a war uh with Russia and azerbijan uh and probably spreading uh to Turkey as well I would imagine that uh if uh Putin and Trump sit down one of the first things that uh Putin is going to say about well you know you're talking about stopping um aggression but right now of the you're your English puppet is ex uh accelerating its aggression in Armenia what how can you stop that uh this is going to be a complicated factor that uh I think can can blow up just as much as uh Europe I don't consider England uh Britain to be really part of Europe politically and I think Europe has no desire ever to absorb Britain and but I just wanted to fill out all of the complicating chaos areas that we've discussed yeah and I think it just goes to tell you you know it underscores that we we are living at a time of mounting Global multiple economic problems that are the result of failure to deal with them for quite a while and now they are how shall I put it reinforcing or feeding one another so that what you can't do in maybe in in Central Asia worsens your problem in Europe or vice versa what what you can't do you know in Canada or Mexico makes other problems you have that much worse the grandiose notion of deporting tens of millions of people it's extraordinary the very idea of doing that no matter what happens shows you these are very extreme problems if you're thinking in these kinds of extreme terms about how to solve them even before you get to the feasibility look at the language look at the the the tone of of what it is you're going to do and if his his judicial appointments wage a Revenge war against Democrats if that part of the theater is taken seriously then we back to the point that Michael made earlier that the internal struggles in this Society add a whole another uncertainty as to the outcome of all of this there's no reason to expect that this country will be any further along in solving its problems after four more years of trump than it was after the first four years of trump or the next four years of Biden nothing is happening here that gives you the reason a sense we're going to be dealing with these problems in an effective way just if only things were that solvable Richard uh I don't think uh these are problems they're quandaries a problem has a solution a quandry doesn't in a quandry you're stuck there's nothing uh that you can do to solve the problem as it's formulated as it exists and the way that we've formulating the tensions and antagonisms at work I don't see any uh reasonable solution so I don't see any basis for how either I or you or anyone else can really forecast the kind of chaos that we're going to be seeing in the next half year to year yeah I think you're right I think I'm responding if I ask myself why I reason the way I do I'm responding to the fact that people ask me an awful lot as I'm sure they do with you too Michael uh and you too Nima well we're reasonable asking for Solutions so I feel like I ought to try to provide one but my own logic takes me to where you are which is wow this is quite a collection of of difficulties and I can see that we're going to have some remarkably weird ad hoc knee jerky kind of responses as the quandry makes itself felt uh in the minds of people to whom everyone is looking for Solutions as well I you know I don't even know if the Israeli government can survive another week under these conditions there are threats from at least several of the cabinet members to quit if Netanyahu accepts he seems to have accepted so we're wondering are they going to quit if they do his government Falls and then the question is what comes next and nobody quite knows what comes next if all the actors uh in Europe and Israel and uh Mexico and America were as reasonable as you and I are then uh the problems could be solved but uh and uh uh or even uh we could we would be able to uh to say here's a reasonable solution with a good chance of our forecast being right but how do you forecast people who are unreasonable and I think we're dealing with unreasonable people in Israel unreasonable people in Ukraine unreasonable uh leaders in Europe uh this is the problem that makes any kind of rational forecasting impossible and maybe I disagree at least a little bit here I think history blows away the people that you're describing I agree with you that those are the people they are very unreasonable they've been able to survive I don't see them being able to survive much longer that may be very that may be very naive on my part but I have this sense that in the end in ways I may be very horrified by the historical tensions we are now living through are going to blow a lot of these popular these politicians out of the water the inadequacy of their Theater which defines their whole careers will make them Persona nonr in their own societies and they will go into fi physical and emotional decline because they they've become totally you know irrelevant I understood Angela Merkel when she explained that the whole point of the deals made with Russia and so on in n in 2014 around Ukraine were understood to be PLO to give them the time to arm and equip the the the the Army there the Ukraine Army but I thought the admission was interesting that she now felt having become marginalized by all of what happened that she could and she should say that she knew what the consequences would be and they were what she thought they would be but she wanted she wanted you know the the way some people when they get close to dying feel the need to to say things they have kept secret for most of their lives I think that happens to these politicians too and that I I read it as a kind of admission that what she had been able to focus on and succeed at in Germany after unification was uh no longer possible that that the conditions in in Europe had changed and that the Germany upward and onward as the PowerHouse of the European economy as the great exporter of the capitalist world this was done I mean that between what had happened what the Chinese did and the change in the United States and the declining Western Empire you know Germany was caught and Germany has been caught ever since the decline of Germany from being the engine of the European economy to now being among the worst performers of the European economies currently either in recession or very close there too I mean that is an extraordinary Comedown and no one sees a reversal of this I think what you said a minute ago is quite correct uh not naive at all the current current actors in uh the world political stage will be gone during the year they cannot survive uh in the melstrom that were going to be seen uh and in fact they have to be gone in order for any resolution to take place yeah which my my guess is probably bothers them if not during their waking hours than in their nightmares just to wrap up this session Richard and Michael how do you see the situation in Germany right now Elon Musk is trying to support IFD alternative for Germany and he says that what I'm doing in Germany is against what sorus is doing in Europe he tries to legitimize what he's doing in Germany and is that of concern these people are interfering in the internal affairs of a foreign country which doesn't have any sort of connection with them and they don't care about Germany after all why are they doing this well you know Mr Mr musk is now if I've understood the the numbers correctly the private owner of something around $400 billion okay uh um if that's invested at 5% the man earns 20 billion a year on the 400 billion he owns $20 billion a year is around $400 million if I have it correctly a week which means what he had to pay to buy the the Trump government was two days worth of his income so he can afford to buy any and every government that's for sale in the world without it making a material difference in his total wealth nor much of a dent on the accumulation of more wealth based on that wealth so he is doing the logic of capitalism it capitalism has always been a system that produces and reproduces unequal distributions of wealth which are used to buy unequal distributions of power because that's the only way to guarantee the survival of the unequal distribution of wealth so we know how it works because it has worked that excuse me that way both before and during capitalism this is just the end result you have now produced enough so that an individual can buy multiple governments Mr musk has now bought the American government and he has made major moves to buy the Canadian the Argentinian and now the German government and those are rich countries most other countries are cheaper for him to buy and he may have bought them I don't you know I don't follow him that closely but he played a major role in Argentina to support mle who's going to have a large difficulty surviving Mr Trudeau whom he basically helped knock off and now Mr Schulz whom he's working hard to defeat and I think yes all those political forces will have big debts to Mr musk which he will collect on and that will make him more wealthy and so he can buy more but that's how this works and the the liberals who moan and groan about all of this are are just fakers they're the ones who can't find the the Common Thread here because it traces itself back to KL Marx of course they has to be a taboo they all know what's going on many of them are competing for Mr musk's money as they speak and George Soros that's a that's childish you know that that's a convenient Whipping Boy in half a dozen countries either because he he he funded a lot of anti-russian activity at one point so he endeared himself to them then he funds anti-communist activity that endear him to the right and he he funds anti-leftist stuff that endear him more to the right you know this is this not serious that he's just looking for the that covers the money what he has is money and that's basically all he has and that's what he's using and but he he has the money in a system which values the money Above All Else so puts him in a very powerful position and there's no opposition that I can see it's extraordinary the level of corruption if by that you mean the dependence of the political system on the richest entities that they supposedly govern that has been going on for so long that it has become routine and normalized and accept and he gets away with being only the most extreme example but the idea of it has long been accepted that's what Michael meant before when he referred to Citizens United or any of the other legislative steps and regulations in one country or another that allow the money to make the difference I it is really it's it it makes the commitment of what is it called now Valu driven an international value driven system such an absurd joke such a horrible irony perpetrated on the people I mean we don't have a value driven International System we have an international system that is totally for sale and is being being purchased by the richest Among Us which is how a market system works you know as people like Michael and me when we teach we explain to to an audience what is so Elemental that the only really interesting question is why do you have to explain this to people it's like explaining in the morning the sun comes up well you know shouldn't come as much of a surprise a market is a A system that when there's a scarcity of goods allocates the scarcity to those who have the most money because a scarcity a demand greater than Supply which is all that scarcity ever meant when there's a demand greater than Supply you don't distribute the supply according to people's needs according to people's work according to people's contribution you distributed by having the price be bid up so only the richest can afford it and there is no ethical or moral system that I know of that justifies doing that the rich person gets the scarce milk to feed their cat while the poor person goes without the milk needed to feed their children that's the way the market works well that chaos is probably a good point to end the whole discussion yes that thank you so much for being with us today Richard Michael great pleasure as always glad to be back and uh enjoy these very much yeah see you byebye
