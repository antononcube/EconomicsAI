hi everybody Today is Thursday March 20th 2025 and our friends Michael Hodson and Richard W are back with us Welcome back Let's get started with what has happened in the United States Richard if you remember when this when the Trump administration with when Donald Trump decided to be the next president decided to be part of the presidential election he was talking about the US economy We are going down We are getting destroyed by right and left and by China and all of that And he's now in office in Washington and decision he's making in terms of the foreign policy of the United States He got back just two days ago to the Middle East fighting Yemenes is it seems that he's not that much successful with the way that he was he told us he's going to deal with Russia in Ukraine How do you see the way that he's running the foreign policy of the United States well as usual the foreign policy of the United States like that of many countries is a pale second to their domestic policies often shaped by responding to and ultimately determined by their domestic situation And I think uh you're going to see that uh as well Uh let me do it by an example actually drawn from Europe Uh Europe is behaving in a very bizarre way It's behaving for example by say saying something that is silly that they are going to fight Russia without the United States and as I would be interested in pursuing My guess is that the uh strikes by Ukraine into Russia over the last two or three weeks are an activity undertaken by Britain and France and Germany not by Ukraine Uh this is a way for them to do three things demonstrate that they can do military action as well or better than they did with the United States That's not true But it it is a public display that allows them to behave as if they had that capability Number one Number two it is necessary to justify uh hostility with Russia is necessary to justify the building up of their own defense forces which they are all about to do Or at least the Germans have already done it in the votes they took earlier this week to do two things that Germany had vowed not to do and in particular that Christian Merz the new leader of Germany had campaigned he would not do He campaigned he would not increase the national debt of Germany He just led the way to increase the national debt of Germany in order to rearm Germany at a pretty hefty pace It's not a hefty pace in terms of the military of the United States Russia and China which it will take Germany a long time to equal let alone threaten So this is a theater more than it is a reality at this point But it is a necessary game to play to be active in Ukraine to justify helping Ukraine to justify military buildup and to keep going The one political idea of the governments of Europe since the Second World War the single most important idea is that they are a bull work against the Soviet Union That's why NATO was created That's why the rearmament that's why the Marshall Plan all of it and the European politicians And I want to remind people that the the political leaders of Europe from the Scandinavians in the north to the Italians and Greeks in the south were systematically trained funded and chosen by the United States's State Department CIA and all of that Periodically it was exposed but it was always going on You you wanted the United States wanted Western Europe to do for the West and America what the U the Russians the Soviets wanted Eastern Europe to do from Poland in the north to Bulgaria in the F and that's how the World War II ended and that's how it was divided up So you have to remember that everything about Europe since the second world war has been within the context of its strategic location in the American mentality because the United States was such a dominant uh player and that's exactly what is now disappearing That's why our times now are so tumultuous and why we're having trouble understanding them because a constant story 1945 to 2020 is falling apart is no longer there But let's go back So what did the Europeans do they cut a deal with the United States And this will shed light on the American foreign policy and its relationship to our economic situation It was a deal The United States and Europe were afraid of the same two things They were afraid of the Soviet Union because of what it had achieved in World War II as crucial to the defeat of Nazis as anybody else if not more so And they were also afraid of the extraordinary rise in the power of left-wing socialist communist Keynesian uh forces in their own country That had never been seen before the the at the end of World War II the Communist parties of Western Europe and the United States the Socialist parties of comm of Europe and the United States were stronger than they had ever been before In the United States they were stronger because they were the militants who worked with the CIO to get the New Deal and they had all the prestige Roosevelt was their choice and Roosevelt was reelected president three times I mean no one had ever achieved that political power that concentrated for that long You have to remember that That was number one Number two there was a terrible anxiety that the war when it was over would mean the demobilization of the military and the closing of the factories making guns and planes and missiles cuz you didn't need them anymore And if that happened wouldn't you risk being plunged back into the Great Depression which is where the war broke in in the first place so it was logical That's why they passed the housing bill the GI Bill to take all those returning soldiers and stick them in a university rather than have them be part of the army of the unemployed etc etc etc So there was great fear of the depression of the already strengthened socialist and communist parties In Europe was the same They were afraid of the return of the depression but they had an extra problem In their countries they had been occupied by the Nazis and they had developed very powerful resistance organizations in Norway in Italy and everywhere between And the leaders of that resistance communists and socialists making those parties and their leaders very popular They were the national heroes against the Nazis This was a combination had to be handled somehow And here's how it was handled You took Keynesian ideas and you developed we can do canes but we can do it military We we'll have all the deficit spending we need but it'll be for the military We'll do that here in the United States And we will create an umbrella for the Europeans And we will say to the Europeans we we've got the nuclear bombs We're willing to bomb Russia Look what we did in Japan Blah blah blah All of that and we'll take care of that and that will save you all money You don't have to have a military You don't really I mean a little one but you don't have to worry about this And they haven't ever worried about it That's why they're so impotent now They can't do anything Uh we'll take care of it And the money you would have had to spend on the military here's what you do You give your working classes uh a standard of social service equal or better than what they get in the Soviet Union to undercut the appeal of the you don't need socialists and communists We'll do it That's why there's free health care That's why there's free colleges That's why there's paid vacation for five weeks in most Western European countries Something United States has never enjoyed they have had now for 50 years right incredible But that's how that was done You could leave their rich people very rich You wouldn't have to tax them You use the money you tax from the masses to provide them with social services uh on a reasonable scale That will blunt the appeal of socialists and communists The government of the United States trained and equipped and funded their leaders all the Christian democratic they went to the United States like a rotating uh seminar right periodically was exposed that the prime minister of Italy or the prime minister of Austria had been funded by something in the United States of course it was a package and here's the problem that package is no longer sustainable it doesn't work It can't proceed as it has And no one knew still doesn't how exactly to fix all of this But one idea here we go now One idea is to rethink the whole relationship with Russia I mean it is relevant if you think about it that they got rid of the Soviet Union back in 1989 1990 Here we are 30 years later and they're kind of catching up Gee if they're not a socialist or communist country whatever that meant why are we having any different relationship to them than we have to all the other countries that are governed by pro- capitalist leaderships you know and Trump for God knows what reasons that we will never understand because they're secret and they will be for a long time Mr Trump is the one to say "Well you know uh the emperor has no clothes I'm going to try to cut a deal with these people and I'm not going to be held back by by all of you cold warriors because that's what they were." Just like the leaders of Europe have been living in this world for 50 years So has Mr Biden who was literally a senator of that process for 50 years So yeah of course he's the he can't make the break You need a Trump to make the break But the problems of the United States by this time are far bigger than anything Mr Trump can do with or without Russia That's what none of them are able to cognize That's that's why Michael and I have an audience I think and certainly we have a lot to talk about because this country faces its decline by denying it's happening So that creates a window for people like us to simply say in a way like Trump said about Russia what are we doing here we're refusing to face the reality the and here's here's some of the key things For the first time in a century the United States has a real competitor We're not facing any of that China is a competitor Way more than Russia ever was Russia was a poor backward country from 1917 through the entire Cold War period They got an impressive military They devoted an enormous set of resources to doing that And they did that well And they did other things well too But they were coming from a place that made them no competitor at all And after World War II the rest of the capitalist world was no competitor either Gave the United States an absolutely bizarre independence in which it could indulge whatever the hell it wanted I mean exaggerating but to give you the flavor that's all over I mean today if I heard to correctly Nema I believe you mentioned it also You know the BYD you know which I learned recently stands for build your dream The BYD Corporation has now come up with a new lithium battery for uh electric vehicles that blows everybody out of the water We're going to have those every 3 weeks I mean not just from that company and not just in that industry but but that's what it means to have a competitor And then when you begin to add that in this country because it is being it is declining and because the competitor is taking the market they are they're crunching in They are shrinking Look we are closing universities in this country The Chinese open a new one every month You know I I could give you a hundred but that's what you get with a decline of one industry versus another or one region versus another or now with the United States and not just China but look at the alliance the bricks that they've built And the bricks has already shown itself to be a very powerful geopolitical force because it allowed Russia to find new customers for the oil and gas thereby nullifying the whole sanctions program which was dead on arrival because of the new configuration of the world economy So what the United States is now trying to do is in my judgment an act of total desperation It is reverting from the neoliberal globalization mantra to the nationalist economic mantra privatize what you can at home and then have the government be the protector militarily with every kind of device to help a corporation not to tax it for anything Have the government keep out the competitor if you can It's a desperate effort to survive and it's too little and it's too late They may have been able to pull it off earlier but I don't think they can do it anymore And as that becomes clear as for example with this lithium battery another defeat you're going to see more and more desperate on a different uh program They asked me to come up with a metaphor and I stri tried and the only one I came up with I think is any good is the metaphor from football of the so-called hail Mary pass when a team is losing and it's desperate only got a few seconds or minutes to go There is a custom in which the the quarterback takes the ball and heaves it to a corner of the field and tells all of his teammates who are allowed to catch a ball be at that corner 26 seconds from now you know and I'm going to throw it down there and it'll bounce around as everybody tries to get their hand on it And as it bounces around maybe you will be the one to clutch it to your chest and we win the game because you caught the pass But it you've given up on strategy You've given up on this is luck This is the you're doing the equivalent of saying a Hail Mary to the in the Catholic Church or flipping a coin you you're done And that's what we're we we are now we are engaged in the Hail Mary and and that's what m Mr Trump keeps throwing the ball hoping somehow because the contradictions are now overwhelming If you put tariffs you risk an inflation If you have an inflation you nullify your political base If you have an inflation at the same time that a recession comes in and then you got stagflation about which we're hearing again a lot because people are realizing it's coming you know how are you going to how you going to manage all of these things and and if you have retaliation which it looks like you're going to have um then all bets are off and the United States you know we're going to relearn the lesson after World War I and in the inter war period between one and two you had this kind of surge of nationalism and it didn't work and it was later understood that it contributed to the Great Depression It was a terrible mistake but by that it was too late and I think you w you're going down exactly the same path now Michael go ahead Well Richard when you describe all of the hope uh and the plans that the United States had when it emerged from uh World War II you realize how it's uh operating philosophy and its economy has turned in to the diametric opposite Uh and you've been explaining some of the ways of this Uh in 1945 the United States promised to support the integration of world trade uh and that's because it was going to dominate uh world trade because it had most of the manufacturing and export capacity Uh it was going to ensure world peace as you pointed out with its military That's because it had uh the primary uh military power and the atom bomb uh and that was the basis for the United Nations and its international law Uh then the United States had gimmicked and structured the international law of the international monetary fund to base the uh international financial system in a way that favored the United States and dissolved the British Empire which was its main rival at that time dissolved any kind of uh British or French imperial preference for their colonies and essentially made uh other countries increasingly dependent on the United States for their agriculture as well as for their industry uh and for their arms Uh and that seemed to be the dream But to let's look at today everything's the opposite The United States no longer is based on what it can offer the world And Trump realizes that it has only one form of persuasion threats and coercion This is not a Hail Mary pass This is something a way of somehow threatening the other side of your football game We're going to injure you and uh hurt your uh quarterback and take him out of action uh if uh and we're going to win by brutality And this coercion uh and policy insists that the Americans must get the better of any trade or international deal It's going to not be a win-win like uh what underlies China's uh trade uh strategy It's a loss for other countries And uh just uh yesterday or maybe it was today's morning uh Treasury Secretary uh Basant said that uh the the Biden sanctions against Russia really are very passive Trump is preparing new sanctions against uh Russia to try to hurt as beyond anything that the Biden administration had thought of That's what the Treasury Secretary said So in other words without being able to offer an expansion of world trade military protection or uh even uh a a secure financial uh dollar the United States says what we do have is the ability to threaten and hurt other countries and to organize sanctions and uh break up uh the uh unified world that seemed to be in the process proess of being created under US leadership back in 1945 Uh it's trying to disrupt trade and financial linkages in order to center them all on the United States or under US ownership Uh for instance uh Trump's recent uh aim of taking the Panama Canal away from its uh Chinese owners uh in Hong Kong Uh President Xi uh got quite upset uh he said be by the fact that these owners sold out to uh uh to the US uh company Black Rockck I think Uh but they said look uh if we don't sell out then uh Trump's just going to come in with the military and uh take it away and we're not going to have anything He's threatened to invade uh Panama Uh and there goes our our holding We don't want to end up with anything Uh President Xi do you want to buy do you want to top their offer do you want to pay a quarter billion dollars or whatever it is and then uh you'll try to uh fight uh uh Trump on uh on his territory Well uh the Chinese government said "Well we'd hope to trade off uh uh uh this Panama Canal by letting you sell uh to foreign countries and uh get some kind of uh benefit from the United States in return." And now we don't get a benefit and the Hong Kong company said "Well uh there never uh there never was going to be a real threat of resistance to the United States simply taking over So the United States has reverted to Britain's old strategy of maintaining dominance by dividing and conquer China is trying to uh create uh a win-win expansion for itself and the rest of Asia by the Belt and Road Initiative The United States is trying to break up the Bel and Road Initiative Uh and whereas China is trying to uh base this initiative at least for seagoing uh trade on on port development the United States is trying to take the ports away from China or foreclosing this Where uh China is trying to develop pipelines uh oil pipelines to Russia and other places the United States is trying to say well that's going to have to go through countries and we're going to work with these countries to prevent your pipelines or railroads for going through these countries We're going to try to prevent the world from being integrated So uh it's going to be a wheel and spokes all focused on the United States not an overall economic system Well uh this what's happened in trade has happened in finance Uh in 1945 the United States emerged from World War II with 75% of the world's gold supply And uh gold continued to flow to the United States until 1950 uh by which time the United States had 80% of all the world's monetary gold that is the gold held by central banks as their foreign reserves What reversed all that was the beginning of the war economy that you pointed out The Korean War uh opened in 1950 1951 and ever since the United States has uh run a balance of payments deficit that finally led to uh forced the United States off gold in 1971 and continues uh to be uh an enormous cost that unlike the case uh in the 1940s and 50s and 60s uh cannot be financed by America's trade and financial uh surplus uh anymore because America's de-industrialized by financializing So the United States is in a position uh this is not like a football game anymore We're talking about two different strategies The United States has said well China and Asia are trying to uh rise to dominance by ha uh h being the source of the world's raw materials and industry working them up uh of energy of technological innovation What do we have finance and meaning asset price inflation to uh to provide stock market gains and bond market gains and uh uh inflate real estate prices for real estate gains just like uh in England uh real estate went way up uh after the Russian economy was destroyed by the kleptocrats buying uh uh products there So uh the whole strategy of sanctions again is to destroy other countries and deny deny them the ability of trying to develop themselves with uh with a kind of dream that it can somehow reindustrialize and restore the seeming what seems to be a utopia right now of what it had in 1945 5 But that's what's so crazy Uh it it doesn't have the industrial power to do that And that Trump has uh an industrial strategy of uh e whether it's a devaluation of the dollar or support of the dollar that uh he thinks somehow is going to lead to uh new factories being created here uh Germany and uh France and other countries will relocate their production in the United States but it takes many years to build a factory and to put uh to put in place a supply line for the factory and a marketing distribution plan There is no way that in the immediate future during uh Trump's administration the United States can get any even begin to re-industrialize uh in practice uh so that uh the uh the United States essentially doesn't have any plan at all There's not even a Hail Mary pass There's uh there are some bizarre uh u suggestions uh that I can get over I guess in the next part of the discussion But for Trump's team a multipolar world uh that now you have the foreign secretary uh talking acknowledging that we're in that that means one that's divided and conquered not an integrated system of multipolar It means just uh divided and conquered uh when there's really still only one pole and that's the United States And the result of that is chaos not uh consolidation So the question is why don't other countries withdraw from its orbit uh well what makes things uh so bizarre is that they're not doing that They're they're going along with uh uh letting Trump take the initiative without having any guiding philosophy So there is no way that other countries can even anticipate what the United States foreign policy can be And I don't think either of us can even guess what it would be Uh on the one hand Trump wants a strong dollar uh to prevent other currencies or gold from becoming vehicles On the other hand he thinks that a weak dollar is going to help exports uh and make our exports of industrial products cheaper But if the United States is not producing industrial goods to export how does currency depreciation help uh when you're there's nothing to uh lower the exchange rate for uh Trump says that tariff pro protection in other words another barrier to international trade reversing the whole free trade movement of 1945 He says tariff protection is going to promote new industrial investment and employment But again it takes so many years to do that that the world is changing so rapidly that uh the United States mode of industrial investment is mainly to make money financially not industrially It's like the military uh making the uh uh the airplanes and the weapons uh not really to be able to fight against Russia And you had the uh F-14 I think shot down uh a day or two ago uh over Ukraine uh by the Russian planes that were militarily superior while uh costing maybe 10% uh to do Uh Trump says he wants perpetual bonds uh to other countries if they buy US securities they're not these securities can't be redeemed for a century In other words uh you'll you're going to lock in you're going to just stop the world from being able to dd dollararize to move away from the dollar to become uh independent of the dollar He's he's trying to do everything he can to stop the uh independence And uh as we've seen militarily we're we're seeing the whole fight in the near east now saying "Well at least we can control the world's oil and it its uh uh its international trade." So I I I think when when you when you juxtapose what the strategy is today and the policy and how it has reversed everything in 1945 why is Europe gone along with what does the United States have to offer the world anymore uh I can't figure it out And uh uh all that uh the United States and NATO have is a narrative that well we're protecting against Russia uh sending 10 million troops to occupy Europe again as if Russia really wants Europe and uh the whole fantasy of Russia as a threat So we're back to uh what you described in 1945 uh the Russian threat Uh but it's it's a fiction now the the world of 1945 no longer exists and the United States is living in it And the question is how long can it try to convince the rest of the world to remember the myth uh and the hopes back then not look at the present By the way the fighter jet that was shot down was F6 Michael 16 Yes Who Who's keeping track you're right Richard go ahead Yeah I think again as I have said I agree with what Michael is saying and I I'll rethink my Hail Mary and see if I can come up with a with a better uh metaphor I think where we agree crucially with or without Hail Mary is that it's very hard to discern from the chaotic behavior of Mr Trump what in the world the plan quote unquote is what you're getting I'm going to give you two or three examples If you are going to throw tariffs around as a major tool of policy then you are inviting other countries to do two things retaliate with tariffs of their own but start seriously to look for ways to insulate themselves from the obvious vulnerability that you have exposed by hitting them with a tariff If Canada sends electricity to the United States in large quantities and lives off of it and the United States is in a position which they have known I mean it doesn't take advanced degrees in economics to know that if you're selling a large portion of whatever it is you produce to one buyer and that one buyer chooses not to play the game you're going to be in trouble That's not that's not all that comp What are they going to do now and and and here's the answer They're going to go to the next best likely buyer in the hopes that they can get a better deal And that next likely buyer for example electricity from Canada is China And what does that mean and whatever the ch the Canadians say or don't say that's the reality that they face would make no sense to go to Europe given the conditions there The United States has told them I'm we're going to abuse you So what's left is China and the bricks in some way or other That's a part of the world that needs energy Canada is part of the world that produces energy Okay we can see where it is going And that's that's a more dominant storyline than what Mr Trump can do And then there's what Mr Trump is actually doing If you are a capitalist and you have a factory this is sort of spelling out what Michael said and you have a factory in Mexico and you you spent five years and 10 billion dollars developing the infrastructure and the factory and the labor force and all of the things And why did you do it because of NAFTA You did it because you can produce low-wage workers in Mexico and then ship it 200 miles into Texas and there's no uh no tariff no duty Okay Now Mr Tariff says we're changing and Mr Trump says we're changing everything in order to get that factory to move to Texas That's not going to happen And I'll tell you why The vice president in charge of plant location wouldn't dare move the factory to Texas to spend another billion dollars because it's very expensive to do Take another year or two or three when you're not in the business cuz you're building a factory You can't you can't deliver your orders because of that And then the risk that this bizarre president whose opposition seems to be getting stronger almost every day he may reverse himself He already has reversed himself more than once on these tariffs I'm going to initiate an expensive move that could be rendered absurd next week or next month or next year I'm not going to do that Part of the talk of a recession coming now is corporations are are suspending investment projects because they can't they can't see what to do They can't make the decision Build it in Mexico or build it in New York or build it in Nigeria or wherever their options are That decision is now impossible to make And they don't have any courage They know that if if they make an investment and it turns out to be the wrong one and their competitor chose a different option and that turned out to be the right one their career is done They're not going to do that They're going to wait That's more safe playing within the corporate universe This is a a concrete way of showing what Michael meant when he said you can't overnight Mr Trump who's only going to be president for another three and a half years he's going to be a lame duck the second half of that period anyway And if he loses a significant number of the supporters because his margin in the in the House of Representatives very small he lose half a dozen seats in the House of Representative becomes a Democratic place They'll stall everything he tries to do and and then and then every decision made by a corporate executive now looks ridiculous 18 months from you you can't function you can't do this you know now people have asked me well is it impossible well then I come back to my Hail Mary no I mean if the if the tariffs don't get retaliated if something independent that happens in Europe or Asia that I didn't foresee Could all of this in some magical way yeah Like a Hail Mary P The ball could come down just in the person you hoped it would Is that 100% impossible no Not very likely Not something you'd want to bet on but not impossible either And that's what an awful lot of these presidents hope for And I think when you have an empire going down that's what the period what the people who are in charge of those empires as they go down that's what they're reduced to They can't control it In this country they can't control it because they don't even admit it but there is a chance And that's what they hope for They hope that there's a chance But that's what we're living with And the sense that Americans have and the sense I'm sure is in the minds of many of the people watching this program that things are very chaotic that things are very loose that that we don't know from one day and that the leaders don't seem to that's a correct perception That's a very good understanding even if it isn't tutored and doesn't have the statistics to back it up The instinct there is an accurate one Well Michael the magic word you used was bizarre uh when it comes to Trump and uh there is something approximating your hill Mary pass Yesterday uh Vice President Vance put a video up on Expost Uh and uh he I think states the US strategy back in 1945 in more naked terms than you or I have done What he said quote the idea of globalization was that rich countries would move further up the value chain while the poorer countries made the simpler things But then he added "It didn't work out that way." And he said "That's a tragedy that it didn't work out that way It meant globalization was a failure because the whole form of globalization that was planned in 1945 was to polarize the economy not to make uh countries economically equal as uh academic free trade theory pretends with its unrealistic uh assumptions But to uh essentially replace colonialism and military force with economic pressures sanctions and a biased structuring of the laws of international trade and payments and finance uh in a way that maintains the inequality Well what happened with uh uh first NAFTA and then later in uh the Clinton administration the admission of China into the WTO was that China succeeded much better than expected Uh it didn't simply produce uh low uh low uh labor uh products It moved up the value chain Exactly what Vance said was the aim of us to oppose Uh it was moving up and instead of maintaining global inequality China moved along with the rest of Asia and said look we have uh a a plan of development that incidentally is the exact same plan uh of development that made the United States rich in the 19th century uh protective tariffs uh government subsidy government infrastructure spending and above all keeping finance as a public utility not letting it become a separate uh uh sector uh at war with industrialization So uh you you you have this again the strategy of being able to hurt other countries to maintain the um uh the system of trade and development that benefits the United States That's what's so uh bizarre about it And it's bizarre to think that somehow the United States can uh go back to following the Chinese model which means its own 19th century model that Trump says that he loves uh McKinley and uh the whole flowering of US industrialization that was very largely based on government infrastructure investment uh uh for uh transportation communications uh schooling uh all of the things that we consider to be basic uh human needs and basic human rights um so that they would not be monopolized by rent seekers uh backed by Wall Street and the financial sector Uh but uh for Trump all of a sudden this whole system of development that uh China's doing and that America initially did and that Germany did in the 19th century France uh followed to some extent and that England had done earlier uh all of that is somehow uh reduced to a one-dimensional slogan tariffs And Trump says "If we can finance the United States uh budget deficit by tariffs then uh we won't have to tax the uh tax the rich We won't have to tax my supporters the donor class the financial class the finance insurance and real estate fire sector uh who who will bear the uh the cost uh he thought that other countries would have to bear the cost of tariffs to uh to finance uh the the US budget but in practice it'll be the American consumers Well uh Nema's question was what's the effect on the economy following this idea of making uh foreign countries pay to support an American empire and the economic strategy of American empire uh by means of uh imposing barriers tariff barriers sanctions financial barriers uh uh financial tariffs on foreign investment in the United States is one of the things that Trump has said Why only put tariffs on goods why not stop other countries from trying to uh invest in stocks and bonds why do we want to give them a chance to make money on American finance let's uh make them pay a tariff uh a charge uh super uh rent charge on this All of this is uh exactly the reverse of what really happened in the McKinley era What really happened in American industrialization and uh what China has showed worked today The one thing that the Americans are not going to do is succeed in the way that China and Asia uh and even uh Russia in its economic reorganization are succeeding by a mixed public private economy aimed at raising living standards educational levels productivity uh self-sufficiency uh the this is the essence of how a logical development plan would be That is exactly what the United States has ruled out So u one wonders why uh yesterday and today the stock market's going up as we're seeing uh the threat of uh trying to enforce all of this uh uh bizarre policy by military means in uh the Middle East for instance I also let me add that there's a kind of lesson here in Marx's old idea about uneven development The ideological framework here because they can't face the realities that we're trying to get at in our conversation They have to deny all of that you know instead of understanding what Chinese competition means they are presented as a cheater and an aggressor and you know all of this BS that wastess everybody's time I mean I understand its ideological function but it seems to me they don't really understand what they're doing So listening to Michael you use tariffs you use sanctions you are a bully you are trying to control It's the opposite of the neocclassical economics dream of an automatic mechanism in which everybody looking out for their own self-interest will end up producing the optimum for the society as a whole which is what the economics profession teaches mostly to itself Here's the irony It leads you to make one blunder after another Yesterday um Elon Musk made a statement about how enthusiastic he is for the privatization of Amtrak and the post office and in his discussion apparently cited the fact I it's almost embarrassing to say this but that they aren't profitable and if only they were privatized you see then they would be driven by a profit maximizing capitalist So I find you know I'm being asked about this on television I find myself having to explain to the television host a person less scholarly than you are Nema by a lot and explain to him no you you  they make no profit because they have low prices and the low prices charged by the post office and Amtrak are a subsidy to every private capitalist who uses the railroad and the post office which is everyone This is a government subsidy program to private enterprise And if you privatized it you would remove the subsidy And unless you can show me that the profits that would be earned by the railroads and the post office in their enormity and in their social consequences are greater than all the losses that businesses would suffer who would suddenly have to pay more for the electric for the railroad and the postal And the point is he's so ignorant Mr Musk that there is a culture that he's part of I don't think it's unique to him in which you babble the old mantra private is better than public Even in the middle of a program which as Michael has pointed out raises the public sanctions tariffs public intervention is the name of the game of Trump Look what he's doing to the federal employees He's just firing them That's a governmental intrusion Everything they do is nationalist management sanction you know bullying Meanwhile they inone they inone the mantra of privatization It is extraordinary And there's no you don't see in their faces or in their articulations any awareness of the absurdity of what is being said here You know China is our enemy because of the enormous power of the government the state the communist party And what is it they're doing they are giving enormous extra power to the state to the government and to the the Trump party which is it is a joke It is a joke How do you do how do you manage maybe this is my question to the two of you How do you manage to understand that among the bizarre things we are living through is a bizarre disconnect between the articulated philosophy we are part of and what these people are actually doing every day Well here's the missing word from uh what you've been describing uh Richard economic rent Uh if you privatize Amtrak and Post Office uh they're not going to be making more profits They're making monopoly rent defined as the excess of market price that they charge over and above the cost of production Now right now the United States uh has been subsidizing uh these u basic public utilities in order to sell them even below the cost of production So as you said this makes the private sector operate on a lower cost basis So the effect of creating monopoly rents is going to turn the United States into an economy where uh it's very much like uh Britain's fight against the landlords that led to Adam Smith and John Stewart Mill and all of the classical economists to say the objective of industrial capitalism is to get rid of economic rents What the Trump administration and Vancer is saying this is the end of industrial capitalism We have now gone beyond it by going backwards We are going back to pre-capitalist economic formations We're going back to the monopoly rents under feudalism We're going back to predatory finance that industrial capitalism was supposed to go beyond by essentially industrializing the financial system Instead finance uh uh the what has happened is that industry's been financialized just the reverse So we're reversing the entire strategy by which industrial capitalism took off in the 19th century And that's why the one word that cannot be said is economic rent as distinct from profit That is what uh what explains what is after because the uh Wall Street and the financial investors are looking for uh opportunities to create economic rent by privatization uh companies will borrow money from the financial sector to buy uh Amtrak in the post office That will add debt service to the cost of Amtrak and post office They will already uh have to pay the existing uh cost of production the full cost uh without uh any subsidy uh or loss And because they're monopolies they can charge whatever they want And uh essentially Amtrak in the post office in America will be America's uh uh version of Temp's water in England that has vastly increased uh water costs uh to England uh all by uh and Temp's water has taken a company that had zero debt when it began and it's now has so much debt it's in bankruptcy proceedings with the government and asking for another bailout saying if you don't uh because we've spent all the money on debt ser on paying uh the financial backers uh instead of cleaning up the water supply you've got to give us more money so finally we can begin to do what we'd promised to do in the first place so I think you can think of Donald Trump and Vance as America's v versions of Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan Do we really want to go back to that well yes we do says uh the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal and the mainstream media So that I think what we what I I want what we've been doing on this show with Nema is presenting uh a different narrative an alternative narrative to uh the self-destructive narrative that we're getting from uh uh the Trump administration the Biden administration the Obama administration before that uh the whole narrative that has uh has uh essentially destroyed America's industrial capitalism It's not socialism Yeah The irony you know in not to be professorial here but then again you know Michael and I are what we are Good old Karl Marx distinguished between money lending capitalist merchant capitalist and industrial capitalist and the whole point and all through uh his three volumes of capital that's crucial Volume one is about the industrial capitalist and then volumes two and three take us how they connect to the other but there's a crucial difference that he makes crystal clear when you lend money as a capitalist you know you lend a 100 you get back 105 the extra five you got is not an extra output that the society produced it's just that the deal is I give you X you got to give me more than X back it's a redistribution of what exa already exists The same thing with merchant I buy something I then resell it at a higher price I haven't done anything I've just bought and sold the same thing But the whole difference of industrial is when you use your money not to lend it not to buy and resell something but instead to buy a worker to buy a machine to buy raw materials and actually produce And then Markx shows us more value than you started with So if you want to understand economic growth and you don't want want to understand provisioning of a growing population you've got to if we understood that then we would not be able to say well let the market go the way it wants because if you do you get a a a system like ours in which we see lots of merchant capital and lots of money lending capital but a shrinking share of the industrial and it would have worried us more What about what is this imbalance happening is this a pro we've been better Marxists than decades ago that would have become a conversation in the United States rather than being handled as a misunderstanding which is how the neocclassical establishment uh handled this that this was in the nature of efficiency to have things go like this and not understanding that's you know it's a lesson in how what theory of economics you use will have an enormous impact on how whether and how you understand your situation and what kind of policies you do or do not pursue We are living the fruits of a very non an and an anti-Marxist approach because that could never be part of the national conversation you know as a feature of the cold war Well understanding the situation means how to conceptualize it And Trump's team has said well uh we're going to redefine gross national product and what the economy is doing We're going to get exclude government Why well if we sell off Amdra in the post office the government's going to uh shrink and uh if uh what Musk is doing is cutting up government slashing and burning shrinking and that would mean GD GDP is going down and he said so we're going to show that yes government's going down but the non-government private sector of GDP is going up but how is it going up uh with Amtrak and the post office it's not going up by uh actually producing more uh Amtrak services or more uh post office services It's going up by economic rent And economic rent and interest charges are not a product They're a transfer payment And so the uh I I I if we could somehow get a group that was willing to go through the accounting practice of saying okay how much of our GDP is actually a product and how much is not a product at all but just economic rent uh price without value product is supposed to be the value of the economy but instead it's uh just the price of the economy with economic rent this is uh the opposite of everything the classical economics Adams myth etc uh were really all about So I think uh uh what uh we're when we talk about Marx we're talking about uh uh the uh marks who came at the culmination the peak of classical economics taking these concepts of uh e economics by which industrial capitalism took off and saying this is the logic of industrial capitalism This is the logic that is going to enable it to grow more and more and that means it's going to grow by uh public sector investment and that's socialism It's going to grow by supporting labor and living standards uh providing housing health care education That's socialism and that's what everybody was the word people were using in the 19th century So what we're trying to do in all of the shows that we're doing is uh not only uh describing uh uh the what used to be the vocabulary to discuss this but the whole concept of what used to be socialism which was capitalism the logic of capitalism evolving Uh so and by doing that we can show how what we're doing is rolling back rolling back time way before 1945 that we begin by talking about way back uh before uh 1776 That's what we're talking about Uh and uh the uh a historical perspective uh and a vocabulary perspective makes all of this clear Yeah You know it reminds me of the what I love to teach when I teach these kinds of courses that the labor theory of value which people attribute to Markx Markx got that from Smith and Ricardo It was part of the classical school because they wanted to show everybody that in the end what limits what a society can produce for itself is the capacity to do work How many able-bodied adults do you have that's the limit of what you can do Now you have to allocate them to the different things you want But you want a limit there's your limit You can't do more than you have the brains and muscles aggregated to do And so the value if that's what we're trying to understand in an economy is this core of labor capacity And every object is the embodiment of a share of what you got to work with How much of that labor abstract labor Markx called it that you can get The irony was what Markx took their understanding of the labor foundation for work and an economy and showed that it involved stealing taking from the worker a portion of the value that the worker added when he or she worked paying him a wage le that had less value in it than the value added by the worker when the worker worked And that surplus that's this thing the the the capitalist takes and then has the arrogance of suggesting that it isn't the worker from whom he's taken it It's something intrinsic he contributes That's how you got the crazy ideas of risk Oh the entrepreneur takes risk As if the worker who comes to work for that entrepreneur isn't taking a risk by doing so I mean the absurd effort And what Michael is showing us is here's here's a double historical irony Capitalism terrified by what Markx taught teaching the workers you are the source of that which oppresses you That capitalist what he has you made People just like you and they didn't keep it just like you're not keeping it And that's how he gets it This was so terrifying that they had to get rid of the whole thing They got rid of the baby with the bathwater They had to find another way to explain why things worked the way they were And they came up with a theory that what makes something valuable is not the labor that's in it but the utility There's a good one That that it you derive from it And that means that what we get in the market the price is the value because it shows how much people want it Therefore value versus price a distinction crucial for Smith Ricardo and Marx disappears in the neocclassical war You know the theory which looks abstract and isn't It's there be in theory you fight out the very same struggle that's going on in the street outside where the theorists are having their confab I agree Thank you so much Michael Do you want to add something no no I agree Uh this is what we've been saying Uh it it it it's not the most topical uh discussion to put it in the long historical setting but this is what you need in order to understand what's happening today Yeah Yeah In case in case people are just speaking for myself in case people are wondering it was me for me learning what Markx had to teach changed everything If whatever I say makes sense then please understand you're talking to Markx I'm just an intermediary applying using but the apparatus is buried in the work of that extraordinary fellow and if you haven't spent some time learning it do yourself and all of us a favor and go do it Thank you so much Richard and Michael for being with us today Great pleasure as always Same here
