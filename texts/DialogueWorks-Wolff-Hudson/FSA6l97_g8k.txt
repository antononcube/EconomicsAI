yeah the sound yeah let's get started Michael okay let's start with the conflict right now in the Middle East how do you find it right now what's going on Michael in your opinion in the Middle East wait I'm sorry what's going on in the world in the in the Middle East the conflict right now in the Middle East between Israel Iran middle I think the Middle East is becoming a catalyst for what we've been talking about for the last two times we've got together the world splitting into two halves uh the US NATO West against the rest of the world and I think the United the near East is a kind of demonstration to uh the the global majority that what America and Israel are doing their with their assassination of individuals their regime change uh and the the violence with with which uh the right-wing liid party supported by the right-wing Democrats and the United States are trying to impose uh in the rest of the world and uh the message I think that Eurasia gets is uh what they're doing to the Palestinians uh and what they're doing Europe is doing to the ukrainians they can do it to us unless we really break away I think that they've given a note this gives a note of urgency I think countries have been talking ever since 1955 in Bandung about how do we uh go away and make a uh kind of a world trade and investment regime that is uh not so exploitative but when they see what's happening in Ukraine and the near East I think this gives uh a note of urgency saying uh you know we really have to uh get together and uh get allies to join our system by offering uh every country that joins enough that it will make them worth joining the uh China uh Russia Iran uh SE orbit uh in instead of uh keeping their links to the West all the West has to offer is bribery and the threat of uh a threat of violence Richard yeah I would like to pick up on what Michael says and the thing that has really impressed itself on me is the signs of the rise of China the rise of the bricks the rise of so much of what what we used to call the third world or the underdeveloped world or the newly emerging all those euphemisms that rise is now clear it's obvious the statistics that that that Michael has put forward that I've put forward that I know you've discussed with us and with others uh on your programs uh all attest to that I mean to give you a small example I read this morning that the Uber Corporation and listen to this story that the Uber corporation which earlier this year was in negotiations with Tesla and the reason it was a negotiation with Tesla is they want to provide cheap electric vehicles to about a 100,000 Uber Uber drivers around the world and they you know they explain in the financial press their purpose um it is to introduce the public to make the public more interested in more comfortable with electric vehicles just standard kind of deal then the deal falls apart and this morning they announced they have now made the deal but not with Tesla with the byd corporation which is China's leading producer of electric vehicles okay why because they couldn't reach a deal with Tesla because of whatever it is Elon Musk did or didn't do in his how shall I put it uh ups and downs as a business person and with the west and so on you you can't keep doing this now that you can see basically a western Corporation Uber making a deal advantaging China over against another Western Corporation it's the very competition of the capital s that is driving the transition into the hands of what they call their enemy it's the old joke about you know capitalists competing to see who gets to sell The Hangman's noose to the people who want to hang capitalism you know it's just a strange self destruction that's beginning to take place let me give you a second an example according to the international records the price of a gas of gasoline at the retail gas station in Iran is 10 cents a gallon that's us cents US gallon the average price in France and Germany for the same gallon of gas is over $7 okay that that's an unsustainable difference in the costs of energy that's I mean it may take a longer shorter may go this way that way but you can the competition there is done any any production that requires oil is able to do that in Iran and it can't possibly compete if it cost $7 in France and Germany and it's more than seven in both of them uh to to get a gallon of gasoline for the truck that goes back and forth and for everything else I think what you're seeing now and this is where I would come in to support the last Point Michael was making what strikes me is not all of that which has been going on for a while and is now accelerating as in Uber and byd and so forth but that the West has chosen as its way of dealing with this not sitting down working out a deal while you're still strong while you're dollar while weaker is still the number one currency in the world and so on no they're not doing that they've decided they're going to somehow either stop or reverse or slow this very process which they cannot do there's no historical precedent to see such a thing they're not going to be able to do it and they frustration and their failure is driving them to levels of violence that are stunning now my last example to try to drive this home the violence in the Middle East Michael is absolutely right it's it's off the chart there was a debate in Israel over the last few days about the legitimacy of sodomizing Palestinian prisoners in jail there's a debate pro and con with lots of pro you know what what has happened to the Israeli people that they are at this point it's like questions that used to be asked of the German people in regard to the victims of the Holocaust it was rightly asked of the Germans it's rightly asked now of the Israelis and Michael is also right that the horror visited upon the Ukrainian people is really extraordinary and if you know the history and I don't mean to absolve Mr PU and the Russians they invaded they violated a border I understand that's a serious problem but we all know what what NATO did at the end after 1989 we all do and nobody who pays any attention and isn't lost in the propaganda War would not understand that this was a crisis being built by the plans of NATO on the one hand and the refusal of Russia on the other the Russians said so enough times it's their Red Line it's there you can't do this you can't do this and then you had those meetings in February and again a little bit later in Istanbul and so on nothing came of it it could have been avoided the misery of of Ukraine it will take them decades to crawl out of the disaster they're in no matter who wins or loses in this this level of violence shows you how desperate the people in in the west now are what they are willing to do what they are willing to preside over others doing they're not ready yet and the issue isn't when do you sit down with the Russians everybody knows eventually there'll be a a meeting and they will work something out that's how every other War like this ends that's how this one will end and everybody knows that who pays any attention and the Israelis are going to have to come to terms with the Palestinians unless they literally mean to exterminate them which they can't do anyway so this what you're watching is a sign of such a level of of desperation that the only thing more B is watching leaders like Mr Biden or for that matter Mr Trump talk as if they had the power maybe the US had in the 1960s and 70s but that's all gone but they seem to think that the political necessity is to humor the American people in the naive imagination that they still are where they were and I notice when I give this simple statistic which I've given you too on this on our discussions that the the uh aggregate GDP of G7 is now significantly less than the aggregate GDP of the bricks no but there it is and I notice that when I explain that to my audience they look at me with a kind of sad eye like I had just uttered something about their intimate life that they had really hoped to keep secret and there I am releasing this unpleasant reality and they won't and they won't remember it 10 minutes from now because it's so unpleasant and now it's going with this level of violence you really have a sense which I pick up in our culture everywhere that we are at some very scary inflection point in American history and no one knows quite what or where it's going but a sense of ominousness I see it I feel it I hear about it everywhere I want to pick up on the point that Richard just made about uh desperation and frustration we know what the US has been doing for frustration it's been imposing sanctions uh on r on China and Russia the interesting thing about this is almost every sanction they have opposed has backfired uh the effect of sanctions uh on something that is necessary for another country is you force that country to produce these Goods itself uh We've Spoken on this program before about how the US started with a agricultural food sanctions against Russia so uh uh uh Russia could no longer import dairy products and food from the Baltic states what happened Russia simply shifted the production to itself now it's independent and once you're become independent uh of something and realize well we never want countries to uh try to interrupt our supply change Again by sanctions uh you lose that market forever so what the United States is doing in its desperation to try to stop the independence of the global majority the 85% from the NATO West is they they're forcing these countries to become independent so that they no longer need the US everything they're doing trying to stop it has the exact opposite effect and that's because the Western mentality is uh to bully to think if you don't uh do what we want we're going to hurt you and they think that sanctions are going to hurt without thinking what are the other countries going to do in response uh they're not thinking of that and uh if they thinking well we're going to uh kill the chickens to front frighten the monkeys by what they're doing uh in Ukraine and in Palestine uh that is uh likewise driving other countries to uh accelerate the fact that we'd better move quickly uh in this year's brics meeting under Russia and next year's brics conferences under China's leadership we'd better be able to make deals with all of our Eurasian neighbors uh that we will help us create a critical mass so that we no longer have to depend on the NATO West and uh this uh what can the NATO West do it can only accelerate its violence uh and the more it accelerates it the more it will Speed The Parting guests all all they want to do is to be left alone and uh the United States is trying to prevent them by uh from this by for ing them to make the choice between either they go it alone or they're going to end up looking like Germany uh and other us protectorates let me pick up I mean if I can on on Michael back you know doing this back and forth Michael Michael's Insight interestingly and unusually gets an enormous support from an article if you have not encountered it let me urge you and everyone listening and watching on the 25th of July that's a few days ago um The Washington Post carried an absolutely extraordinary article it was about how the last four presidents of the United States initiated and organized a massive acceleration of what it calls economic Warfare but what it really means is sanctions and it says so and and it it it it makes it crystal clear that the United States is the sanction Master it mentions Biden and Trump and Obama and Bush now of course sanctions go way back I mean one example in the article is Cuba we we sanctioned Cuba for over half a century the whole point and purpose was to get rid of Fidel Castro what a failure that was and then he here's two things that sort of expand on Michael's point this article everything I'm telling you comes from that article the 25th of July Washington Post cannot miss it first statistic the United States currently has outstanding 15,000 sanctioned objects individuals corporations whole countries 15,000 and in that position the United States ranks number one says the Washington Post and the number two is less is around 5,000 so about onethird of what the United States is the number two and you might be surprised the number two country imposing sanctions in the world is Switzerland right in other words it's the United States Russia and China don't appear here on the list in the Washington Post they don't do this all right so you ask yourself you know a question a five-year-old would figure out if one side in the so-called great struggle namely the West the United States is imposing sanctions everywhere and the other side in this great struggle is imposing sanctions nowhere What might explain this odd you know they have drones we have drones they have missiles we have missiles they have they have sanctions we don't we have sanctions they don't well the answer is Michael's point which I want to bring out when you sanction a country the leadership in that country the people who run the society are almost always immune they're not going to change their clothes they're not eat a different diet they're not going to stop driving their car the pain that sanctions can and do impose is on the mass of people who suffer you know poverty or not Cuba didn't have access to Medical you know drugs and medicines and so forth well then of course what does every leader of a sanctioned Society do make crystal clear as your number number one priority that it's not your fault as the leader of that country it's not your political party's fault it's the fault of the United States sanctions are a way of mobilizing global public opinion against the United States as the great sanction of our time this is a program in which you line up the Howitzer so it is aimed directly into your own feet this is nuts as a policy forget all the other horrors of it and the real suffering it causes it is a self-defeating program and a sure sign that the people who pursue it may get a temporary advantage in the local political theater Maybe but they are paying an unbelievable price in the society's future it's and it's very survivability in a world where it is becoming more and more isolated every day I want to put a sense of perspective on what Richard just said uh he's talked about the fact that the sanctions are uh mobilizing other countries to support themselves but there's been a a backwash effect a major effect itive sanctions especially against China have been on the United States itself The Producers now Richard and I both believe in the materialist approach of history and most of our approach has always been well pretty much what countries do reflects the interest of their business Community or the financial Community or the elites but let's look at what's happened in America with the sanctions that they've put on against selling computer chips and information technology to China uh Intel and other country have said if they oby obey the sanctions that the Biden Administration has put on and especially if they uh follow the sanctions that Trump is going to put on there goes their uh their profits the profits of the business community in the United States have largely been exporting to these countries that are and are that are now subject to the ins sanctions that the American government itself has been putting on now how do you reconcile the fact that the American sanctions that are imposed by the neoliberal the neocons and the neoliberals are a against the profit uh search by the leading American uh sectors Information Technology sectors uh the you could go right to the car manufacturers all the others you could say that the the the sanctions end up penalizing the US economy much more than other countries because while other countries have a short-term Interruption of their supply they have long-term Independence and for America this uh long-term effect and even the short-term effect is to uh take away from the American exporters uh the the leading industrial sectors certainly on the stock exchange to take away this Market it's lost so what the Americans are doing is isol self ol ating themselves uh we all thought for years that somehow the global majority was going to uh get together and draft a means of becoming independent and helping their own economic interests but it's the United States that is driving this uh ironically not uh China not Russia uh not these other countries they're reacting uh to the US that is uh essentially committing policies that are economically suicidal yeah well I've noticed that too if you read for example the the statements periodically put out by the United States Chamber of Commerce you get what Michael is talking about they're very ner they don't want this fighting with China they they represent large number of Corporations who have put large amounts of investment inside China they don't want to lose those uh China is the biggest fastest growing Market in the world nobody wants to be excluded every business school teaches you want to make a lot of money you go to where the wages are cheap and the market is growing hello that's these other parts of the world that's where all that is going on and and that's going to outcompete the West sooner or later they say all of that so Michael's question stands what's going on and here's the best that I can do I'm guessing and I'm hoping you or your audience sets me if I'm making a mistake they really don't see what we're talking about in other words when I said earlier a bit mockingly they they live in the 1960s and 70s when the dominance of the United States was real maybe there's more truth to that than my mockery would leave anyone to understand that they really do believe that this is a temporary momentary challenge which they are capable willing and able to squash and that they go to these companies and say yes yes we understand you know this kind of tariff is bad for you this way that way and the next way however bear with us because we are really going to succeed and when we do it's just around the corner we will defeat them and then we will carve up Russia which will become 20 little countries like the rest of Eastern Europe easily manipulable by all of us and when we're done with Russia we'll do the same with China and then wow will we have a world because we will have integrated Russia and China into our subordination Arrangement it's the dream of colonialism and imperialism for a long long time it's a unified World economy under the west and and for them who are brought up in this believe in this had that special time after World War II it's not so surprising that they think that they that project is still achievable it's a little harder than maybe they thought but that's what they're going to do that's what they're going to do and and we are all here you know wasting our time Michael you me and all the others like us because we don't see the larger picture and that's what they tell the corporate Executives yeah you'll have a year or two or three but whoa when we're done will'll you be happy and by the way while we're waiting we'll make it easier for you you ship people you're losing your Market will give you a subsidy to likes of which you had never dreamed of will give you this break and that in other words we'll give you supports for your profits the way we do when there's an economic downturn or when there's a pandemic or anything El this is a this is an adjustment process I watch the speeches of my fellow graduate student Janet Yellen we went to Yale at the same time we had the same teachers we got the same PhD we read the same articles all from people that Michael knows all too well you know our teacher from macro was James Tobin and our teacher for international was triffin and on and on and on she knows and yet she is an enthusiastic manager for this difficult time as we reorganize the world for the next great phase of capital accumulation Michael do you want to add something okay let's go with the conflict with with the situation in Venezuela and how did you find it in the United States they try to do everything to interfere the situation in Venezuela even Elon Musk just he was putting out right and left in order to help the position in the in Venezuela yeah could I say something because for me there is a humor here and I do try in these dark times to find some humor the same people who here in the United States respond to Donald Trump when he questions the election when he denies is the outcome he is thereby threatening democracy the people in Venezuela who Challenge and threaten the election and deny the outcome are upholding democracy this is you need a magician to appreciate this kind of Switcheroo right the election here in our country presumably we know them all about the election thousands of miles away in a different country with a different culture and a different language we could all be excused for not knowing exactly what's going no no no we know it's a threat to democracy when you question what happens here and it's an upholding of democracy when you reject an election there it it and the comfort and the ease with which this is said you know when no one notes the irony I've just told you when no one catches that it's very obvious if no one catches it you know how desperate the ideological nonsense must be because it's uding the brains and the vision of people who obviously could and should know better what Richard uh mentioned before about sanctions reinforcing the uh voters support of the government because uh uh realize that the the problems the economy is facing are caused by the United States uh Venezuela provides an object lesson uh the problem that is caused for Venezuela is really because uh one of the dictators that America imposed on that country before I don't remember if it was Perez or someone else they uh they uh did two things they collateralized their foreign Dollar borrowings by the Venezuelan oil industry including uh the oil indust the oil industry had uh reached out and used its profits to bu uh the American uh distribution network uh for uh sale of uh it its oil and and gas well the the Americans first of all grabbed all of Venezuela's Holdings in the United States in other words it grabbed its International uh uh reserves that's you could say what is now called uh a national uh uh savings fund uh and secondly uh the United States directed Britain to grab Venezuela's gold Supply and uh give it to uh a president that the United States uh described the United States says look we have two models of democracy for the world Ukraine and Israel uh those are the two democracies uh and Venezuela we want to add it to it uh we get to uh nominate who's going to be head of the democracies or to pull a regime change uh opposition so uh the the Venezuelan uh dollar foreign agreements all have a clause just like Argentina had if there's a dispute it's held in the US courts uh other countries are looking at Venezuela and they're think thinking no matter what uh we will never have uh any International Clause that is settled by the United States courts in fact we need a bricks Court we need an alternative Court to uh the IMF the World Bank and uh uh the international court and it'll be a bricks Court among ourselves and instead of the rules B based order it'll be the real uh rule of law so you're having that function and uh it's also I think showing that if um a country like Venezuela is U the uh object of sanctions such as the African countries and the Latin American countries uh the the uh the global South dter countries are sanctioned that is an action by the dollar block to prevent them from earning the money to pay their foreign dollar debts this becomes a legal logical and moral uh excuse for repudiating the debts that is really what uh is going to be the ultimate break the dollarization break is what's going to be uh the sign of this uh Global fracture in between the global majority and uh the NATO Us West I I can't I can't miss the opportunity and again I hope folks enjoy the irony many of the world's religions I'm no expert so I can't say all of but many of the world's religions have in them a proposition very close to what Michael just said in the Christian religion it's called The Jubilee it's a very old idea been around for thousands of years that when a society begins to become so bitterly divided that the glue holding the community together dissolves and the the the life of the community is threatened by inequality in the old days by having a large piece of land when your fellow citizens had no land at all etc etc what was periodically done was that all debts were erased all debts were erased and you kind of start over if it was land then the land was taken away from whoever had it and redivide it perhaps using know random system of you get this piece and you get that piece and the other one gets the other piece and then we see how that goes and if it produces too great inequality well then in 10 years or 20 years we're going to do it again and it was a way of holding on to what to what in modern language would be the way the United States used to enjoy describing itself as a vast middle class you know nobody very rich nobody very poor everybody in the middle well Jubilee was aimed at doing that what Michael is telling us is that Jubilee can also be not a voluntarily religiously sanctioned regular activity but Jubilee can be the explosive end when there's no other alternative to resolve the absurdity of a system that concentrates vast amounts of wealth in the hands of the Creditor and desperate life in the hands of the debtor at that point the overwhelming majority who are debtors will see in the Jubilee a very happy outcome and that the creditors will be unable to stop it they won't have the resources and at that point it's over it's not a question of Courts anymore and it's just a recognition that the social contract requires the end of this inequality and debt forgiveness is a a simple direct stroke to get to deal with most of it what Richard has described is really the distinction between Eurasian civilization and Western Civilization uh my book uh on uh forgiven their debts and all of the books that I've done with my Harvard group when the ancient near East shows that from uh 2500 BC in Sumer down through uh Babylonia to their near Eastern neighbors uh all societies all the way to Judea uh cancel The Debs regularly uh because they all had a king or they call the textbooks called them Divine kingship meaning a king that had certain uh Promises to the god to maintain uh stability and to uh the rest all the rest of the world has a an economic view that is the opposite of what Americans are taught in school uh we have the Babylonian mathematical models that they had in 1800 BC they are more sophisticated than any model used by the National Bureau of economic research here the Babylonians saw that every society the natural effect of debt is to polarize Society between creditors and debtors and uh the they were very aware that if you do not uh cancel the debts then you're going to have a financial oligarchy emerge and the role of the uh ruler the whether it's hamar Robi or other near Eastern rulers was to prevent an oligarchy Financial oligarchy from uh developing because as the biblical prophets Isaiah and the others all pointed out uh the oligarchy is going to use its Financial power to get the population in debt to take over its land and you'll end up with a few people owning all of the land and who set plot to plot and house to house until there's no room for the pop free population in the land anymore well uh the W A Classical Greece and Italy were the first uh uh countries in the west to um to sort of found Western Civilization they didn't have Divine rulers they had and they didn't cancel debts they had a financial oligarchy that's what we all know what happened to Rome over a period of 500 years there were revolutions and you ended up with the collapse of you ended up with serfdom and the feudalism well um The Well the West Was going uh sort of Roman Christian uh not the U uh classic the Orthodox Christianity in Constantinople you had Islam and Islam normally uh would when there was a crop failure they would cancel anull all of the deaths so for instance this is what happened in India uh for uh hundreds of years under Islam and uh until the English came over and that when the English uh took over the uh India they stopped the whole idea of debt cancellation and you had an economic polarization that has gone down to India today making it one of the most uh uh unequal countries in the world so you could say the defining characteristic of Western Civilization is from the beginning to let a financial oligarchy develop and all of the rest of the nonwestern world from uh the Babylonian Sumer through uh Iran through uh Islam U all the way uh for even in Japan you had it in China you had it uh this used to be the distinguishing feature between uh Eurasian and western civilization and uh uh I would uh expect that uh the uh the bricks groups that are negotiating dollarization are going to reinvent the wheel uh and uh reinvent the same uh idea of uh you no country should put paying a creditor class to create an oligarchy above the idea of social balance that is enabling the entire economy to grow and become more productive uh and survive in order to survive and avoid falling into a Dark Age and surf them uh you have to have a higher authority than uh the uh the oligarchy who is going to uh cancel the debts and uh the western civilization doesn't have a higher authority we have an uh as Aristotle said many countries constitutions call themselves democracy they're really oligarchies every Western Civilization uh economy for the last 2,000 years has been an oligarchy uh Asia uh has an entirely different historical uh background and just as uh President Putin in Russia is pushing uh to say look Russia has a distinct civilizational uh characteristic I'm waiting for China and other uh Asian countries and for uh the Islamic countries to say yes we have a background too and uh it's not that of Roman Christianity uh it it's uh we're going to put the overall interests before the class interest of of a financial class I'm sort of waiting for that to be a distinguishing fact feature of what we're really seeing as a civilizational break if I could let me let me translate that into very recent American history the wisdom of it extends very very far up until around the 1970s roughly you could see the productivity of the United States Rising slowly and steadily and the wages Rising slowly and steadily more or less you know right and no one should be mystified by this productivity is what the worker gives the the employer and a wage is what the employer gives the worker and they were going up nicely together the employers were making more profits the workers were making higher wages it went on for a long time and gave the United States its remarkable growth helped to develop the idea every generation lives better than the one before and all of that then in the 197 these for a whole host of reasons the real wages flatten out they don't go up anymore the productivity keeps going up well in English simple that means what workers give employers kept going up and up and up but what employers gave workers didn't and that's why we've had a profit Boom for the last 40 or 50 years and the stock market boom but now comes the the other side of the coin if if you Hammer the working class with the American dream this is what makes you a successful worker you must have a car and a home you must send your kid to college you must have a vacation for several we if you're demanding of of the self-esteem of people wrapped up but you're not giving them the rising wage to to afford it what are you going to do you're going to throw them into debt because that's the only way they can have the American dream by borrowing and going into the debt de disaster and here's the double irony where are the lenders coming from the lenders are the are the employers because their profits have been rising since productivity Rises and wages don't so they have the growing productivity uh to lend to the workers CU for them it's a no-brainer would I rather give my worker a rising wage or a flat wage and a and a loan which he has to pay back well that's easy we we know what we're going to do so that's what we have and over the last 40 years we have plunged the American people into a level of debt that nobody else has ever seen Mortgage Debt student debt credit card debt I mean Auto debt you add it all up and we're talking more and more families have a bigger debt than they have an annual income this is impossible meanwhile the wealth at the top is a wealth not only of getting the Surplus out of the worker in production but getting the interest payment when you've lent them the money instead of paying them a wage I mean this is a system guaranteed to produce grotesque inequality and that's exactly the story that Michael has been telling you whether you go back to ancient or you're right here in the United States in the last 50 years what you're watching are different systems but they have in common that unless you do something fundamental about them they will produce an inequality deepening and getting worse and worse Thomas petti a few years ago documents it for capitalism in his book and then it blows up and then the question is are we at the blowup Point are we getting near the blowup point and my suspicion is to go back to how we began that the level of violence that you see in Ukraine in Palestine is a sign of really desperate uh holding on to something who's rationale as long gone well what Richard has described is a how much uh capitalism has been transformed uh he he just mentioned uh how in industrial capitalism made America rich and they realized that highly paid well-fed well educated well-clothed labor was more productive uh for its employers than popper Labor uh and this was uh essentially what the whole economic philosophy of industrial capitalism was well then uh we learned from Marx that what distinguishes industrial capitalism is the employers uh will uh hire labor and they will then sell the products that labor produces uh at a profit over and above uh what they have to pay uh for the cost of Labor what we but now look at what Richard's described uh and what I've described uh in uh in debt that most that uh the American wage earners I don't want to call them a middle class because it really wasn't a middle class they're wage earners uh and the uh major uh exploitation of them is not is no longer primarily just uh by uh having industrial uh employers uh keep the profits on what the wage earners uh imply create because after all we're de-industrializing the major exploitation uh is that is occurring is large in Debt Service uh the wealthiest uh 1% maybe you could say 10% of the population hold the 90% majority uh in debt and uh the income that's paid to the uh topper uh 10% is uh sucked out of the 90% in the form of debt service and even more important what do these 10% do with the money they don't spend all of this interest uh economic rent interest and financial gains on goods and services they buy stocks and bonds uh and real estate or they lend yet more money to uh families to buy real estate or to corporate ratings to take over companies and so uh what you have is the uh economic Elite not making their money by employing labor to uh make profits and uh save get wealthy out of saving the profits uh but by Financial engineering by capital gains uh and Richard just pointed out the immense rise in the stock market bond market real estate market uh you you have uh a whole focus on asset price inflation on on uh ownership rights and creditor rights uh to turn the rest of the economy into a citizenry of debtors and renters uh instead well that's just what happened under feudalism basically somehow uh the uh the industrial uh revolution of Europe and the United States uh had this idea that they were going to evolve into something very close to socialism and every we talked before about everybody in the 19th century uh was in favor of socialism of one kind or another many different kinds of socialism but all of that changed after World War I and uh the the landlords and the bankers and the monopolists fought back uh and uh they fought against government regulation they said there's no such thing as unearned income no such thing as as economic rent everything is earned just like profits the uh the banks earned money by charging interest and even more than interest the penalty fees for late fees uh all of that is earned income and so you have a whole transformation in the idea of what wealth is all about and what the economy is all about and it's no longer the idea that industrial capitalism had uh two centuries ago uh it's something entirely different it's Finance capitalism or as many that many people now are calling Neo feudalism it's a transformation that's what is uh driving other countries apart because what has made China get rich of course it's socialism but it's also uh socialism uh that is following EX exactly the same pattern that made America Germany and France get rich in the in the 19th century it's industrial capitalism and socialism together because uh the industrialists uh wanted an active uh public sector they wanted active public infrastructure in order to keep the cost of living and doing business low to subsidize uh their production all of this subsidy has now been broken up uh by the uh the fight against government uh by libertarianism and if you uh disable government uh action government regulation and government uh capital investment you you have uh since every economy is planned the planning shifts to Wall Street and today you have Wall Street capitalism not industrial capitalism that's the real transformation that is uh on the deepest level separating the NATO West now from I think what we're seeing evolve in Eurasia and precisely because if I may not uh precisely because of this concentration of wealth you have the reaction which concentrated wealth has always exhibited the people at the top that are gathering all this wealth through production and then when that Fades through financial manipulation and reorganization they realize as they become richer and richer relative to the mass of the population that their wealth is at stake that they are in a vulnerable position they probably can't get over the irony they've done everything to become rich and powerful and feel less secure in that position than they ever have and in a society which values as we still do universal suffrage or something close to it that puts you in a in genuine ly vulnerable position the number of employers is very small and the number of employees is very large a universal suffrage you know where that can go the workers could at any time vote to undo the inequality created by the capitalist economy you can get them to you can hear it when when there's discussion however repressed of progressive taxation when you hear the complaints G we tax capital gains at a lower rate than we tax labor income and so forth and so on so what have they done they've done the one thing that obviously they had to do they have to neutralize the political system which they do by buying it why buying it because that's the one resource they have and the and the politicians can be made to need money that was easy and now you lend them the money or you give them the money and they give you back even more privileges than you had before so the the the industrial military have their Monopoly and the medical people have their Monopoly now the the chip makers are quickly working to get their Monopoly organized so it becomes then the old again feudal joke of a handful of monopolists being able to sit on top by the requisite politicians have the politicians develop the verbiage to make all of this seem natural normal uh having to do with technology anything other than the real question of how have you organized the workplace and and when people say well why is it going in this Direction let me you know let me be a teacher for a moment the capitalist system organizes in the way the feudal system did and the slave system did in a very odd way it takes a very small group of people and puts them in a very high position the Masters the Lords and the employers that's why we've been so disappointed that the revolution to get rid of slavery did it it achieved it but it it it welcomed in feudalism which while being better than slavery didn't make people Pro objects like cattle nonetheless it had the Lord and the surf and then we had the French and American Revolutions with all their Great Hopes for Liberty equality fraternity and all the rest but what we did was we built capitalism which has the employer and the employee which is a replication of the tiny group at the top so why are we surprised that our financial system and indeed our political system replicates a small group of people who make the decision we all know that a small group makes the decisions everywhere we bemoon it we criticize it but it's built built into the way capitalism organizes at the base in every Factory office and store that's how it's done it's only the odd exception of a group of people who have a worker Coop or some other kind of and those are people who don't want the capitalism but yet can often not even say those words because of the way our ideology and our education system works but if if anything that Michael and I have been saying has validity then it is grounded in an economic system that imposes that odd totally undemocratic Arrangement as if it were the normal necessary I'm reminded that before we got rid of Kings we lived in societies where most people thought it was absolutely appropriate that the grandson of somebody who's long dead should be ruling over me because he or she discusses with God every third day if it doesn't rain how to run everything you know what we got rid of the Kings and discover we didn't need them guess what you can get rid of the CEO and you will discover we never needed them but that's too much at this point in American development and in much of the world we still have to push to open this space to even think such thoughts let alone rationally EV evaluate alternative systems so what keeps all this going is the illusion as Margaret Thatcher said there is no alternative now uh Richard and I and in fact all of the guests you've been having Nema on your show uh have been have a common denominator we're all saying there is an alternative uh and uh that's why uh the guests you have on your show are not uh featured in The New York Times And The Washington Post and uh were're not on the uh television talk shows uh we're saying there is an alternative and that's the that is the nightmare uh the horror that uh the uh the ruling class in the west has and it's that nightmare that gets back to what uh Richard said uh earlier the Panic at the thought that uh the bricks uh can actually have a different economic system uh that is on a completely different basis of uh Mutual gain and uh economic growth and uh it's not there you can't call this a theid trap uh China Russia and the bricks are not trying to outcompete the United States and England and Europe at their own game they don't want to play that game uh it's a they're saying we're not going to go down that road we're not competing with you we want you to go your way we'll go our way we're creating an alternative civilization it doesn't have to be that this way that's their alternative to Tina and that's what I guess all the guests on your shows have been talking about for quite a while now and they've been meeting the resistance all you I agree with Michael but you they meet the resistance that it is very difficult for the people in charge who have been in charge for the last century or more uh to admit that that that this could exist they the irony they are convinced that Russia and China want to dominate them in what psychologists call Pure projection it's it it's European colonialism and imperialism that looks upon anybody else's emergence as a challenge because they can't imagine anybody not wanting to do to them what they know somewhere they've been doing to the rest of the world and I think you can you can see it I think you're seeing it in Ukraine and and Israel and in Palestine and you're seeing there the capability of people who have otherwise been civilized in all kinds of ways descending into levels of behavior that we had hoped to the middle of the 20th century would make us never do again as in the slogan never again and yet that here it is with only the roles reversed rather than the problem solved just to wrap up this session Michael and Richard there is an article in Economist it says that China is building up huge secret reservers of food raw materials and energy resources in preparation for possible future problems do you think that China is preparing for a big war with the west or they're talking this way because they want to picture this in the mind of westerners well I I must tell you if I I I can't speak for obviously for the Chinese and I don't understand their motivation uh in this situation I I I have no inside information but I would tell you this if I were a Chinese citizen and if I were involved in in in these discussions I would say to myself given the sanctions of the United States from Mr Trump's tariff Wars and trade Wars on through Mr Biden's continuation of most of them given the absurdity of the whole Taiwan nonsense given the presence of the fleet in the South China Sea you have to make make preparations otherwise you are an incompetent leader you have to prep you have to protect yourself might they have aggressive intentions I'm not aware of those but you I don't know I'm not claiming to know but but you don't need an aggressive intention to justify what you just said the United States and that goes back to something Michael said the United States is giving not just China the reason to do it but here's more important the whole rest of the world reasons the way I just did The Observers the other countries they look at the news you just gave that they are storing food and whatever all right and they ask themselves is that for aggressive and they're going to come up with the same answer I am they can certainly see in everyday's headline what's going on in every session of the UN in every debate over whether it's Ukraine or or anybody else the United States is busily sanctioning 15,000 sanctions to try to get the world to behave the way it wants that's what the sanctions are for nobody else has the sheer audacity to think like that and what the United States is discovering with great rage is that it can think it all at once it just can't do it the sanctions as the article in the Washington Post admits do not work and as Michael added worse than that they don't work they make matters for the US worse so again that's a sign of a society in very deep trouble well uh as Richard and I say we don't believe in getting information from the New York Times And The Washington Post but there's one thing you do get uh and if you're a Chinese uh it's the only thing worth reading about in the times and the post and that day after day China is our enemy uh uh the uh American uh diplomats go to China and say we don't want you to give any uh support for Russia because uh if you give them food that can feed soldiers if you give them cloth they can weave that into govern into uh uniforms uh you you can't help Russia uh because we want Russia to lose so then we can fight you and do to you what we did to Russia and Ukraine and do to you what Israel's done to the Palestinians well uh they they read this every day they they they can read the American speeches I don't believe that the Americans read uh the speeches of President Putin or uh Secretary of State lavro uh and uh the the Chinese are not quite as explicit uh as the the Russians are uh but uh they can read the US press and they think the whole US economy uh is uh aimed uh if not at War at least for uh making uh High profits for the military industrial complex even if their weapons don't work at least uh they're they're huge Cost Plus profits under Pentagon capitalism yet another form of capitalism we haven't talked about uh and and so yes uh they're preparing to go at alone I don't think they're necessarily stockpiling uh these uh raw materials such as rare Earths and uh uh so many other product helium other products they're having uh for themselves because but for the they're trying to use the possession of these to talk to the other Eurasian neighbors that they have and saying look we can uh we can help you uh become independent and part of a growing civilization in Eurasia we we have the material to support you uh you don't need to depend on what the United States England and Germany uh can give you anymore uh there there I think they have a region-wide uh uh idea uh not simply uh military defense but an economic alternative their their defense is going to be we don't want to go to war we want an economic uh uh alternative and maybe someday in a generation or two the West will think gee Eurasia is going ahead and we're not maybe we should adopt Eurasian civilization and realize that Western Civilization has not been uh as successful as we uh we've been taught you know it's not that many years ago that Europeans gathered themselves together and got some support from governments and sent expeditions to China and discovered that they knew how to do textiles better than Europeans that their diet was much better than you know it this not the first time I mean there's a level of self delusion on the west that is yet another part of a declining situation when you can't open yourself even to your own history thank you so much for being with us today Richard and Michael great pleasure as always yes and it's becoming a very interesting at least for me a very interesting Trio that we are accomplishing here yeah yeah I love it thank you so much see you soon
