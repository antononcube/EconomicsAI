we had P putting out some preconditions for the conflict in Ukraine he was talking about just some regions that are already in the hand of Russians and he was talking about that Ukraine cannot be part of NATO and the positive thing was that he he was willing to negotiate on the basis of what has been what they've been negotiating with Ukraine in Istanbul that was so important and the tricky part was he said that as time goes by these conditions would change and we right after that we had this Summit in Switzerland just giving you some highlights from this Summit that was so amazing to me that the the president of Finland he was complaining that Russia had invaded his country during the second world war and taking 10% of its territory and he didn't mention that they were fighting they they were H's Ally they were fighting in favor of Nazis and he didn't mentioned that right after that Russia just returned all the territory captured during those days and the other thing that dud that he was he's just asking just to breaking up Russia in 200 smaller ethnic states that this is huge when you look at this type of mindset he's calling decolonizing Russia dividing Russia in federations in small states it seems to me it's the same kind of policy in Taiwan they're talking about we we we we want to decolonize Taiwan from China it's unbelievable how do you see the situation of these peace talks that you see nothing about peace but everything about war yeah I think that the the answer to all of these questions uh has to do with um a changing World economy I think I'm going to try to show you in a moment why what the fins are doing and the polls are doing and uh the West Collective West is doing is and I I choose my words carefully A desperate and I mean it desperate gesture a politics of symbolism because they cannot change what's happening it must put yourself for a moment in the mentality of blinkin or Jake Sullivan or the people that that are making the decisions and Mr Biden is no longer relevant um they inherited or spent their entire lives before taking on their current positions growing up in the United States Allied first and foremost with Europe the old colonial power of the world Europe Britain France Germany Italy and a few Netherlands but you know Europe and the United States the new Empire the old Empire Britain and everything around that um you know let's remember they carved up Africa they carved up much of Asia they were you know they were the dominant everything and they had only one enemy and that was Russia the Soviet Union after 1917 okay that was their whole life and in the second half of the 20th century they really became dominant they worried about the Soviet Union but never as a political challenge never as an economic challenge a little bit as a military challenge but it was contained by the way that was the policy containment starting with George Kennan and and for most of the second half of the 20th century they had it under control us dominance grew us power grew even the revolution in China didn't seem to change it very much okay toward the end there were some troublesome developments most important the war in Vietnam which the United States lost defeated this was a shock even Korea could be seen as a of stalemate but not Vietnam no stalemate you were defeated and and this worried them and they went to work and built up their military even more and then they thought they were in a new world of even greater dominance because of the collapse of the Soviet Union their enemy and now they come 30 years 20 years after the collapse of the Soviet Union and instead of them being on top of the world in total control beyond what they had been prepared for it was was the opposite their dominance was disappearing and the irony which they could never face because of their ideological blinders the irony is they themselves were major contributors to what happened to them when the capitalist class of the United States western Europe and Japan saw a profit opportunity in China they went they made the deal they said we want from you in China cheap labor and a growing market and the Chinese said we give you that we give you cheap labor and we give you access to our Market it is the biggest fastest growing Market in the world and no capitalist could resist this they all went for the cheap labor the growing market and they gave the Chinese investment money and they signed contracts to Share technology nobody forced them to do any of this nobody had to steal anything from them they were willing to sell it they did sell it and the Chinese having figured out that the fastest way to grow a modern economy is not to be either all private like Britain and and United States nor to be all government the Soviet Union but to be a well-managed by a Communist Party a well-managed combination 5050 half private half public powerful government controlled by a CLE focused party okay that's their system you may not like it you may like it I really don't care but what we have to understand is they are the most successful economic growth story period in history nobody comes close even the Soviet Union which went very far cannot compare with what the Chinese have accomplished and they are now now doing what a successful economic growth story enables a country to do just as was discovered by Britain when its early capitalism gave them a global Empire when the United States with a more robust capitalism gave them a global Empire uh we are watching the Chinese they may do a different story it's not yet clear they don't have an Empire yet but they may go there but what's clear and here's the key point is that the West is declining it cannot maintain its Global position the United States is still a rich and powerful country no question but it isn't what it was and it becomes less so every week every week there's another statistic if you're looking you can see it so they keep trying to do something to stop this they can't and what you what you see in lucer Switzerland with the peace conference or what you watch Putin explaining slowly to them are all the adjustments around the world to a new global economy so for example everybody who isn't stupid can see that China and Russia understand their common interests at this point Russia wants to become again an important player in the world and they're doing that China sees the advantage of having a a successful Russia as its Ally Russia has more a more develop military than the Chinese do so they can give the Chinese that and the Chinese can give Russia the market the opportunity this is a mar the French would say marage oier you know a marriage made in heaven um and there's nothing that the the West can't do anything I mean it can choose to fight a nuclear war but then it's over then it doesn't matter anymore and short of that they can't do anything look at the disaster in Ukraine it is a complete farce they are fighting a non-nuclear war and they losing year in and year out they're losing the dismissal of the Swiss conference is a mistake yes it is true it was really only the west and its allies who came there I mean to have a peace conference and not invite one of the Waring parties is ridiculous I mean it's so ridiculous you wonder why would you do that and the answer is given by the conference because you're losing you can't really have a peace conference because what it would show and what this one in Switzerland did show was that if you compare the meeting of the United Nations General Assembly a few weeks after Russia invaded Ukraine 141 countries agreed on a resolution that was passed 141 out of about 195 countries that are represented in the United Nations 141 an overwhelming majority demanded an immediate ceasefire demand Ed an immediate withdrawal of all Russian troops to where they were before the invasion you know on and on and on here we are two and a half years later and they knew they couldn't get anything like that that over the last two and a half years large numbers of countries will not take the side of the West and in that communic at the end of the meeting in Switzerland last week you know how many governments signed the C communic 77 half of the support that they had 141 is gone it's gone these countries their public relations have been so disastrously filled that the Russian arguments that NATO is encroaching on what it promised not to do uh after 1989 that the the ukrainians provoke them that only all those arguments that Putin and the Russians give are now agreed to by by 70 countries who didn't agree to it before you know what that's called that's a failure that's an enormous failure of the West just as important as United States losing the war in Vietnam or losing the war in Afghanistan if you want to come Clos the same thing these are losses these are not stalemates these are not draw this is a failure and the importance of that Swiss conference is that they couldn't do better than a conference which excluded one side in the dis Ute they want to bring peace to that's ridiculous right begin with number two they were still so desperate that they did it and they brought zalinski in to give one of his silly speeches it'll never ever what you the first time it's okay the second time okay he's the leader of the country he rallies it but not not after two and a half years of steady loss you can't you can't do to it becomes you know first time it's tragedy second time it's farce it's a joke but even funnier and even crazier are statements like Duda you know we're going to carve up Russia in the early days of the West's confidence statement we will subject Russia we will defeat Russia Russia will come to its knees the Russian Rubble will collapse all of that none of it happened but they were and there were statements by Americans including defense secretary Austin breaking up Russia that phrase was used splitting up Russia you had the fantasy that has been the the Cold War which is this what's in these people's mind that they're going to dissolve Russia but that's crazy because they know that the problem isn't Russia the problem is the Russian Chinese Alliance and if you understand that then you can see that the Chinese are not going to permit you to destroy their most important Ally they're not going to let you do it unless you're prepared to use nuclear weapons but then you know then it's over and we don't have it anymore so what you're getting from the Polish is an even more desperate gesture language all these words because they can't do anything and the situation gets worse every day bricks is getting larger the role of the dollar in the world is diminishing the important Ally of the United States perhaps the most important economically Saudi Arabia and the oil business is now lost the Sodis you know they they were not they didn't sign that commun they're not participating they're making their new deals with the new dominance in the world they're and every country is doing it the little poor country of Ni ner in Africa you know throws the Americans out and brings the Russians in what what so now they're scrambling to do that they're desperate and that's what you're wa you're watching a desperate politics of gesture of theater of you know oh massive this and talking Janet Yellen you know my classmate from economics school you know goes to China and tells them you should have a system more like ours you should change your system she who's losing is explaining to China whose system has outperformed the United States for 30 years her good advice you should change your system to be like ours that is so crazy that you can imagine after she leaves the Chinese leadership gets together at a local restaurant and they can't eat because they're laughing they don't know what to do with such a display is the woman crazy doeses she not live in the same planet we do what we should take the advice of the loser about how we should change the strategy that has gotten us to the point where this is her third visit in a year to talk to us she doesn't go anywhere else she didn't go to Britain three times she went to China why why the reason she goes to China renders what she says in China ridiculous you know Americans are no more crazy than anybody else we are just I'm an America we are just as smart and but we are behaving in a way that ought to make an intelligent person say why is this interesting country with its Rich history with many accomplishments that it can be proud what what's happening here and then when you see that we're choosing between Biden and Trump you get more evidence something is terribly wrong here and you if you if you think that then I think you've understood that you're going to be seeing mostly theater whether Biden wins or Trump wins it's mostly theater they're putting on a theater and and they don't understand their audience they think Their audience is the United States but most most of the people in United States don't pay attention it's the rest of the world which looks on the United States as if they're crazy but you have to be careful because it's a dangerous crazy United States still has nuclear weapons and still has people who seriously consider using them so you you you know it I can make fun and I'm doing that but I'm also respectful that the United States can do a lot of damage in the world it has the potential to do a lot of good but it it's so afraid you know you have to remember for those of you that are not Americans try to understand the the peculiarity of this Society it is now owned and operated by descendants of Europeans what I'm about to say should be understood particularly well in Brazil for example because there similarity here so the Europeans come and they kill all the local people they murder them violent destructive ethnic cleansing uh genocide all apply and it took a century or two in this country us to kill them all with the few that are left stuck on reservations which is a kind of genocide only it goes slowly and so it doesn't offend you so obvious so the country is born in a in its modern form in an unspeakable violence that is everywhere Northeast south west midwest it's everywhere different times but the slaughter of the indigenous population is the history of this country in its first 200 years it be before and after Independence it it's extraordinary and the next major phenomena is having destroyed the indigenous population you took the indigenous people of Africa and brought them here as slaves to do what and that for a huge part of the country and remember slavery existed in newor New York in Ohio all over not just the American South the history of New York City is you if you want where I live I live in New York City the history of New York City is full of slave chapters of the importance of slavery in New York City okay a country that is born in genesa and then graduates to become a slave what and we're not that far away from that slavery only ended you know a century and a half ago a little more that's not very long in historical time this is a country that identified its survival as dependent on mass murder in the Noto distant past wow it thinks it can solve problems with military the United States today 2024 spends more on Military preparedness than the next nine countries in the world combined and the next nine include Russia and China all the remaining are allies of the United States it's military it's completely out of control when the Soviet Union collapsed in 1989 it meant there there was no military opposition it's over they're not the Communist party is gone its power is gone you know the people want to be like Western Europe in Russia you know yelon and and uh now Putin these are people who believe in capitalism they didn't we they didn't slow down their military dominance they had to be military dominant you know and then when after 911 they had to be military dominant to deal with you know Islamic terrorists I mean it never stops n Russia and Putin is another Stalin and Xi Jinping is they live in this world because they always have they have to have the evil let me give you an example there's a tourist attraction I I I kid you not about three-hour drive from New York City and if you go to the little village it has the Old Colonial houses the first houses that were built by British uh people who came and settled here when when the when this was a British colony and if you go and visit you can see the old houses the way they were built and the furniture inside and and then there are information PL in front of each house where you can read a little bit of the history of that house the first time I went many years ago the first thing that struck me is on the plaques you read the following on the night of 1742 60 Savages that's the word 60 Savages attacked this house and Colonel and his wife Abigail had to flee the house on their horses to escape this Savage house after house it's a story of the good people versus the Savages that's exactly how Americans were taught to think for three centuries the Savages were the local people then the Savages were the slaves then the Savages were anybody who is opposed by the United States government Fidel Castro is a aage Putin is a Savage jingping is a Savage I it it never stops on the one hand it's pathetic and childish but on the other hand it has been the selfawareness to which American politicians revert when they run for office when they speak publicly this is the idiom this is the it's as much that as it is the English language that's what they have that's what they use that's what they think is expected of them and so they do that and you know and the Ukraine becomes a story of the wonderful good people of Ukraine vers is the Savage it's it's unbelievable the minute you take a step back and hopefully I'm conveying that to you once you take a step back you see it quite clearly but for the people caught up in it no one ever takes them a step out no politician would dare say these things publicly I mean there are a few always a few you know but no that's that's why you have the problem if the Israelis are our allies well then their opponents must be Savages and so you take the events of October 7 and you put them into that story The Savages did to those Israelis what the Savages did to those British immigrants in the Massachusetts in the 18th century it's the same endless Story the first thing a reporter does when he goes somewhere in the world where the United States is doing something is to see who's the Savage and who's the good guys and then tell the story this is often done by journalists who are not lying who are not aware of a different reality that's how they see the world they are products of a society that trains people to see the world that way I was born in the United States I went to all my education here in the United States it was this story was told to me 50,000 times in it's in the movie it's in the song it's it's everywhere if people don't understand that they will not understand American politics the way they don't around the world you know you know I don't mean to be disrespectful but the United States is losing in Ukraine that's not I don't mean to take away from whatever Russia has achieved I don't know I'm not a military person I have no special knowledge or understanding but when I look at these situations I see the United States defeating itself it's just it it it is trying to manage a world that doesn't exist the way they think it does and they're getting very frustrated because it isn't working once upon a time they were so dominant that it didn't matter okay so it didn't work they were still the richest the most powerful the most now when it doesn't work it's painful because they're not the richest and they can't buy their way out of this the defeat in Afghanistan is completely total the Taliban is in charge in that country and they has stayed in charge now for several years they withstood an American Military presence for I don't know 15 years whatever it was they weren't defeated by the United States which sent enormous military power over there this is and they're poor the Talib they don't have much money they don't have any resources they are they have their difficulties with their neighbors with Iran with China they're still able to Prevail if the United States weren't lost this would be the the conversation why did we lose what did we do what have we misunderstood nothing nothing nothing the loss is no loss when I I give public talks when I say we lost in Vietnam and I talk about or we lost in Afghanistan or we lost in Iran and Iraq my American audiences don't know what to do they sit in the auditorium looking at me like 5-year-old children who have just been informed that there is no Santa Claus he doesn't come down the chimney with presents for you at Christmas that's not the way and the children feel a loss they liked Santa he was a nice old man who brought them presents what's not to like and they have that moment of sad recognition the difference in my audience is is they have that same moment they see it and 10 minutes later they go back to the way they were before they heard me talk
