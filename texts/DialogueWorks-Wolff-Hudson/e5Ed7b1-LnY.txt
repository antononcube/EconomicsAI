so nice to have you Michael and Richard on again on this podcast and let's get started with the current situation of the economy of the United States and the question is Michael to you is the United States rapidly approaching bankruptcy well one Republican and now the Democrats uh ever since Obama sought to frighten voters into supporting an attack on social security by trying to privatize it uh with a right-wing Congressional commission he sponsored there's been a lot of deceptive rhetoric about the federal debt and how the budget deficit forces up to us to make uh hard uh uh choices uh hard for the people the 90% of the population who are going to have their social spending Social Security and other uh basic government programs uh squeezed out by uh What uh the both part Democrats and Republicans want to cut back the the real problem leading to bankruptcy today is private debt it's not there's no problem at all with government debt going bankrupt governments don't go bankrupt they can always print the money uh and in many cases the uh the going bankrupt can be a very good thing uh most obviously in the case of student debt if if private debtors were allowed to do what almost all other individuals are able to do to the student debtors what companies and financial institutions are able to do the student debtors could cope with their student debts by declaring bankruptcy that would say we don't have enough money to pay the student debts were were uh loaded down with but Joe B led the fight to privatize student uh to prevent student debt from being subject to the bankruptcy declarations thereby creating this unfair student debt crisis that we have today that makes students the only category in the whole American economy that's unable to wipe out its debts by bankruptcy and de free itself and the excuse is well we need to finance the government budget otherwise we're going to raise the government debt and the pretense is that uh if we don't uh uh make students pay their uh student debt then the government will go go bankrupt and uh as if somehow the government going bankrupt is like uh an individual going bankrupt well the major reason that uh Biden uh cited all this uh government needed the money is to uh uh basically say no we have to enable able the government to uh to avoid deficits that are contributing to the debt didn't say anything about uh the tax cuts for the rich or the unequal taxation or the fact that uh anyone who earns over 120,000 doesn't have to pay any of the increased income at all for their social security it's all paid to them by people who own who earn less than 120,000 none of that's in discussion well I want to put this uh debt issue in perspective and in order to do that I think it's uh necessary to uh think in terms of balance sheets uh in one way or another it's a question of who whom to whom does the US government owe uh uh its debts and I want to make two points clear that always should be made at the outset of any discussion first of all uh nobody ever got in trouble by running into debt itself the problem is having to repay it uh and to pay its carrying charges if you can't pay it down uh and I'll explain later uh the government has no intention or likelihood of having to pay a large part of its foreign debt so the second Point that's uh important to start with is to recognize that one party's debt is another party's assets U the government debt debt uh is a preferred access asset of most of the economy so let's look at who holds the government debt uh as an asset well with all of today's gloom and doom talk it may surprise people uh to see that the US uh debt is perhaps the most desirable financial asset on the planet that's why so much of it is owed uh owned by the wealthiest layer of the US population and that's because uh no uh nobody expects uh this debt to have to uh be paid at a cost to the government that may be surprising but it's obvious when you think about it the paper money that you carry around in your pocket is technically a government debt government issued paper money in order to finance uh some kind of spending and IT issues a paper money and it's you as its holder the holder has a financial claim on the government so each of you viewers who have the currency of any government in your pocket in financial terms you're creditor to the government whose paper currency you're holding uh and that makes you in effect a creditor to the whole society uh you don't think of yourself as a creditor uh because it's not that financialized but Tech technically if you look at the government balance sheet assets have to equal debts that's why it's balanced so you have government debt liabilities on the left side and ass uh on the opposite side the assets paper money is a big a chunk of this uh and if the government would repay this paper currency presumably by giving you something in return there wouldn't be any paper money left so of course the government's not going to pay this paper money uh and you think of money U being spent for what you buy especially in small amounts it's a grocery store similar venues uh but actually most uh uh US currency is held in $100 bills large amounts often they're packaged together in shrink rck large bundles that are photographed being uh transported out of US aircraft and paid to the dictators kleptocrats uh and politicians uh that were uh buying off uh most $100 bills and most US currency isn't held by Americans it's by foreigners uh the the phrase usually is people keep it in their mattresses uh and if they're living in a country with a uh bad uh a weak currency like Argentina but of course the people who have uh this shrink wrapped $100 bills don't put need to put it in their mattresses uh they have all sorts of storage rooms uh for that for that so the this US debt is the savings of a large portion of the the world's kleptocracy and also just people trying to look at the us as a safe currency compared to what they have uh they certainly have more faith in us paper currency than they have in their own uh for foreign currency uh and up this money is considered for saving not for spending well a second category of US debt is sort of like this it's the debt that's held by Foreign central banks is their currency reserves and you can look in the treasury bulletin every month the treasury bulletin uh lists who owns who is the US debt owned to who owns treasury Securities well a huge chunk sometimes onethird of the entire new is new issue of foreign debt is owned by Foreign central banks especially a few decades ago when military spending uh was very high and that's the essence of the dollar standard uh which I call the US treasury bill standard uh since 1971 when President Nixon stopped paying deficits in Gold uh foreign central banks uh don't really have an international asset that they can hold apart from US dollars so instead of General deal and the French being uh able to take the dollars that they're getting uh from us spending in Vietnam and uh southeast Asia in the 1960s uh they to buy gold uh now all they could do is buy US Treasury Securities and these treasury Securities uh that foreign governments hold are to finance the US budget deficit that is a largely of US military spending to create the 800 military bases we have around the world to uh surround countries and soort to force them uh not to abandon the dollar standard but uh they're they're financing their own encirclement uh and their own uh basic milit uh US military buildup uh against them and that makes uh the US foreign debt to foreign Central central banks a free lunch the us can just spend it as much as it wants the dollars that it spends up end up in the foreign central banks of uh Europe and also of China and they they uh foreign central banks don't have an alternative unless they're to use uh these uh dollar inflows and buy gold or something else uh and of course if they do that the United States declares them an enemy for trying to dollarize uh and essentially declares Financial war on them well uh this free lunch uh is something that nobody expects to be repaid uh the government the US is not able to create a enough of a balance of payment Surplus to pay Germany and France and China and uh uh Russia and Japan all of the uh Securities that it owes them uh so it it's not going to repay them and if a country uh says we want to dollarize uh like Russia did the United States simply confiscated 300 billion dollars of uh Russian money and paid it to the Ukrainian uh the interest of it to the ukrainians to help attack Russia to uh prevent it from going down that road well let me spell out just how this system works suppose you go to uh you could do what America America does and in miniature suppose you go to a grocery store and uh you buy food and other household items and when the cashier prints out your receipt uh for $30 uh you sign an IOU IOU $30 uh and put your name uh well that's not a credit card that's just you're writing a note aign note iow you $30 uh to or to the store or whoever should be the bearer of this note well the manager would come out and uh ask you well what am I supposed to do with this IOU and you could tell them well you can use this uh $30 IOU to pay whomever you buy your produce from you know they're delivering milk you know pay them partly in check and give them my IOU and let it just circulate around and it'll circulate and everyone will treat it just like they treat a dollar bill or a bank check it's part of their their assets well obviously that's not how the world Works uh for you and for other individuals but it's how the International Financial system works uh when the US spends money abroad and military spending is by far the leading category of uh the US balance of payments deficit that is pumping dollars into the world economy the recipients of these dollars in foreign countries uh will turn these dollars over to their central banks in exchange for domestic currency because they operate their businesses or uh whatever and domestic currency and the central banks then have these dollars is what they call their International foreign reserves or Sovereign wealth fund and uh invested in US treasury bills uh when the oil War happened in 1974 uh and the OPEC countries quadrupled their price their the price of oil they were told you can uh charge whatever you want uh for your uh oil but you have to keep all of your savings all the receipts you get from this oil you have to keep that in US currency uh we're not going to let you buy us companies we're uh but you can buy stocks and bonds but basically you have to buy uh uh put it in US Banks and buy uh treasury bills you can't really spend it for anything at all you're stuck with it and if you don't do that we will treat that as an active War so foreign countries count these unspent dollar receipts as their monetary reserves uh just as a a store might count your $30 as part of its uh its assets on its balance sheet we have an asset from a it would be listed on their uh receivables or or assets well uh by the way the Free Ride for the US government is what has led other countries to want to dollarize their economies that's what the bricks are trying to do and Russia has already done it since if it spend if it it holds any uh US dollar Securities the US will simply grab it uh the China is worried that the United States may do to it what America's done to Russia and simply grab uh all of its uh money at a point but uh it's hoping that somehow it can be be friends with the United States well we could discuss this debt later uh but that isn't the only debt that the United States government has no reason to pay uh a large and uh growing U uh debt is owed to the government's own Federal Reserve if the government wants to spend money into the economy uh it uh the asked the Federal Reserve to buy US Treasury Securities uh so the Federal Reserve has these owns these Securities and the banking system owns us uh Securities as U backing and reserves for its own deposits uh and Loans that's how a Banks work holding holding reserves so uh these uh this part of the US debt also isn't supposed to be paid uh and there's no way that uh the us is going to go uh bankrupt if the US had no debt at all there'd be no uh government debt to hold as Bank Reserves uh there'd be no reason for the Federal Reserve to exist uh you can see the problem uh so just like the paper money in your pockets this are the Federal Reserve holding foreign Bank holding of government debt uh are not expected to be repaid uh and I think this kind of financial maneuvering shows that the United States doesn't really have to borrow it can really in effect print the money but when it prints the money this money it prints is just like issuing paper money the uh the money at Prince is counted as a debt to uh the favor the Federal Reserve so it's all uh a a wash transaction sort of the illusion of a debt that somehow uh is in trouble well if we can get all these categories of the US federal debt out of the way then uh finally we have the kind of debt that most people think of the the treasury bonds and that are notes that are held by individuals uh especially by the wealthiest people uh the wealthiest investors all have a substantial Holdings either in US Securities uh the bond market there's been a flood a a run into uh the US debt as a safe haven just as the Congress is saying warning well the US is near bankruptcy Wall Street and the large investors and foreign investors too are calling the dollar a safe haven that doesn't sound like bankruptcy uh they're they're moving out of stocks and bonds uh out of other assets into uh the US debt because as the US economy gets more fragile and topheavy uh the they know that the US government can't go bankrupt because its debt is all in its own currency it doesn't owe foreign currency debt uh that it would have to print it owns debt in its own currency and it can print as uh much as it wants uh if you go to the bank bank or the the Federal Reserve and say you know here's my uh $20 bill you know I want I want to cash it in for money they can give you two $10 bills uh but that's all all you're going to get well a Abraham Lincoln financed the Civil War simply by printing the green backs uh and the green backs were technically a debt uh and uh that's that's what's happening so despite the enormous magnitude of US federal debt that uh Nema mentioned and the loud warnings of government insolvency when the financial Skies falling are the treasury bonds are viewed as the most desirable safest uh asset around Chinese officials have told told me that they don't expect the US dollar uh really to go down they're happy in uh to hold they're reducing their Holdings of dollars in favor of gold and other foreign currencies but they still hold enormous amounts of dollars because they expect them uh essentially to remain a strong uh currency so uh uh basically this the enormous increase in wealth that the wealth the uh wealthiest 10% of Americans have made since the Obama Bank bailout in 2008 this stemmed from the fact that uh that uh the uh us uh debt has been thrown onto the financed and created the largest bond market boom in history this bond market boom has uh only benefited the wealthiest Financial classes so if you here's wage levels and income for the bottom 90% flat for the top 10% it's gone up and up all this is financed by the government debt turning the stock in the bond corporate bond market into a Ponzi scheme so uh this is uh the the bright side of government debt and why you you shouldn't uh be frightened into having to solve it so the question is that I think uh maybe we should spend a few minutes discussing is uh why are people what's their motive in trying to frighten people about uh the government debt yeah I think maybe I can help in this in in this regard because there really isn't a contradiction between the uh notion of the financial markets that the dollar is the safest place or the safest form in which to hold your wealth the dollar obligations of the United States government given the way the world is working in other words the United States's position is shrinking the Empire is falling apart but compared to your Alternatives it's still a logical place for people with private assets to hold them in that uh form so that's the safety argument now the other part of the safety argument isn't spoken but I'm going to make it explicit now one of the reasons the dollar is safe despite the fact that the Dollar's footprint in the world is shrinking that the percentage of of Central Bank res reserves held in dollars is less now than it's been at any time in the last half century and on and on I could give all those statistics that you could want why is it still safe here's the unspoken Assumption of the private World which we'll see is reasonable the assumption is that the United States government despite the level of debt it's involved in and despite its shrinking glob footprint has an internal political capability of making sure that the people who hold that debt will not be in in any way damaged by how this problem gets solved in other words what they're going what they're doing is they're saying you can afford to keep uh your wealth here which we need you to do and here's what we'll do in exchange we'll make sure that the the angry people who are going to have to pay the freight of all of this will not be able to disrupt it here's what that means suppose suppose that the American people demanded of their elected representatives we want the Social Security of of having a retirement that we can look forward to after we reach age 65 or 66 or 67 we want to live in a society that honors a lifetime of work by not making you destitute when you're old doesn't seem like an extreme demand it's reasonable we want that and you know what else we want we want a health insurance from the day we're born till the day we die like so many other people have around the world and you know what else we want we want a free higher education we want college to be like high school and Elementary School it is something we as a society invest in ourselves like a public park like a beach like a state Reserve where you can take your family and go camping we want a higher education like most of Europe already offers its people for no fee at all no tuition no we want that all right you we all know because we live in the United States what the answer is oh the government can't afford it wait a minute what do you mean the government can't afford it the government is currently shelling out I don't know what it is right now but6 to800 billion dollars of interest on the national debt right now and it's forecast to become more over the next two or three years a lot more so the American people say okay don't pay the interest on the debt there it is then you have 800 million bucks right now and that's way more than you need to give us free education free health care and all the rest we've just asked for do that we elected you do that and if you don't do that we will unelect you and replace you with people who will oh my God say all the people in the world who own the debt that's the very important point that Michael made for every debt there's somebody holding that debt for whom it is an asset and they want to protect their assets they don't want there to be a risk that the United States government will stop paying interest on the debt so they're not going to allow so the American government's pledge to to them unspoken but very real don't worry we will cut back on everything to the American people to preserve your interest in getting paid off for that debt that you own that and that you invested in you European rich people you potentates around the world ripping off your own populations and investing it in dollars yeah yeah will'll protect you who don't elect us but who fund us and we will screw the American people because you elect us but you don't fund us okay so we're that's the deal no one will say that to you that's why it's so important that in the conversations things get confused about money more than anything else we are told GE will have to uh cut public services so we don't uh mess up the budget wait a minute Jack you don't have to cut Public Services you just have to stop paying interest oh yes but then people won't lend to us exactly and then what will you have to do you'll have to tax the rich people because there'll be nothing left unless you want to sell the Atlantic and Pacific Ocean and then there'll be a dispute about who gets that money no no you want things to stay the way they are and that's a system developed of by and for the rich and it is so gross these days that you need an endless amount of blah blah noise about money and other things people have had mistified all their lives people like me sometimes to me mention and I will at this point bear with me the greatest critic of capitalism so far I hope we have better ones coming but so far as the old guy KL Marx and he wrote as a young man it was in his 20s if I'm not Mist maybe his 30s but very young man he wrote something called an essay a short essay about 10 pages called The Power of money in Bourgeois Society unbelievable half of it is quotations from the the German writer GTA and the British uh giant Shakespeare he quotes in lengthy his own comments are half the article the others are quotations from Gerta and from Shakespeare and there he captures the whole mystery of money and why it has confused people all along and what's its stake it's extraordinary he went on to criticize capitalism because he understood its preservation requires something as absolutely Central as money to be absolutely mystified lest its function be actually understood what Michael just did is gave you a crash course in demystifying what this is what this is all about when the government of the United States the treasury issues the debt the IOU that the government owes you money it then sells a large part of it to another branch of itself the government this other branch is called the Federal Reserve it has the right to print money folks that's what it does it prints the money and it uses the money it prints to buy the debt of the other part of the government it is okay this is weird you should understand right off the bat this is very strange no wonder it confuses people but that's half its purpose you know in the old days the rulers would print money whenever they needed it for a new coach for a new Palace for a new war what and then people would get nervous oh my God Bron so we had a little special commission set up called the central bank it's supposed to be composed of very wise men and women well to be fair throughout the history of capitalism it's very wise men the women are few and far between even now and its job is to be an intermediary to make sure all of this is done what all of this is done with the same mystification as always only now it's a bit more mystified because between the government that prints the money and the rest of us we interpose a central bank who's supposed to make us feel all a lot better even though we know from the very documents Michael saw mentioned earlier how much of the debt Borrowed by our government it's borrowing from itself from the other part of the other office across town that literally prints the damn stuff now if you find that all terribly reassuring then the system has worked if you see through it you're probably a communist well Richard mentioned the magic word interest and uh while there's uh we're both in agreement that debt isn't the problem the problem if you're looking at the annual budget is the rising interest rates uh interest payments relative to uh the receipts of the government and Richard pointed out quite right that interest is rising now that the Federal Reserve has raised the interest rates from only 0.1% per year to four and a half to 5% uh in in recent months all of a sudden this means a huge payment of interest uh in the budget and that is going to increase the size of the budget deficit and that's uh you know I said at the start that nobody went broke uh running up debt but they get broke when they have to repay the debt or even to pay its carrying charges and interest is the carrying charges uh the interest that the uh government pays to itself the Federal Reserve the Federal Reserve under Obama said uh all the interest that the Federal Reserve gets from the government can now be paid to the banks for they can uh borrow from the Federal Reserve at nothing and they can put their own deposits back at the bank and this and get the interest that the Federal Reserve is paid by the government that was the big uh o Obama Deception for the most right-wing vicious Financial twist in history and it went completely unobserved by the financial markets except uh for Bas people who fin who follow Finance very very clearly but uh what you're going to find now and you've already heard burbles about it from the uh Biden Administration is if we're going to have this increase in interest payments we've got to have a the uh balanced budget amendment that Obama uh tried to create with the uh right Republican dominated uh commission that he appointed to uh try to get a a constitutional amendment saying the government must uh uh balance its budget so that its debt doesn't go up anymore well let's see what happened if this Obama Democratic party policy actually came through if the government had to balance uh avoid running a deficit subject to paying the emergency spending that every democracy has to do you have to spend uh more than now 40% of your Budget on Military because without without supporting fascism in Ukraine and in the Middle East uh uh how how can you promote democracy uh without supporting Ukraine's war against Russia and without declaring war on China uh and uh Middle Eastern countries uh and next to the military alongside of it you have to pay the the one 10% of wealthy people in banks that hold the government debt well that really doesn't leave very much left for social spending uh and the easiest thing to cancel is social security Medicaid uh grants and aid from the federal government to the cities uh and this is what uh uh Kam Cala Harris is pledged to do in uh if there is a democratic Administration and probably but uh uh Trump uh if he gets to be president also will do th this is the big squeeze that has been planned now for 20 years the plan to get to uh take social spending out of the hands of government and to privatize it well uh what are they going to do they're they're not going to Simply say we won't pay social security because that's a contractual obligation that the government has settled up but what they say is what we're going to do is uh we're going to take this Social Security fund and we're going to create uh a government grant to uh let's say black rock and uh uh other uh money management companies uh and to manage uh the Social Security in the form of a huge privatized mutual fund uh just like the uh Sovereign wealth fund of Malaysia uh was uh was handled by uh by Wall Street and criminally uh just ripped off by the Financial managers that's what fi that's what Financial managers uh do that's what Goldman Sachs was criminally prosecuted for for the billions of dollars that it embezzled from the money that it was supposed to be handling as a fiduciary from the Malaysian uh uh Sovereign uh wealth fund they want to do that with all of the Social Security fund and they want to take this money uh the government uh uh funding for social security you're paying every month and all that's going to be paid into this H mutual fund that's going to buy US stocks and bonds and uh the financial sector says if we can do that this will create a huge stock market bubble boom because look all this money instead of being paid into the government uh to finance uh it its War spending and the other spending that government governments do and now it'll be uh spent on the stock market and uh thank heavens the stock market is so over debt leverage now it's so uh s it's so almost insolvent that uh We've saved the stock market P Ponzi scheme from the brink of insolvency by giving the money that used to be paid to the government to the mutual funds put it into the stock market uh and then at a certain point uh in forecasters and the big money management funds will say you know there really not going to succeed they'll sell all of their stockholdings leaving the stockholders holding the bag just like they did in the south sea bubble uh in the 1720s uh and the Mississippi bubble that's uh that's how wealth is made you create a bubble uh you you uh mobilize a public uh belief that somehow this bubble is going to make money for you if you join it and then uh you you sell out you leave them holding the bag and let it collapse that's that's the plan that the Democrats and Republicans together are planning to do uh if they can do it in the next Administration and they'll package the whole thing or at least a large part of it as a quote unquote reform of the Social Security System Of course here here's how this scam works and I know many of you watching this program will have been you know provoked into worrying or thinking about this by various fragments in this or that news report you read about the social security system here's the way the scam goes number one you raise alarms here's the alarm the social security system is running out of money we don't have enough money then you'll hear an arod Professor sadly one of us getting up there and saying the population is getting older oh genius we got here it's getting older so you see there's more old people pulling money out of the social security system as a pension relative to the young people working and putting money into the pension system uh in their weekly check deductions the arithmetic is correct the conclusion is absurd Social Security either is or isn't a commitment a society makes to itself are we going to honor the people who give a lifetime of work whether it's in the factory or the office or the store or at home raising children and all the rest of it are we going to honor those people by giving them a decent secure re ironment or we going to throw them in the garbage and that tells you a lot about a society which way it goes on that one and you can see that around the world right now if you want to support older people as a matter of a decent moral or ethical Community let me assure you as an economist we have no shortage of funds available to do that no problem at all but that's not how the Social Security Works Social Security works by taking money out of people's checks now holding that money until they reach 60 whatever and then paying out a pension for the rest of their lives everybody knew that that was the system CU that has been the system from the beginning in the 1930s when an angry population of the American working class got social security for the first time in our history by mobilizing the labor movement two socialist parties and the Communist parties who work together to get that from the president at the time Franklin Roosevelt that's how this happened now first part of the problem do we take money from the checks of everybody answer no we never did we only take checks from the people who earn wages and salaries wait a minute aren't there people who earn income from interest they receive from dividends they receive from capital gains they receive yes what is the amount of money deducted from those incomes for Social Security answer nothing what yes how do the wealthiest people hold their wealth in America by stocks and bonds and and cash which generate interest dividends and capital gains so the richest people own the bulk of their wealth in that form which Social Security exist tempts from taxing for raising the money for pension you know what that's called grotesque Injustice that's what that's called the people who have the most money are Exempted from contributing to what the decent Society wants to do for itself wow that's like having clean water in a community carefully cleaned and maintained by the community for which the whole Community is charged except the rich people they get to drink the clean water and they're not charged at all why well because they're rich wait a minute what yes wait a minute what you ought to wonder but it's worse than that it turns out that not all wages and salaries are taxed only the first first I think it's now 160,000 a year something in that order that's very nice that is the bulk of us but you know who's exempt again Bingo you guessed it the super rich the people who make more than 160,000 here's how it works friends everybody pays the same percentage on the first 160,000 a year you earn on every dollar over1 60,000 no social security is withheld no social security is deducted so if you're a corporate executive and you make a million or two or six or 12 or 20 everything above above 160,000 you're not required to put into the pool for the pensions for our elderly you're exempt why because you're rich that's what got you the exemption exemption not what you know not what you do not who you are not how you serve the community no no no no no just because you're rich that's why unbelievable unjust grotesque and now comes the best the best part how could you fix this problem well instantaneously I've given you the answer answer you could tax interest corporate g capital gains and dividends put the Social Security tax on them problem solved no alarm no no social security running out of money not in this Century here's another one tax all income wages and salaries not just 160,000 all the way up look how much Elon Musk would have to pay and here's the beauty he would have to pay millions and he wouldn't notice but do we do that no no no we allow millions of Americans today I'm talking many millions we allow them to worry themselves sick over whether or not they will live on Social Security how much longer they'll have Social Security will it get cut back next year two years six years from now what should they do now about savings and pensions given that they couldn't possibly live already on the small amount that Social Security gives them those who are smart enough to know that Social Security did not go up over the last 10 years as much as inflation did so it's actually worth less now in terms of what it kind of afford you to buy than it used to put all of that aside but we're saving billionaires quantities of money they wouldn't notice they're losing rather than do something for the millions of people that are suffering it is a level of hard heartedness that makes any depiction of pre-depression America look like Child's Play in comparison so the these issues of debt these issues of government Finance they come right in and become not only a demystification trying to explain what's going on which Michael did so well but they also touch you right in your personal life if you're not yet an old person worrying about retirement and I want to remind you a third of the American people right now are doing that but even if you're not in that group you know what you are the children of those people and if they don't get a Social Security they're going to come and talk to you because you're their children and they'll need you to help them and you'll want to do that and that'll impede your Economic Development that's what's going on folks a shrinking economy a declining Empire is run by a group of of people at the top who who are doing what we all would have expected them to do they're offloading the costs of a declining Empire onto those below them in the social pecking order and that's you and me and whether it's pinching the Social Security or cutting back on funding for colleges or not allowing the college students as Michael opened up with uh to go and get relief in the bankruptcy course the way we allow all other private debtors to do don't be fooled they're going to cut everybody else before they damage the core of what keeps them the richest people on Earth and manipulating the money system is a tried and true way for the Elites in dying Empires to hold on for a few more years what Richard just said may sound so radical that it seems well that's utopian but it's uh it's less his idea of taxing the rich more is less Progressive than the original us uh income tax in 1913 when the income tax was first legislated only 1% of Americans had to pay income tax that's because income tax is paid only by those who made over a given amount something like 10 times the normal wage so it turns out that who paid the income tax were were large cor uh corporate investors large real estate owners and large Finance years the workers wage earners were not paid had to pay income tax at all they were tax-free and it in just over a hundred years the all there's been such a re framing of uh The Narrative of how an economy works the people have no memory that originally the income tax was supposed to be uh Progressive and actually was able to finance World War America's participation in World War I by these terms that only taxed what was called roner income uh rent recipients uh Financial investors uh and the at that time uh you ha in the wake of that ever since beginning in the 1920s you had the financial sector and the sectors that protects the real estate sector Insurance monopolies uh fought back and uh their first uh their plan was to financialized the economy and their great success was in the early 1950s when they developed the idea of corporate pension plans and uh the corporate pension flans were uh present presented as if now labor is a capitalist in miniature uh we're paying uh our workers in stocks so that the workers uh can actually own stocks in their companies put it into the stock market well the whole uh there were two kinds of pension plans one is make them co-owners of your own company uh so you would have the uh workers own more and more stock for instance in the Chicago Tribune uh the right-wing Republican paper of Chicago well finally they uh uh they uh once the pension contributions and stockholdings got high enough uh the Tribune uh was taken over by a financier who confiscated all of the workers savings since the 1950s in corpor in Tribune stock and used it to pay the banks that had lent him the money to buy the Chicago Tribune uh and for other people uh Who U pensions uh plans that uh essentially said well you know we'll put aside your pension and the stock market is it's going to be growing what that meant is that putting the money into the stock market and into investment Banks and into money man management funds created a whole financial system so suppose you work for a company and it was exploiting you and uh it was cheating you and uh but your the company said well just think of it you uh exploited workers your your your uh money is uh savings pension savings are put into our company so think of the pension savings you're making by our exploiting you well that's what's happened on an economy-wide basis by you uh investing pensions uh instead of on a pay as you go basis instead of making pensions a public obligation as it is in many European country it was financialized into the stock markets and now you have pension plans like kpers in California the California uh public uh uh retirement uh fun savings fund uh they there's the Pension funds throughout the United States have become desperate to turn their money over to private capitalists to promise huge fast gains in buying up firms uh downsizing them cutting back the labor force and squeezing out more money and leaving bankrupt shells in their place so that uh industrial employers uh employees uh who put the money into their pension plans or financing the de-industrialization of the economy instead of its industrialization that's the kind of plan that uh the uh politician donors uh would like to see uh trans translated into what to do with Social Security in that same way the problem is the financialization and finance capitalism has turned out to be just the opposite of the industrial capitalism that was described in the 19th century not only by marks but by everybody else yeah and I I would like to just if I'm going to play the role of of of radical uh a bit you know capitalism but says that profit is the bottom line my colleagues in Business Schools Across America who who I know and who are friends of mine are constantly telling me that their basic message to students is if you want to build your business you go where the labor is cheap and the market is growing and they said very good they say to their teachers thank you very much uh I'll be reporting back to you from China because I'm going to China because the wages are low the market is the biggest one in the world and it's growing faster than everyone so it's kind of obvious where I should be uh I'll see you later you you're stuck in Chicago or Cincinnati or somewhere else I'm going to Beijing or Shanghai I I know where you've taught me I should be if you don't like the results of capitalism which is the deindustrialization of one part of the world after another come on let's remember Once Upon a Time Capal ISM was what we celebrated in New England then it left you know it went to the Midwest Ohio and Pennsylvania and Wisconsin and you know what's left in New England to this day those factories four five stories high nice long brick buildings that now are full of artist Studios potery shops and yoga lesson businesses because that's all that go into these empty factories and now what do we call the New England uh the the Midwest we call it the Rust Belt of America because it's abandoned capitalism abandoned New England went to the Midwest abandoned the Midwest went South went West and then predictably you don't need to be uh a fortune teller here why would they stay inside the United States they decided finally wait a minute the same logic that it's more profitable that we can force the countries we haven't yet gone to to bid for us to go there and thereby use the profit mechanism to bring jobs to their part of the world we're we're ready to go we're ready to go to China we're ready to go to the Moon capitalism it's always this funny thing about capitalism it wants you to see the good parts when it grows when it expands when it discovers something and those are fine as long as you don't forget it has the bad things you know we live and life is wonderful but we also die that's another part of our existence capitalism abandons you want to go to a place that capitalism has abandoned visit England visit the industrial Heartland of Europe now basket cases that are the seeds of a fascism growing everywhere in Europe and where in the abandoned areas where industry isn't anymore when it was that's the reality folks of what is going on here the prophet motive is a builder and a killer if I can be allowed another quote from Marx early in volume one of capital he makes the remark yes capitalism he says is a constant producer and reproducer of great wealth unfortunately he adds it is likewise the producer and reproducer of great poverty one is the other side of the other and that's what's wrong with this system that's why we can do better and all that we've been saying is a kind of an illustration that when it comes to organizing an economy the one we have in capitalism has achievements to its credit no question but we live in an advertising society and I don't mean that as a compliment in advertising notice something the client pays the ad Advertiser to say only good things about the client true ones or make them up but they have one quality in common it's all good and what do they hide everything that's bad every that's a way of communicating to people that has nothing to do with what we're told as children that you have to see the plus and the minus you have toit the pro and the con you have to give a balanced contribution to understanding the world you live in no no no no no advertising is giving you a carefully constructed unbalanced view you're going to hear from the Democrats wonderful things about KLA Harris that's all and you're going to hear from Mr Trump wonderful things about Trump that's all they will allow themselves to put zebra dooo on the other one that's advertising mentality capitalism's gifts to us is the advertising business which has corrupted the whole process of speaking and of language it means that half of what Michael and I do and what Nema is so good at organizing is the demystification trying to recoup something remotely like a balanced sense of the economic system so that we can do what creative human beings have always done better than what they have found when they were born into the system that's all we're trying to do here we can do better than capitalism and we ought to stop not learning that lesson so what we're talking about is the narrative uh and if you can pierce the uh who when you hear a narrative like uh the government is broke or uh we've got to balance the budget what is it that they want you to do uh the any narrative that you get these days certainly by politicians is a an attempt to shape how you're perceiving how the economy works and your place in it to make it to make you do and support some policy and this policy is uh paid for by the people who back the narrative and U as Richard just said we're trying to suggest a different narrative because nobody's paying us so and it turns out that the less you're paid for a narrative probably the trer it is yes that's right the less you've been bought off to to to stop whatever else you're doing your enjoyments your pleasures your hopes your dreams in order to make a buck it's it's awful that that this everything intrudes between you and the and the the best in you because it it it questions or threatens your survival it's an extraordinary system it has lasted and done as much as it has by virtue of that but it's done now and I I don't think it's going to be salvageable I don't know any more than anybody else does where it'll break first and how and how quickly and none of that I can't predict the future but it is crystal clear to me that the hold of the traditional truths is slipping a little more every day and it's that that I also personally hold on to as a basis for for what I do and I think it's what animates people like Michael and Nema also it's this sense we've got to do something and here is something we can do we can say look the world isn't quite the way it's made out to be in the mainstream media and let let us show you what remarkable insights this can help you to develop and they can make your life better yeah just Richard we have here some questions from our audience and you may answer it one of the question is point to you Richard it says if the government prints money at at will then why do they need to tax the public good point yes it's very very important that that people understand here is the question Richard you can read it at the screen yeah if the government prints there are many reasons like like all big decisions that are made in a society especially if they last over a period of time as this one clearly has governments have been taxing as well as printing money for a very long time this is not in any way new some of the forms of it are new but the phenomena of these two sorts as very old okay so one of the reasons for it is the way capitalism particularly and and it's older than that but the way capitalism works you have this absurd and I mean that absurd situation you could divide the the population in any capitalist country between those who are corporations and rich on the one hand and everybody else on the other 10% 90% whatever you want however you want to do that and all right now here we go both of those two groups the people at the top and everybody else want services from the government corporations want the government to protect their wealth to protect their freedoms to protect their profit making to enhance that to subsidize them as needed to secure a foreign market for what they produce to secure cheap sources of foreign inputs to what they they have a whole list of things they want the government to do and the massive people just for the sake of argument they have their list they want public education they want Health Care they want decent roads corporations want that too and they would like uh help with with babies and all kind swimming pools you name it okay okay that's what they all want now comes the question how's this going to get paid for they want the government to do it how is the government going to do it and here we can see very clearly corporations in the rich would like lots of things done by the government but they don't want to pay for it and the massive people want lots of things done by the government and they don't want to pay for it well you can't have it if somebody doesn't pay for it so what have we got we've got a system in which we tell the mass of people everybody's got to pay their fair share and so we have a tax system very old we're all going to benefit from these things the government is doing at least we give lip service to the idea so we all have to contribute okay we have a tax system right but the but people at the top unlike the rest of us they have the money and they have the power to do a lot more than want something they can make it happen that's what it means to be a corporate CEO or on the board of directors or to own a billion dollars of wealth you're in a position to do things and and so what do you do you arrange a for the taxes to be brought down particularly on you on corporations and the rich so you push the tax burden onto the middle and the bottom but beyond a certain point and here's where things get creative Beyond a certain point the mass of people can't remember they're the ones who get the wages and salaries and Beyond a certain point you're going to have a tax revolt every country has had it we've had it too remember started back in California several decades ago and swept the country tax revolt okay the people at the talk realized now we've got to play a game we announc a tax cut and we make very sure that everybody gets a little cut you know 5% for you 10% for you and 40% for us oh we get that kind of tax cut the best example of that is the 2017 tax cut that Mr Trump achieved the only economic Innovation if you want to call it that that Mr Trump got past his was a do nothing four years of empty crapola which Mr Biden copied I understand but nonetheless these are competing Pro capitalist countries so he facilitated that with his 2017 tax cut but and now here comes the creative most creative part when you cut taxes on everybody telling the people that you can do more with less you know you're cutting the fat out of the government as if when you cut the taxes it has no consequence on the on the services you can provide having fooled people maybe you then say okay but here's an even even easier thing instead of taxes will borrow the money isn't that wonderful we can give you what you want we give you the corporations what you want we'll give you the mass as what you want we won't tax you because you don't want that we'll borrow the money isn't that wonderful it is as long as you don't understand what Michael just spent you know almost an hour explaining who does the government borrowed from he went through it it borrows from individuals of course who the richest you know how you know it's only the richest because how many times has a government official come to you in the privacy of your home or office and talk to you about making a big fat loan to the government the answer is that's never happened in your life that's because you don't count you don't matter the government borrows only from the rich or from other countries or from its own Central Bank that's how the government borrows and that's great for the rich because they get to avoid taxes but instead of paying the money in taxes they give the money as a loan to the government which pays them interest and then pays the money back this is called a no-brainer but if it's a no-brainer to the advantage of the rich it's a no-brainer in a different way for the rest of us you got to have no brain to accept such a system this is a hustle as grotesque as selling you the Brooklyn Bridge for $18.95 if you can't recognize that hustle when it's offered to you then maybe somewhere somehow in some other universe you actually deserve the hiding that you're getting this is a system designed of by and for the people at the top and I don't mean the American system and I don't mean the I mean capitalism as a system because this game is reproduced in one form or another all over the place that's why some of us are critic of capitalism yeah then let's let's just wrap it up wrap this session up with the latest news that the link that I've sent to you from the article of Ted postal is talking about the new strategy of the United States considering nuclear weapons and they're talking about that this is a strategy of preemption but do you see putting this part of nuclear bombs aside do you see any sort of connection with this type of strategy and with the economy the the the the war that is going on between the United States and Russia and China in terms of their economy do you see any link between these two discussions on one part the military part on the other part you see the the economy at War well the United States hoped to bankrupt Russia in the 1980s uh by uh arming uh under the Cold War uh so much spending that they thought they that forced Russia to make a mirror image uh spending of its own military budget and they thought that this is going to bring down the Soviet Union uh because they don't have as large an economic surplus uh as as we do and uh that will force them to uh squeeze their economy and cause public discontent uh including discontent among the own ranks of the Communist party uh people and it will just uh demoralize them so if we can increase our spending forcing other countries to uh spend their money uh the uh the theory was their populations will revolt and vote somebody else into Power well that's just what NATO thought in uh uh in the uh 2022 when uh it kept stepping up the attacks on the russian-speaking uh ukrainians and tried to do everything they could to provoke Russia into war and the idea once again was that they could force Russia to uh counteract uh the NATO attacks uh on civilians in uh donet and uh uh the uh luhansk uh the the Eastern Ukrainian Russians speaking regions then uh Russia would number one have to divert its uh income to uh War spending and it would not be able to industrialize uh and become more self-sufficient uh in its industrialization uh and number two since uh Russians were going to have their soldiers dying uh the American National Endowment for democracy and other uh propaganda uh organizations non-government organizations in Russia uh would be able to try to Fan the Flames of a popular discontent uh and uh obviously that didn't work but uh that was the plan so when you bring out a suggestion what you just did this enormous increase in atomic weapon spending uh number one this is a bonanza for the military industrial complex in the United States because most of America's atomic weap uh haven't been uh cleaned and uh spruced up for the last 50 years a there's a question do they still work anymore do we have to take them apart and fix them uh uh and do we need new technologies to somehow uh invest in America to keep up with the Russian technology of the Hypersonic uh missiles and everything it turns out that America's plan to bankrupt Russia with military spending is backfired and it's uh it's uh threatens to bankrupt America with military spending uh and the U the The Narrative of all of this is Being Framed by how we begin the show The Narrative is in order to afford this military spending to threaten to blow up the world and uh start civilization all over again in order to uh Finance this we have to cut back Social Security and social spending uh and interest payments to the uh to the the bond holders so all of this is an excuse to spend enough money on uh nonsocial purposes in the United States that it crowds out the budgetary leeway for the social spending programs that uh the voters actually want uh and of course to do that you have to make a duopoly between the Republicans and the Democratic party you have to make them into a single party preventing any third- party access on the ballot uh such as uh uh Nema you and I have discussed when we had Jill Stein uh the anti-war candidate from the green party on there uh the both the Republicans and the Democrats have tried to make such a labyrinthine set of rules to get on the ballot that really uh Americans don't have uh any option to on uh The Ballot Box to but to vote either for the Republicans to do this uh arming uh new Cold War arming or the Democrats to do uh the mil remilitarization you can vote which one is to do it uh and uh each party has its own identity politics uh but you can't have any party that is trying to urge peace you're seeing this whole uh charade being uh performed last week in Germany when you have the two anti-war parties uh Germany's talking about to to preserve democracy we have to ban the anti-war parties because uh without going to war we cannot support fascism throughout the world we have to support the Ukrainian fascists uh against uh uh Russia and if a party is formed the uh either the alternative for deuts or the sarag uh party uh we we have to prevent them and just not let them take a position uh in Parliament because that's anti-democratic Democratic is what benefits the United States in the Cold War that's what we define democracy is the Cold War autocracy is avoidance of War autocracy is the bricks China Russia Iran and other countries withdrawing from this whole financialized system so they not only have a different narrative uh that we're talking about they have a different vocabulary as George Orwell had pointed out so we're talking on your show you know every week not only about the narrative but about the very vocabulary that is meant to shape how PE myshape how people perceive and uh uh what they think is happening in the world let me let me only add uh something you know let me put on my hat as an economist for a moment um Michael is right the the the the contest the war contest the arms contest whatever you want to call it between Russia and the United States which in some ways goes all the way back to to the end of World War II was a very clever strategy whether it's George Kennan who gets the credit or or some of the later people in the state department they understood a very simple thing which I don't think Americans ever understood that the United States came out of World War II absolutely unique dominant economic Powerhouse and that all the potential competitors economic competitors were gone Russia was gone China was gone Germany was gone Britain was gone they were Japan was they were all gone either destroyed by the war indirectly or literally destroyed in the war directly now this was not a sustainable arrangement it would eventually end but for a good while I would argue for the rest of the 20th century the United States maintained its dominant overwhelming position therefore a context an arms race between the United States and Russia was a kind of a bad joke one was sitting on top of an economic Powerhouse the other one was sitting on top of an economic disaster Zone did there was no this is crazy as recently as the last time I looked two or three years ago the GDP Americans don't get this the GDP of the of Russia three years ago was around one a half trillion dollar per year the GDP total output of goods and services for one calendar year roughly one and a half trillion in that same year the GDP of the United States was about $22 trillion okay everybody has to stop right one and a half versus 22 and that ratio isn't all that different now from what it was before an arms race between a a military based on a $1.5 trillion economy versus a military based on a 22 trillion I mean that that's not a contest though you know what's amazing about that the level of military production that the Russians were actually able to undertake they they you can tell even if they didn't admit it that the priority they put on Military was obviously enormous maybe the Soviet Union was a challenge to the United States using the word you Loosely in politics and in military but in economics never not close no way at all so an arms race between them is something the United States could confidently think it would win we are not in that situation today and that's part of what's going on we are not in the same right now the the the GDP of the United States is in the neighborhood of 23 trillion last time I looked the GDP of China about 17 or 18 trillion that's a completely different story put China and Russia together and you have a high priority on the military and a bigger economy and the Chinese are mountainous bigger economy with a Hightech sector second to none this is a new game if you assume you're going to win the arms race now you're crazy you've lost touch with reality you are not in the same situation and you're going to make terrible mistakes and the first clue of how bad the mistakes are is the mistake made made when you decided that all Ukraine needed was your weapons and your money to overwhelm Russia wrong why because Russia has China and Russia has bricks and Russia has allies and Russia has options you didn't figure you thought you were where you once were but you're not you're just not and the result is a new framework which you haven't figured out yet I listen to the neocons running our foreign policy these days the blinkin you know the Jake Sullivan those folks they sound look and speak like cold Warriors they're still there they're in another place with other calculations that made a certain sense then dangerous risky but they had a certain law now you get the danger you get the risk but the odds they're not there the context is not what it was in fact it's pushing the other way more so every year this is a losing proposition but they keep losing and they can't think their way out they lost they couldn't win the war in in Korea they lost it in Vietnam they lost it in Afghanistan they lost it in Iraq they're losing it in Ukraine they still don't get it that's why I think we're much closer than any of us dare hope for the very big changes I think are coming well give him credit uh Richard we did beat Germany uh and 2022 it's now completely dependent on us we beat Europe yep but you know Volkswagen which is in its greatest crisis Volkswagen is the emblem industry of Germany the great success story The Great you know up until last year more vws were sold in China than any other brand of car etc etc etc they are now in a crisis they've announced they're about to close factories all across Germany which they have never done in their 70 years of History before they're in Desperate trouble but they know why be careful what we what we see is the surface which has to Plate the United States for all the reasons Richard has in I'm sorry Michael has in his mind and they're right but right below the surface there's a whole another layer of German IND industry which says as Michael was about to say it's the American policy in Ukraine that makes the vira's vunda of Germany disappear we knew we had no vunda we don't have greater technical skills than the French do or the British do or the Italians do stop We Know Better what we had was cheap oil and gas the cheapest oil and gas of any European and with the with the pipeline that the Europe the Americans blew up we would have had it for the next 30 years we we are screwed and because we were the engine of Europe all of Europe is screwed are we really going to go into the rest of this Century becoming a vassel of the United States when we really didn't have to this is the painful question that sits right below the surface not just in Germany in France in Italy in in Britain itself they are they are at a crucial point I'm I'm not sure which way they're going to go I I understand what Michael is saying they may have sold their whole future they have made Europe which by the way just a footnote for everybody Europe the European Community is now the richest single block in the world it's a bigger wealth block than the United States it's a bigger wealth block than at least the original bricks or at least close to it it is gone or maybe which would be a remarkable thing for that part of the world that has been the center in many ways of the world for centuries for Millennia to be to be pushed aside in this relative short time by a relative newcomer the United States and an utter newcomer China capitalist China as opposed to earlier I really do believe therefore that these conversations beside being interesting commentary from the left and all that that would be enough but I believe more than ever before we are on the edge of a lot of these under theeg ground cont predictions coming up to the surface and we're going to be talking about how things could change so quickly when in fact our discussions have been documented that these are long running changes that have been building for quite a while yeah thank you so much Richard and Michael for being with us today great pleasure as always yeah good good conversation and um Michael had left let us know I hope I'm not revealing anything that he was worried that he was going to give a lecture on money and but I'm glad he did I'm glad that we structured it around that because I think that topic needs it and we more than once and and that we we'll have a chance I hope in the future go and revisit some of these questions again exactly see you soon bye bye byebye
