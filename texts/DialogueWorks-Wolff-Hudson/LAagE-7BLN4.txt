why was the EU despite having such an economic system not able to have a grand strategy on their part when it comes to geopolitical problems that they're facing right now well just as there are many different kinds of capitalism there are different kinds of socialism uh the uh the European socialist parties basically have been shaped uh since 1945 by American political interference uh through the National Endowment of democracy and others uh the Socialist parties in Europe uh you can summarize their policy uh they want to lower wages uh they want to support neoliberalism uh and most of all they want to fight Russia uh just as they wanted to fight the Socialist uh the Soviet Union so uh the Socialist parties today of Europe are against everything that uh socialism prior to World War I was for and everything that socialism used to be uh the the uh when you had Tony Blair and Gordon Brown uh they uh adopted neoliberalism and out thatcherized Margaret Thatcher uh by going far enough to uh uh privatize uh the the transportation system uh the health system making a disaster out of it and uh the same thing with Reaganomics in the United States uh so the question is you know what socialism and if you look way back I I think the real way to answer this is to look back in the history of European socialism and uh in a way you could say the first socialism was the the Roman Catholic Church in the 11th century uh in the Crusades uh their kind of socialism was very authoritarian uh they wanted to and almost all Utopias uh in Europe were authoritarian Thomas Moore's Utopia uh there's a a tendency of IDE idealism uh to be uh very uh authoritarian and uh uh you could uh look at all Humanity but you don't look at a individual uh Freedom uh well by the 16th century you had uh uh you had the uh impoverishment peasant revolts and uh The Peasant revolts created a a kind of uh socialism uh of idealism Thomas muner and uh uh the later utopian movements the anabaptists and the menites and the hites uh a lot of them ended up uh realizing that they couldn't uh make a change in Europe and they immigrated to the United States and became like the Pennsylvania Deutsch uh uh who left Switzerland uh to create an idealistic Community uh angles wrote a wonderful pamphlet that still uh uh is worth reading socialism utopian and scientific so the question is are you going to be a utopian and if utopianism you end up somehow with the neoliberal travesty uh and the Scientific Socialism was uh the Marxist value and uh price theory that was developed uh but most socialists in Europe became social Democrats and that's sort of the Bersa middleclass party and uh they were uh their idea of socialism is well we get rid of the land Lords we get rid of the monopolies we have public health uh we have public education uh but they really didn't want to support the wage earners because they were uh potential businessmen the Social Democrat parties sort of thought of themselves as capitalists in miniature uh and uh they thought that well uh they can they they they want their own chance to make money and to make profits just not for the uh for this to be done as in as exploitative way similar phenomenon occurred in the United States mid they were the Socialists in America were largely in the midwest uh against the railroads against the big employers uh going on strike against the Pullman company strikes uh they were they were uh uh pro- unionization uh and uh the the other socialists were on the East Coast many of them were immigrants especially the Jewish boond and the uh anarchists like Emma Goldman all of whom were deported under uh the right-wing woodro Wilson Administration who really Set uh the uh Democratic party uh and most of the American politics to say the role of socialism is to fight communism and to fight Russia and you had that uh you had that sectarianism that essentially broke socialism not only in the United States but in Europe into a of small parties uh acting over you know what was uh the ideal and they were fighting each other uh much more than they were fighting U the the deterioration uh and oppression of uh industrial capitalism into Finance capitalism uh so as I mentioned you get uh Tony Blair and Gordon Brown and they're really isn't uh what we used to call socialism uh is a movement uh in Europe uh or in the United States for that matter that uh uh they're not even for a mixed economy anymore by going neoliberal they don't they don't even want the government sector they want to privatize almost everything and the belief that that's efficient and uh the whole concept of socialism has succumbed to what uh we were talking about at the beginning of the show what is efficiency what is productivity uh and who's going to do the uh the planning and the definition of what uh efficiency and productivity is all right let let me come at this from uh a couple of different angles uh number one European socialism today and Europe as a whole today is a wonderful example of how mechanisms and institutions that are progressive under some circumstances if they are not changed can turn into their opposites and hold back human progress later on so the the two things I would bring to your attention that are famous that come out of Europe number one everything that goes under the name colonialism the Europeans leave their area and take over Asia Africa Latin America not 100% but most of it and subordinate those parts of the world to their own needs uh especially economic number one number two they compete in that process and thereby strengthen enormous difficulties differences and hostilities among them because the oppression by the British Empire included what they did to the French or Belgian or German or other Empires and vice versa the end result is that now in the 20th century Europe finds itself hopelessly separated into a you know a whole bunch of small countries that cannot function in the world of large countries countries and with a residue of Suspicion hostility and hatred from all the people they abused as Colonial Masters and they are therefore hamstrung by the very things that made them wealthy made them powerful are now bringing them down that's one fundamental thing then the second thing as I want to pick up on something Michael said at the beginning of his response socialism are different they always have been only in the caricature of anti-communism and anti-socialism do all of these things become one indistinguishable Mass so let me very simply explain about socialism there are I would argue three basic basic ways that people who call themselves socialists are currently organizing their economies the first one is the European it's not only in Europe but just for Simplicity of making the points here and the idea here is you leave the economy basically in the hands of private Enterprise driven by a profit motive more more or less competitive depending on the power of Monopoly finance and so on and that all that socialism means is that you soften the hard edges of that kind of economic system the government comes in and maintains welfare helps out the people that are paid wages so low they literally can become socially dangerous and you provide provide certain public supports to the extent that the working class is strong enough to fight for politicians that will actually do that I mean it's important to remember that real achievements by socialists still exist in Europe a young person in France who graduates from high school and enters a labor force or who graduates from college and university is required by law to be given five weeks of paid vacation by his or her employer for Americans This is an unheard of luxury in Europe it's taken for granted as our universities that do not have any tuition as our national health care services that are provided as a matter of Human Rights and as a ban on capital punishment as another human right I could go on but that's real I don't want to take that away from those that's a kind of socialism now there's a second kind I'm going to call it the Soviet socialism here we go very far in the direction of the government taking over not just regulating as they do in Europe not just helping with certain social services but literally uh in industry and to an considerable extend in agriculture as well the government becomes the owner operator of the Enterprise and that has a long history I won't go into here and here's the third the third is a hybrid of the first two that's what I would call the People's Republic of China a roughly 5050 split between private Enterprises regulated by a government and public Enterprises owned and operated by the same government difficult to manage so that you have a very powerful uh Communist Party sitting a top all of this with its entire government apparatus to manage these are different Notions of what socialism is and what we know from the evidence is if you're measuring in terms of economic growth and I'm not arguing that that's the right measure or the only measure or the best measure but if you use that measure then it's crystal clear to me that the Chinese variant has been more successful at solving that problem of economic growth than capital ISM ever did or than the other two kinds of socialism ever did and that the whole world is now confronted with what I just said what are you going to do when you have a system like in China which has been able for the last 30 years to grow their economy 5 to % per year which is three times what the West is able to do which continues to right now and shows no sign of going away I mean the this is the enormity and the Europeans are the are the laggards in all of this their socialism is the weakest in terms of economic growth their socialism is the most broken apart into uh fights between small units I mean they can't get the Italians together with the belgians I mean this is bizarre what what they are unable to do you have parts of them that are so broken down and I'm thinking here of uh the United Kingdom they're so broken down that not only can they not question their pathetic capitalist system but they actually decided that what was wrong there was nothing to do with capitalism had to do with the fact that they were part of Europe so in 2016 they vote to leave Europe as if this would solve their problem I could have told them in fact I did tell them it's not going to solve your problem it's going to make your problems worse which is exactly what it has done and by the way that's going to make the labor party under Mr starmer the new government in England later this year when they have their election the polls are overwhelming that the British people want this government out of there and it isn't just because of clowns like Boris Johnson it's also because the British effort to find a way in this situation they're lost and they they have nothing left and the the only thing that's preventing more of them from going in New Directions which they're going to do by the way the only thing is they are now afraid any of them to break because of the hostility from the United States that any effort to break would immediately incur the United States is not going to hesitate it looks upon the the Europeans as useful idiots that they can manipulate whether it be in Ukraine or now in Israel Gaza you know the mystery which is a mystery for only people who don't want to see it is that the United States lets Europeans know you go a little bit too far you you know you're off the list and we will favor everybody but you and you will become the The Whipping Boy every one of you can become what was done to Greece a few years ago and they all know it and they don't want to go there and they're afraid so they can't break out their situation they're all pretending loyalty that's what they're lining up for Mr zalinski is all about but it has nothing to do with Ukraine about which nobody in Europe cares it's about their condition in this realm of socialist alternative models and how to manage that problem amidst the declining us Empire and a rising Chinese that that's the Dilemma well we're in full agreement when it comes to our views of Europe and uh uh British socialism but uh I you made a number of points about China uh that I think are very important here in the United States uh they keep calling China a centrally planned Communist economy and you're absolutely right China is the most decentralized economy and has been for 30 years uh they call it socialism with Chinese characteristics but you could just as well call it industrial capitalism with Chinese characteristics because it's a mixed economy uh and that's very important there it uh they are did not begin with an economic Doctrine they are they developed for 30 years on an ad hoc basis and U when they had their uh post Mau Revolution they very carefully avoided having marxists uh come to there because they didn't want to uh emulate the Soviet system they wanted to sort of let a 100 flowers bloom to the point of inviting Milton fredman from the University of Chicago over uh that convince them well let let private Enterprise take off and so what China's done is uh not uh you have very little central control by Beijing of uh the cities and The Villages throughout China that's left uh it has been left so far to uh local administrations uh uh to develop and the idea is well let's uh try to shape the environment by providing uh for the whole economy basic uh human rights basic government services basic uh support for what they're doing uh but let let the localities on their own uh the only problem with this so far is that there hasn't been uh a revenue sharing or I should say credit sharing between uh the central government and uh the localities uh which have had to finance their public uh spending and social spending by selling land uh and you've had uh real real estate developers uh developing the land and uh you have Shadow Banks uh banks that borrow money from the central bank to lend out to home buyers uh and you have uh the kind of overbuilding and uh Rising uh real estate prices that have occurred now and if you look at the financial times and the Wall Street Journal for the last few days at the Davos uh uh meetings in Switzerland they're all saying well China's going to collapse right now it's all going to be over it's reach the end of its growth because look at the deths that it's run up for its uh uh Its Real Estate and some of its corporations well this is a complete Mi Mis misreading of how China is developing I can guarantee you that China is not going to stop its economy and saying oh we have so much debt uh before we can invest any more government money uh we have to make sure that the creditors uh don't lose any money on their investment in uh uh the big real estate companies uh that have gone under uh and the others they're either they're going to write down the debt which they can do because most of the debt is ends up being owed to the China the Bank of China the Central Bank itself or China can say well I guess a lot of the small lenders are going to go bankrupt and uh we'll make sure that the average depositors the wage earners come out okay but we're not going to rescue uh the financial investors who've made bad loans loans that have gone bad to these companies so that China is able to uh have a uh a debt insolvency without wrecking the entire economy uh but the Americans and the Davos uh uh crowd look at this and say oh there's no way that you can possibly write down debts there's no way that you can possibly let the banks lose money or the bond holders lose money or the stockholders lose money uh so China's got to collapse there's no understanding that it's uh uh it's basically a pragmatic economy looking at how do we really go ahead and China is doing is taking an engineering an industrial a materialist approach to the economy saying uh we're not concerned with making money for a financial class or a landlord class we're concerned with putting in place actual tangible means of production to provide more good and services uh to raise living standards and productivity and that's why they're growing so much more rapidly than uh the Western economies but the Western economies can't uh acknowledge this they they're the ideological ones that if they were to acknowledge the why China is succeeding by not doing what the West is doing then they'd have to do something different and they're not going to and that's why President Biden has said China is our number one enemy it's their number one enemy because it's showing that there is an alternative to Western Finance capitalism that there is a socialist uh uh alternative and that is as long as it exists there goes Margaret Thatcher's motto there is no alternative and there goes the hope that somehow you can make the United States and European economies uh as productive as uh China has become rich the the only area where I would uh there's not so much disagree but when Mr Biden refers to China as the enemy uh I understand what Michael is saying but I also believe that the United States States has been a society that from the beginning has had to do something very odd I mean it happens in other parts of the world but not as often and not as systematically as here when one person aggresses against another one of the saddest side effects of that act is the aggressor blaming and excusing the aggression by demonizing the person against whom you're committing the aggression as if they were the culprit aggressing against you let's remember the United States is a place to Which Europeans came and slaughtered the population we are a country born in ethnic cleansing it took a 100 or more years most of the 18th and 19th centuries to fight an endless series of lopsided Wars that were massacres and often called massacres because it was so lopsided most of the time and in the United States let me give you the example that may upset some from 1917 to 198 9 there was a demonization of the Soviet Union the great enemy we have to do this the great enemy which imposes on us having to do this the aggressor in most parts of the world for those 7 odd years was the United States and its allies not the Soviet Union and I want to remind you the United States and its allies was you know 20 times the economic Powerhouse that the Soviet Union ever was there was no threat to the United States from the Soviet Union for most of its history even when the Soviet Union got nuclear weapons there wasn't much of a threat given the imbalance so now the Soviet Union doesn't quite play the role for a while because they overthrow their ostensibly socialist government and we quickly have to find another one we found it for a while in inational terrorism this was not so good because it's vague I mean who you want someone to hate and so we conf we we were so desperate as a nation we transformed the abstract idea of terrorism being our enemy by picking a few of the most weakest absurd little potentates among the so-called terrorist countries Saddam Hussein how was he portrayed in the media he was Hitler we did it or he was Stalin or look at how they're dealing with Putin now he's another Stalin we we can't even invent new major enemies we have to rec Christen those we find now with the tried and true terrible enemies of the past so yeah now Xi Jinping or or China can be play the role yeah we have another enemy to justify the cost overruns of the defense producers with which we started uh uh today's uh economy and finally a footnote to what Michael said I think there's a remarkable thing about the Chinese that doesn't get the attention Michael used the word materialist he was trying to make the point that that they're very practical trial and error let's try this let's try that um something by the way that used to be called pragmatism and used to be something that Americans boasted as a peculiar quality they were proud of okay now the Chinese uh are doing that kind of thing and yet the Western media is so desperate not to look at China in anything other than their the same boring terrible enemy mentality looks at the apartment buildings that are built before the people are ready to move into them which by the way is a very ingenious way of avoiding a housing crisis in where in a country that has moved hundreds of millions of people from one part of the country to another and if they didn't build ahead of it they'd have one of the greatest slum problems in the history of the world which they don't have and which most of the West does have and then I remember to the building in the United States of our interstate highway system long before the traffic merited it and we were lucky that we did because it helped develop the post World War II boom that could not have happened without that Highway construction so the Chinese are doing what the United States did but the United States can't even remember its own history to ask why this might be a wise thing to do even though that's what happened in its own country here again the kind of self Blinder that is the sign of a system that's going down well uh I think that uh you pointed to a very uh important uh inefficiency of socialist economies and the Soviet Union in particular they're under constant military attack from the United States this forces them to divert uh much of their government spending towards military defense in order to prevent themselves from being overthrown uh as soon as the Soviet Union was formed you had a British and American invasion you had continued subsidies uh of uh uh opponents as soon as World War II ended uh and Germany was defeated uh the Americans and the British hired as many uh uh Nazi administrators as they could and hired them to uh create NATO and to become administrators throughout Latin America and other countries to fight against the Socialist parties uh and uh today the uh the 800 military bases that the United States has built around uh uh Eurasia uh imposes an overhead on economies accused of being socialists and therefore enemies of the United States uh they've had uh their GDP would be and living standards of course would be much higher if they did not have to uh cope with uh the the attacks by the United States and Europe and the sanctions that America tried to impose first on uh Russia and then on China uh last week as part of the runup to Davos uh there was a discussion between the Chinese and the Europeans were criticizing China and saying well why uh won't you balance your uh trade it's that not unfair that you're selling much more to us than we're selling to you and China said well why don't you sell us some of the uh uh the Dutch uh ultraviolet ship engraving machines oh we can't do that the Americans told us not to do that because that would help your economy uh this is uh this the the belligerent character of the West that is of course we're back to what we opened the discussion with Pentagon capitalism is the United States has tried to uh prevent socialist economies from developing along a socialist Track by increasing its military industrial complex is a gigantic technology rent recipient uh at the uh expense of the rest of the economy when the U uh Senator uh uh the politician who uh you quoted at the beginning of our discussion said look why can't we produce enough bullets uh to uh uh to enable the ukrainians to to bleed Russia the whole reason we're fighting in Ukraine to the last Ukrainian is to uh uh essentially to try to make Russia use all of its copper and lead and whatever it makes its bullets out of so that it has less money to use these raw materials to actually make useful uh productive uh material uh but a byproduct of the American attempt is uh the the tanks that it's made the airplanes that it's made the arms that are made they're not really for fighting as you've seen in uh in Ukraine they're they're falling apart uh in the Ukraine uh they they're being uh just destroyed at will by inexpensive drones uh these these tanks and airplanes and missiles are for parades not for really fighting and when you actually have to fight uh that would require a whole different uh uh engineering bit so uh you essentially you're having uh this uh the the American economy is not only imposing a military overhead on the socialist economy enies that are uh not invading anybody China has not invaded anyone uh it's been invaded uh by the same groups Mongolians that invaded uh Russia it's the United States and NATO that are doing the in Invasions and and uh the United States is now insisting that uh to help the US balance of payments uh Europe has to essentially join NATO and uh rearm uh because uh is pres President Biden and blinkin said last week uh Russia if Russia wins in Ukraine it's going to right walk right through Poland uh right through Czechoslovakia and regrab Germany and it's just going to occupy uh all of Europe and uh next is London and next they're going to be in Brooklyn uh this is the this is the crazy uh worldview that we're uh talking about and it's all uh pared in the New York Times and Washington Post as if uh this is uh real world economics and not junk economics and junk politics I don't know I'm afraid to continue this conversation because we're opening up as we should and as a responsible public media ought to you know new ways of thinking about and seeing and understanding the parade of headlines that we are all engaged with every day and and your program gives us the chance uh to do that and I'm therefore very grateful to you for for creating these kinds of opportunities but I I will say and if you don't mind that I always find it a little bit daunting because as you get into a kind of conversation like this in a way where both Michael and I provoke and enable one another to take it another step uh it's very interesting I'm learning and I'm grateful for all of that but you go further and further and you begin to realize that this is unusual what we are doing that this is not in the New York Times or the Wall Street Journal or the LA Times or any of the other major outlets for this kind of thinking and it isn't means that there's a systematic editorial policy that precludes so that part of what Michael has just described is not uh accidental it is part of a deliberate notion of the United States as a global hegemonic power uh whose job it is to secure That Power by basically making every corner of the world subordinate and serving which it was able to do let's remember the history we we come out of World War II King of the Hill the only conceivable economies that might have competed with us are all destroyed Britain Germany Russia China Japan they're wrecked they're destroyed United States after after Pearl Harbor no bombs fell here no no war was fought on US territory after that and the result was the war did the opposite where it destroyed all the competitors here it put to work the people that had never gotten jobs in the long depression of the 1930s the war came here and rebuilt the economy by the way a footnote to something Michael said that's what's happening in Russia Russia is using the Ukraine war to stimulate by fiscal policy an enormous boost in the Russian economy so not only will it will there this war not break Euro Russia down bring it to its knees and all the other junk that came out of the highest levels of Washington it's having the exact opposite effect and the biggest irony is that the United States who went through exactly that experience in World War II can't imagine that it could happen in Russia that bizarre lapses of the Mind what what's a world going on what is this this the most amazing you know selective memory that one could imagine well I think there's uh no truth to the rumor that President Biden is really a Russian agent uh but certainly all of the uh uh the sanctions that he's imposed on Russia uh everything that he's tried to block other countries from providing Russia from cheese and food to Industry uh Russia has done what any country under sanctions does it's developed it itself so it's not only the attack the military attack on Russia it's the sanctions that have said well Russia you know because we know that you're the neoliberals and the westernizers have influenced you a lot and you're sort of hesitating to provide protective tariffs to your industry like America and uh Germany did in their uh industrial takeoff so we're going to help you by U pro uh sanctioning your economy which is the effective protective tariffs so that you can build up uh all of your industry that's certainly uh the economic effect just as uh when America put the sanctions on uh computer chip exports to China uh they've uh set their uh graduates to work to develop new breakthroughs and even more efficient uh computer chips uh and when you impose sanctions on a country you lose that market forever America no longer has the Russian or the Chinese markets for what it used to uh uh be able to export Europe no longer has Russia and China as markets because uh once it's St St uh uh selling to them they produce the goods themselves and they don't need uh uh Europe anymore and so what you have is uh Russia China Eurasia Iran the bricks plus that have now uh taking a new shape not needing the West at all uh they all they want to do is turn their back and leave uh your uh NATO and the uh United States economies just to go uh shrinking along in their own way and uh in a kind of nihilistic uh economic way that they're doing and be left alone uh the United States and NATO uh are trying to whoop up uh enough support so that they can keep trying to interfere and somehow slow this alternative uh to uh Western Capital Finance capitalism but obviously it's not succeeding we've seen we're seeing it's not succeeding in the uh Persian Gulf uh or the Red Sea uh were is not succeeding in the near East uh it's uh losing everywhere and uh unless the United States can uh uh conquer the near East by fighting to the last Israeli and opposing China by fighting to the last Taiwan ECE by convincing them uh to go along and be America's Foreign Legion uh basically America doesn't have an army you you we begin this talk by talking about America American Military uh uh production but where's the Army to use it what's the point of having tanks and arms and airplanes and missiles if you don't have an army to fight and America doesn't have an army because no one wants to fight anymore all they have is Isis and uh any other C Ukraine and any other country they can convince you know let me give you an example because sometimes a little example can tell you a huge part of this story uh this is an illustration of the point Michael was making three years ago the number one exporter of automobiles in the world was Germany yep the number two was Japan sorry if I have it correctly the other way around number two was Germany number one was Japan this last year Russia jumped excuse me China jumped and became this is just a couple weeks ago the report came out in this last year China became the number one exporter of automobiles vehicles in the world both electric and fossil fuel powered vehicles jumping over Germany and Ja who had held that position before okay little lesson in economics if you're the number one then you are going to get whatever economies of scale this business has and by that I just mean the benefits you get from the sheer number of units that you produce so you can make it cheaper per unit because you use up materi materials you can buy them more cheaply because you buy larger quantities you can process them more cheaply Etc in other words China is now boosted into a position of if not dominance near dominance of of no minor industry automobiles how did China do that you're going to love this because of the war in Ukraine the sanctions imposed on Russia we won't buy your oil we won't buy your gas we may not buy your fertilizer your grains all of those things led to a collapse of Exchange Trade between Europe and Russia so Russia stopped buying European automobiles or American Automobiles and they bought Chinese automobiles instead and that took China up to number one gave them a market size larger than everybody else therefore access to economies of scale that are going to make them an even more formidable competitor in the automobile business than they already were so here here you fight a war and you are shooting your yourself in the foot and you're doing it repeatedly and you're pretending either that it isn't happening or that it doesn't matter and you're doing it again and again and again these are signs of a system in extreme distress well at least when you're shooting yourself in the foot you're making business for the milit for the uh shooting the gun manufacturers look at that's right an extra boost for them
