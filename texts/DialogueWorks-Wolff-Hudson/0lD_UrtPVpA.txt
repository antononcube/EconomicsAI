hi everybody today's th February 13 2025 and our friends Michael Hudson and Richard wolf are back with us welcome back glad to be here let's get started Michael with you and how did you find the call the conversation between Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin in your opinion what was the importance of this well Trump was trying to make nice by acknowledging that uh Russia actually had a role to play in defeating the Nazis in World War II uh that was very gracious of him and uh all what he really did was just here's a table of contents for what we're going to talk about uh and nothing uh very specific I think the whole frame for this discussion is a comment by President Putin that he made a little while ago about Europe they will gather around their master and slowly wag their tails uh the interesting thing is Europe's response to what uh Trump and uh Putin talked about uh Trump had no reason to talk to Europe and say I'm going to call uh President Putin here's what I'm going to say no reason to consult them at all uh and every reason not to because America spent the last few decades creating a leadership uh in Russia people like VLAN and the crazy Estonian uh foreign minister of the EU uh saying that Russia's uh in a powerful position to attack us and if we don't stop them in Ukraine we're going to have to stop them in England uh this is just like in the Vietnam War if we don't stop the Viet Kong and Vietnam they're going to be an America Next this is this is crazy but it's it's a narrative that is aimed at the domestic audience in the US and obviously European voters also as if Russia is a threat not a promise and the whole idea was all along to try to isolate Russia and I think U Trump has recognized that this simply is not the uh not the case at all and the uh Secretary of War that he appointed hes hes uh was right was open in this he said look the uh Russia's winning uh much of Ukraine may end up in being Russia there's no way America is going to uh Supply troops to Ukraine Europe is on its own and you can imagine where this leaves Europe uh it's depleted all of its uh Weaponry stocks uh and now Donald Trump and the European uh pro-military right-wing is saying we have to spend 5% of our GDP in order to replace the stock so that Russia can't just Mar March through Poland and Czechoslovakia and Germany and France and uh uh threaten England and this is crazy uh the Europe is in a crisis now with such a a high GD GD such a high demand for military with without GDP growth that it's having to cut back domestic spending and Donald Trump has been having conversations about this with Europe and said well why don't you uh send your industry over here to the United States uh and Europe is think oh my God we've been abandoned well that's what America does to its allies we back with What ginger said uh it's fatal to be a friend of the United States and that's exactly what's happening so you're also having in Congress well well uh Trump is trying to uh talk to Putin and acknowledge that the problem isn't Ukraine there's a whole War that's been going on the whole NATO War the whole Cold War of which Ukraine is only a single front he's trying to uh take he acknowledges the need to take the whole big picture into account including Russia's needs for its own self-defense meaning there's not going to be a European peacekeeping Force meaning British terrorists bombing uh Russia uh from right behind the demarcation uh line uh Trump is and Pesca I'm the the uh Secretary of War uh have taken a realistic point and the interesting thing is how much this being attacked in Congress by the Democrats uh who lost Ukraine they're trying to say we had a chance to win in Ukraine under Biden uh Biden didn't give them enough bombs he didn't give them the atom bomb uh he didn't let them show how strong America is you're hearing these bizarre uh Democratic political American uh America strong comments and the fact is the the issue is who lost Ukraine how who enabled Russia to be so strong that now uh three years into the war Russia is in such a strong position that America that Trump uh the president of America and his cabinet are saying okay the the Biden uh strategy the neocon strategy of trying to fight to the last Ukrainian and thinking this is going to exhaust Russia's military academy uh military capacity that's all gone by the line Russia's military ability and Army and arms are much stronger Europe's arms are depleted and politically at home the voters are turning against the Ukraine war and against the poverty of ever having split away from uh Russia and China uh in the first place so now there's a there's an irreconcilable approach and the screams that you're getting from Europe these are the people that are on automatic pilot that the United States has pushed into commanding Heights vondel as I said the Estonian and uh they are unable to follow uh Trump's realistic uh at least approach to sitting down and talking uh and it's crazy uh but the the one thing that I'm sort of amazed at that Trump has been bringing up Putin is well we we've spent $500 billion dollar in Ukraine now we want the money back we want its raw materials that happen to be in donet and luhans we want their lithium we want their raw materials uh and uh zalinsky sold fair and square to uh to American firms all that's crazy we can talk about that that later I'll let uh Richard pick up what's happening here but you're you're having a real Clash of uh the the participants don't understand don't agree on what the reality is on the basis of which to make an agreement at least uh Trump and Russia are a little bit closer uh Europe is not close at all and Europe is being excluded just as zinsky is being excluded is not relevant Rich yeah let me try to add some context uh to this um when the United States gets itself into moments of extreme difficulty which happened periodically it's not just now I think it's worse now than it has been that as we've discussed on this program many times that we are in a period of a decline Empire that's a 100-year project that was built up it's now declining and we're also at a time when American capitalism is not only losing its Empire but also losing its position within the world economy and those two things are related but not exactly the same so that's a very serious challenge uh to its future and I want to go back and look at another moment of challenge at the end of World War II it it was a moment of extreme difficulty for the United States why because the thing it feared most the Soviet Union was left standing the hope that Hitler and Stalin would each destroy the other and that they would be both gone when it was over had turned not to work out Hitler was gone the Nazi machine was gone but Stalin was if anything stronger than he had been before and the proof of it is the Eastern European corridor from the Baltic states in the North through Bulgaria in the South they were strong and then something happened that made it really extreme namely the most populous country in the world China joined the Soviet Union completed its revolutionary Civil War ejected Chun kek onto the island of Formosa about which the United States could only pretend then as now that they had a chance to control that country that that little area's future and then here's the point Republicans and Democrats stopped their comfortable Tweedle Dum Tweedle D exchange a few years for you a few years for me none of that looked as though it could work there was a real crisis and the Republicans then took the position of excoriating the Democrats by saying you lost China hence the parallel with what Michael said you lost Ukraine the interesting thing is the reversal in the in the 50s it was the Republicans who rode that claim into office and now it's the Democrats who hope to ride that claim into office it worked so well for the Republicans that for the next 40 to 50 years anti-communism because that was the way this was uh framed anti-communism undoing the evil influence of Communists who had engineered the loss of China this story could be told and re told to produce a global movement against Russia NATO and to promo promote an Asian equivalent and to promote inside the United States a half century worth of Relentless ideological battle against every first the Communists who were converted from militant new dealers into agent agents of a foreign power as soon as the Communists were killed you had the movement Across America to teach the American people that socialists because we had a two strong socialist parties here that socialists are just like Communists the only difference is they spell it differently the words are different but it's all the same and you can't be a communist and you can't be a socialist because you are literally a military political threat they they deport I want to remind people the United States deported folks because they had been members of the Communist party and they defined membership in the Communist party as the equivalent of advocating overthrow of the United States government by force and violence that's a quotation in other words they Define find membership in a party as an imminent violent threat to the social order okay I want to argue that we are in a comparable crisis this time it doesn't have anything to do with socialism and communism because of the American need to pretend that that issue is resolved and part of ancient history so the crisis now is the is the collapse of the Empire the war that was lost in Vietnam the war that was lost in Afghanistan the war that was lost in Iraq and now the war lost in Ukraine this is not a good record for the last 30 40 years it's awful and you can't keep pretending that it isn't and likewise the long story short the rise of the bricks who now have a collective G GDP significantly larger than that of the G7 on the western side they now have 60% of the world's people and more than than the United States and the G7 worth of wealth I mean uh it becoming literally impossible not to realize that the American dominance is over it was already being challenged when China joins the Soviet Union but now the challenge is if anything bigger and deeper and more frightening so what do you get you get a level of turning on each other between the Republicans and Democrats that even makes po World War II anti-communism look mild by comparison people are now threatening each other in the halls of Congress we saw that the January 6 you know few years ago they wanted to hurt each other they wanted to kill each other and that that means something okay now to the immediate presence one of the things that happens in a declining Empire and we've seen it in earlier declining Empire periods is that the center of the Empire begins to jet to throw away its own allies it's a little bit like an airplane having difficulty deciding to throw its cargo overboard in hopes of lightening the plane and getting a few more miles to a safe airport that's done all the time the United States is now thanks to a kind of Reckless Trump who having defined himself as different from the establishment as against all of their folies and to do so with Brash bullying you know theater so he uses that theater in in the three or four weeks he's been in office to kind of overwhelm the world and it's mostly theater and much of it will come to nothing but there's a kernel that's part of this larger context that I want to end with putting 25% tariffs on Mexico and Canada talking semi seriously about Canada being the 51st state this is throwing your allies under the bus Mr Trudeau has now a very difficult choice to enrage the United States and hurt the economy or to Pander to Canadian nationalism by being the one who says I will quote him from last night uh snowball's chance in hell is if the United if they ever become the 51st state okay he wishes he was not in this situation because in the end he loses either way he's gambling on which will be the Lesser cost to him that's all you have a little different situation in in Mexico but it is really profound ever since NAFTA and you know we're now talking 30 years for 30 years the United States actively encouraged Enterprises American and foreign to set up shop in Mexico and Canada in order to take advantage of the whole point and purpose of mafta which was the free trade area and he's simply Mr Trump by what he's doing is nullifying much of that investment making it worthless 25% if he actually means it and if it doesn't work who knows he may raise it he's raised tariffs elsewhere I believe today at some point he's going to raise Global tariffs again all right uh Here's the the the the economic absurdity what capitalist in his right mind would undertake to move production say out of China or out of Vietnam or out of anywhere and either back to the United States or to Mexico or to C in a situation like this that would be lunacy it takes years to move production it takes makes huge amounts of money at best it's a risk but with this President and the way he acts and the level of problems he's encountering you'd be even crazier than normal to undertake a we so the promise of Mr Trump to resore American industry by virtue of these tariffs is ridiculous that's not going to happen it's kind of an economic War Fair that's what the sanctions against Russia were look how well they did not at all this is just another version by the same idea use the economic power of the United States as Michael said a few moments ago as a bomb threat all the time but these threats are becoming empty the sanctions against Russia the Russians mocked them and they're the ones laughing all the way to the bank and now the United States angry at Biden for a failed economic Warfare of sanctions is lining up behind Mr Trump's parallel economic war of tariffs with all of these crazy Pro promises you know when I taught economic trade international trade if you've ever taught that in a University and I have and you look at the textbooks which I've done they all have sections on tariffs because tariffs are old that's not a new idea countries have been doing that for centuries so there's a vast accumulated literature on when they work and when they don't work and why they work when they do and why they given all of that the glib promise that this is going to have all of these wonderful con consequences strikes me as exactly as idiotic as a notion that if you took away Europe as a market for Russian oil and gas Russia would implode because there's no one else to buy the oil and gas it took Russia a few weeks to find the alternative namely India and China that bought the gas and the oil and of convers the only interesting thing about that story is the capacity of American policy makers not to have taken into consideration what could happen from their economic Warfare they are doing exactly the same thing the same people who mocked Biden for the failed economic sanctions are now lining up with the same chorus and the same lopsided ignorance promising the Moon from this tariff War it's extraordinary to watch and it all makes sense if you see that this is a declining economic system flailing around trying this trying that not worrying about the contradictions not worrying about its own lessons Mr Trump is heaving tariffs while he actually sits down with the evil Russians to work out the partition of Ukraine and Europe amazing amazing to me yeah Michael go ahead well I want to start my commentary where uh where Richard began and try to follow the sort of long spiral of one thing leading to another because one thing does lead to another and did uh he started by pointing out the parallels between uh the end of World War II and today and that's a good parallel the United States in Europe uh n 1930s through the all through World War II wanted Germany to bleed Russia and Destroy to destroy it uh and uh somehow lead to a regime collapse of uh Stalin's uh communism that didn't work but today again they want want to do the repeating the strategy they want to use Ukraine and Germany which is the most uh uh anti-russian pro-military uh country to bleed Russia and bring about uh a regime change at a great cost well the Richard rightly pointed out that this uh the way in which World War II ended was on a way that established Europe's dependency on the United States and if you look at how this happened in the nitty-gritty uh the United States and Britain uh in 19 44 1945 sat down to decide the outside the post-war world how they were going to lend Britain uh the money to uh recover at and the cost was to break up the British Empire that Britain had to abolish Imperial preference talk about protectionism uh Britain had to give up the fact that uh during World War II India Argentina and other countries had built up huge Holdings of Sterling and Britain had hoped well when peace comes they're committed to spend this uh holding of ser Sterling that they've built up during the war they spend it on on us and that'll enable us to recover well England uh argu sat down with the US and uh the US negotiator said look uh you're going to be broke and you'll go bankrupt and we're not going to lend you the money to get by and support your currency unless you give up the Sterling area make free trade and England said well wait a minute our industry's been destroyed if there if people can uh if we get rid of Capital controls and India and austral and Argentina and other countries can spend these World War II savings anywhere then it's all going to go to the United States and the US said well that's it well the House of Lords uh had a a big debate 1944 and they realized that the uh Churchill and government giving away the whole shop because Churchill was very pro-american uh he didn't mind England giving up the Empire uh to the United States because he thought there really wasn't an alternative so they uh the US and Britain together designed this postwar uh Pro Us world that Richard dis doed and the Continental Europeans were not uh consulted at all the anglos uh us agreements for the international monetary fund the World Bank and uh free trade and uh no Capital controls was presented to Europe as a fetac comp plate well uh let's see the parallel today uh Trump realizes that he can't really use a deal with Europe and confront Russia and say well we've agreed with Europe on what the post order is and uh Europe insists that we put uh European troops and Adam bombs right on your border so that we can knock you out in five minutes if uh we don't like what you're doing and we want it do to you today what we failed to do in 1945 uh well obviously that's uh not going to work that was the neocon policy that was the Biden policy the America the idea of American Empire was we can bomb any country that doesn't uh submit to our kind of rule that finally the us or Trump at least has uh dropped all that so uh if he can't use Europe to confront Russia what he what he can do is talk to Russia and say okay we're uh not in involved with Europe but we know that uh Europe right now is attacking you in the Baltic uh attacking you in the North Sea they're trying to stop your uh shipping we know that they're are Nazis we know that the Nazis in Europe uh in in Germany especially uh want to do to you now what they didn't do in 1945 and World War III but we're we're going to leave them to their own uh devices we're we're not going to spend more money on Ukraine meaning the Cold War and uh if Europe wants the Cold War With You Russia they'll have to spend it themselves and we know they don't have any money because their hatred of you their revived Nazism of don't have anything to do with the Russians their agreement with uh zalinsky and Ukraine that the Russian are slavics and the the almost racist hatred of Russia leads them to not uh want to import Russian gas they it's lead them to create economic suicide uh Trump has said well the European dreams of Empire are gone we're not going to let uh uh we're not going to join their suicidal self-destructive uh hatred uh and behavior we're going to try to break that and uh I Donald Trump am going to try to uh save our relationship and the hopes for peace from the neocons in my own Administration I'm trying to uh clean out the CIA I'm cleaning out the state department I'm cleaning out the FBI I'm cleaning out all the aid and the regime change uh uh National Endowment for democracy and all of the covert uh activities of the United States all these are being uh uh cleaned out so that we can now uh have the kind of at least nominal equality that um you President Putin have been talking about all these years so Europe's uh left out of the negotiation and uh uh there's really not nothing that it can do uh except in a rage now is America's policy is uh is it also is losing its Empire as Richard has just been describing is America going to emulate Europe in its self-destructive policy by somehow refusing to acknowledge that uh the Cold War really is over I think there's part of trump to say well it's cold war isn't over we're just changing the venue uh where it's not going to be a military uh fight in Ukraine or in the near East uh or in China uh we're going to use economic force uh and and Trump says well we're going to deal with that part of the Empire that we know that we can hold we're not going to try to draw up Russia and China and Asia into the Empire but uh we're going to draw not only uh the Western Hemisphere Canada uh Mexico uh and Latin America and but our satellites in Europe we're that's going to be part of EMP our Empire at least we can survive drawing money from them and he's outlined all sorts of policies that I I could go on but that's for a later part of this discussion today so I I think that in that sense he's redefined the American Empire is not incl including uh an attempt to take over Eurasia uh not trying to uh defeat Russia and China but trying to figure out some way to work with them in a way that America can somehow work with them and uh come out ahead in the deal uh that's where he gets into the fantasy land uh thinking that somehow uh he can make a deal where we win you lose and uh the next stage probably by somebody else will be uh if a regime in America comes says yes the Cold War is Over uh we're going to take our half of the our 15% of the world population English speaking in Western Europe the 85% can go its way we'll try to deal with them as best we can uh without making uh a structured World Financial system without weaponizing international finance international trade in the way that Trump is still trying to do so that's the dynamic that is at work right now yeah let me add and I understand that this is a speculation and I understand that nobody can predict the future most of what Michael said makes perfect sense to me I want to add a couple of things first there has always been as part of everything Michael described another kind of fantasy that has captured quite a few people in Washington and it is currently capturing more partly because everything else isn't working and that is to try to build an alliance with Russia against China in other words to flip the coin to say that the Democrats held on Way Beyond what they should have to a cold war that had run out of gas long ago and wasn't relevant anymore uh Communists were not in charge of Russia anymore uh and were eager not to go back in that direction uh and that they therefore might be persuaded with the appropriate mixture of incentives and threats to consider an alliance with the United States mainly built around anti-chinese racism maybe all kinds of possible combinations that the United States could find perfectly amenable I don't think that's gone away I think that's still there and my suspicion is that M when Mr Trump and Mr Putin get together this will also be discussed even if only as each one feels out how much support there might be for moving in that direction and my understanding of the wisdom of the Chinese is they've thought of that also and they also consider how that might happen and what that might mean and then all of them might you know get together the Chinese the Russians the Americans and decide that the lubrication for a rearrangement among them would be carving up Europe amongst them so that the the the feeding off of a Dying Europe which would bring full circle the colonial period simply reversing who's colonizing who after all that's the history of the United States in Britain we were the colony they became our colony which they still are watching Kier starmer be a gungho supporter of of Ukraine verges on the obscene it's so crazy but that's what happens when Empires when Empires die when Empires get desperate and don't know what else to do I may make fun and Michael and I may make fun of Trump's efforts but they are also have a pathos connected to them a desperation trying some way to avoid what is going on and it's not working Mr Trump has to do much more of his theater in his second presidency than he did in his first because his first didn't accomplish very much it's already been forgotten other than the big tax cut in December of 2017 what didn't do anything certainly didn't stop the the great issue the decline of the Empire the growth of bricks if anything he stimulated it to go even faster and then the Biden even faster than that but I don't think it's their fault I think it's a process they are unable not only not to stop it or reverse it but even to guide it a little bit seems out of their uh seems out of their reach but I am mindful that here in the United States thanks to the mainstream media and how it is subservient that none of these sorts of con questions and and ideas and analyses and speculations and I'm sure we Michael and I we make our mistakes we things we don't see and but we are all Al I mean not but there's very few of us daring to talk like this the mainstream media are still engaged in massive denial of most of this there's a reason half of Americans are not aware that Vladimir Putin and Joseph Stalin are not two leaders of a continuing dangerous Russian threat I've encountered it too in public speaking I have to explain that something happened in 1989 and 90 that was actually important because for them and then I one day I had a little moment a little mini Epiphany when I realized that Biden and Anthony blinkin they haven't understood it either Russia is still for them the great Bugaboo problem it's extraordinary how denial can feature in the way individuals populations and and the whole world can at least for a while delude itself well the fantasy that uh Richard's describing that somehow uh Trump and the Americans can convince uh Russia to join uh China uh is actually being discussed in the United States so it's not his fantasy he's describing the fantasy that somehow uh the United States can uh trigger the antagonism towards uh uh China to at least have one enemy to justify all of this enormous military and Industrial spending uh and I think one of the things that uh Trump is trying to cut back and trying to cut the deficit remember let's talk about his nutty economic philosophy he thinks that if you cut the federal uh uh deficit somehow that will stop inflation and make uh the American economy uh more powerful and enable it to reindustrialize and uh his way of cutting the deficit is not only to stop spending in Ukraine the 500 billion that he's uh claimed uh but to uh stop the military spending in general uh against China he would love to have uh Europe pick up uh any of the Cold War expense but to shift the U focus of NATO away from Russia uh the North Atlantic Treaty Association is now uh the West Pacific treaty Association and uh the fight against Taiwan uh uh and China this is so the reason this is nutty is because uh it assumes that other countries will will simply say okay we can just change our alliances like that and that and go back and forth and that this will somehow uh persuade other people uh to trust us not to shift again and then turn to China and say okay we'll we'll I'll join with you and now we can carve up Russia and give a you Russia's natural resources to you uh which also is discussed so all that uh Russia and China have to to is to call Trump's fluff and say well you know we're not going to do that uh we've met with President she and you uh America and your European uh puppy dogs to wagging their Tales have uh driven us together and uh it's done uh you've driven us together and we're an alliance uh let's uh talk about something else next topic and this uh calling the Pluff is not only available to uh Russia and China but uh since Richard mentioned Canada and Mexico before other countries can say the same thing uh the United States can threaten to disrupt Canada's trade in aluminum steel and uh other Imports uh here and uh Mexico certainly maybe even Little Canada uh can say well if uh you're saying that you don't want the economic relations that we negotiated under NAFTA in good faith thinking that once you negotiate a treaty like you're asking Russia to join against China uh you can just turn uh we're going to have to find someone more dependent so we're looking to uh China uh to defend it and NAFTA has had the effect on destroying our agriculture by uh letting free trade in Grain uh enable American Farm producers to undersell uh grain prices and so oh our Farmers have gone out of business but now we can uh we're not in that anymore we can have the same kind of agricultural protection policy that President Roosevelt uh designed in the 1930s that uh protected American Agriculture and uh promoted an enormous capital investment and productivity Agricultural Extension services new seed uh varieties marketing Services we can turn to China and says uh we know that U you're you're going to you don't have anywhere near as much Farmland as you have population and we know that the drought is affecting many of your areas let's uh make make a an alliance an economic alliance between Mexico and China and we will try to grow uh the crops that you want you will provide us with what we used to depend on the United States on in other words they can call call the bluff and maybe very conspicuously uh have uh meetings with China and uh it's as if ultimately uh Mexico would be uh joining the bricks and if Mexico can do it think of Latin America who have uh the United States has uh imposed military dictatorships to prevent Land Reform uh and prevent Latin American agriculture from growing its own crops in competition with us grain and to grow Plantation crops uh Latin America can uh fight the same uh fight against the large land owners that M fought against to create Chinese agriculture that all of a sudden if once you uh realize that uh you don't have to be a subordinate member of the American Empire then uh you all all of a sudden you can calculate what your actual self-interests are and uh what you want uh I know a lot of your listeners are not Americans in baseball but the metaphor that I'd find would be the New York Yankees the New York Yankees had a blustering uh owner uh Stein brener uh who owned it and uh he worked headed a Consortium with what the Yankees and got very very uh from and uh he would keep doing uh spontaneous idiosyncratic things very much like Donald Trump they're like uh very very similar and one of the partners who maybe had a 10% share my chair said there's nothing more limited than being a limited partner with Stein Berner and the Yankees well there's nothing more limited than Europe or Russia or any other country trying to be a limited partner with the American Yankees uh and I think that there's a perception of that and they're realizing uh if we want our self-determination I it's not only that other countries in the bricks are saying we want to make our own policies we don't want us diplomats to weaponize World Trade and investment to serve the us we want to Ser develop our own policies what if America's allies said the same thing we're in the same fight we want to do our policies and the fact is that uh we made an awful mistake in cutting off Russian gas that uh it was America that weaponized the gas trade by saying buy from us at four times the price you're charging Russia that uh Russia is supplying you uh with well uh we're in the same situation people for the first time uh Europe could get its independence that it was manipulated into giving up largely with uh British uh acting as the US py in 1944 1945 uh Europe can say we we we don't have to be part of the anglo-american uh uh neocon plan anymore I think gradually you're going to say some kind of sanity uh emerge along these very lines and uh I think when uh Richard describes the breakup of the American Empire in the way he has you can see how the strategy that the Americans are using is catalyzing the breakup by creating such a reaction abroad that other countries realize there is an alternative for the first time they're thinking of the alternative and as Richard pointed out this is not being discussed in the popular press but it's being discussed right here on this show you know I'm tempted uh because you know I do this from time to time so I'm tempted to quote Hegel the German philosopher who taught us about contradictions and opposites here's a rule that comes out of it and he may have talked about it himself I just don't remember at the moment but the way you function as a hemon is by never functioning like a hamon in other words the United States's position as dominant depended on never weaponizing that situation because what that does is provoke in the people you control the need to get out from under your control and therefore it negates itself what you see now is the United States as hamon doing the weaponizing and the fighting and that is the contradiction it can't do that that's not how you preserve your hegemonic status you have to be able legitimately to manage it all it's like a government that suddenly represents only these 20% of your people yeah but then the other 80% feel abandoned and your days are numbered you've just violated the rule of what a hamon has to do everyone in Mexico and Canada had agreed that of course we are overwhelmingly dependent on our huge neighbor the US now everybody in those countries is discussing how the hell do we get out of this this is not a dependency we can risk wow that's the end I don't know what what way out they will find but boy starting at the top their leaders are discovering I got to get a way out of this otherwise my career is gone and eight million other Canadians are trying to figure that out if there if the US is an export Market if the US is an import input source or whatever Trudeau in his speech thanked Canadians who had changed their holiday plans and were no longer going to visit friends and relatives in the United States but we finding other places to go and take their Vaca this is very very bad for the United States just 12 ways that that's terrible you know none of which are discussed here as if we wide over all of that it it you can't cannibalize your own allies it it is just wow and I'm wondering as a logical question the efforts of the Chinese to find Partners in Europe has been going on for quite a while and they found some my guess is they're going to find a lot more a lot more experimenting is going to be done below the surface or even publicly in which this or that entity finding itself in a tough spot in Norway or in Portugal is going to be approached by Chinese investors Chinese companies Chinese diplomats who will offer them a deal they cannot afford not to take and there it is you know step byep step the United States policy was to isolate Russia and China the end result they've isolated the US well Michael Richard pointed out the role of the narrative in all this and uh the fact that uh somehow uh the Canadians and Europeans have been you know following this false narrative not in the last week with all of uh Trump's attacks on on the aid and the state department all of a sudden we find how Aid has been financing all of the major media Publications throughout the world and they've turned reporters into um essentially just U passing on the uh talking points of the CIA and the state department all of this uh created artificial narrative coming from the neocons have suddenly been exposed all over the newspapers they're all talking about what Politico has been funded uh the uh the talk shows uh the internet shows the newspapers uh the New York Times that uh what we thought was the news for the last 50 years has all been part of the fictitious narrative to uh pre distrect people from talking about what uh you and Richard and I have been talking about on this show now uh for quite a while all of this is now out in the open and uh now all of a sudden this is opened the path for a new narrative to discuss the very points that we're discussing and that is what's going to lead people to suddenly think wait a minute we've been living in a tunnel vision describing all of this uh we don't have to fight China we don't have to fight Russia there can be a world where we all gain together if we just don't have the United States grab the whole pot for itself that that's the transformation of the narrative goes part and parcel with the transformation of the real relationships uh and that are leading to the fall of the unipolar American contr yeah before Richard just before iing up do do you want to add something yeah I I want to put it in context I I don't want to be heard of as sort of blaming the United States I understand why it sounds like that and but that is what has happened but the only model that American leadership had was the model of the British Empire we have to remember that this is a country that was part of it that lived for many many years under the British Empire's rule and that yes it had a little bit of anti-colonialism as it broke away but given the way the world worked it inherited the colonialism of the Europeans above all the British which after all was the most enormous and successful of those European Empires so we ended up in this hegelian contradiction we we espoused anticolonialism but we in fact replaced one colonialism with another and that is a very foundational contradiction and we've been playing out the lack of a recognition of this let alone a policy that would try EX at least somehow explicitly to acknowledge that and to get Beyond that we never did that so we just act out verbal anticolonialism on top of as a veneer over the actual colonialism that and nothing nothing shows this more than a sudden burst in the last month of a whole new Spurt of col we're going to take Panama we're going to take Greenland we're gonna take Canada I mean it's incredible how this surges back up out of nowhere and scares all the old EXC Colonial countries as they contemplate oh my God are we going backwards in history and the answer is that too is a typical symptom of a declining Empire and beachfront Gaza too yes I left it out my mistake my mistake another show yeah Ju Just Just before wrapping up Bloomberg and Financial Times both reported that there are two concerns on on the part of Europeans one of them is that European countries are sidelined in negotiations over Ukraine and the second part is the European officials are increasingly concerned that the United States will offload the heavy burden of postwar security and reconstruction of Ukraine onto them this is the main Richard when they Michael when they're talking about Europeans it seems that in the mind of the current Administration they don't care about what Europe feel about what does Europe feel about the situation in Ukraine because after all we know that Russia is looking for some sort of security architecture for the future of the region which Europe is part of that security architecture it's it's it's h how how can we just single out or just ignore Europe in these negotiations well Europe is working against uh everything that Trump the question is what is Europe and uh the uh European Union V Delan and the NATO leadership uh NATO really isn't the Europe that uh Richard and I are talking about we're talking about in industry labor the wage earners the population not the narrow uh layer of NATO and the captive uh Aid functioned uh Finance press uh in in Europe so uh the uh Europe itself has been hijacked by NATO and by uh the American Mighty worldlet the propaganda machine that's been taken over so so uh the question is when will Europe ReDiscover what it means to be Europe in in a way that is not a US satellite yeah also I I let me just add I know this may be disturbing but um I listen carefully to to what the Russians say and and they and they say what you say Nema we're concerned about a European security architecture but to be honest I have no idea what they're talking about and I don't think they do what what does that mean a guarantee there is no guarantee everybody who's ever offered a guarantee discovered that it a certain point it wasn't a guarantee the the NAFTA that was renewed under Trump's first presidency he signed as the president he signed the treaty that he has now simply thrown aside okay I get it I'm not surprised but it said it is what it is and it says making treaties means nothing and if the person you make a treaty with gets himself into difficulty what treaty is his response there is no treaty and what are the what is it the Russians want they want a security that Europe will not attack Russia there is no such thing they don't worry about Europe rightly because right now Europe couldn't possibly attack Russia without being defeated and badly so Russia kind of knows that of course they have to sit down with the United States because that's the only serious threat they now face assuming that their alliance with China is in good shape which it seems to be so yes they sit down there's nothing to discuss with Europe I mean whatever they agree Europe will have to go along what what options does it have now it may be that you begin to have voices in Europe hopefully with political muscle that are arguing either to to end the fiction of a EUR United Europe because it isn't I mean in France the left is powerful in England there isn't a left okay these are important differences how how you going to work that out let alone uh how you deal with alternative forland in Germany which is a rising political force in an economy that whose GDP is negative is shrinking so I I don't understand I mean Europe is being thrust decide but that's the fruit of half a century of economic development that happened everywhere else more than in Europe and if you exclude Germany then way more than in Europe and Germany is now excluding itself and consequently this is a drowning part of the world that says it remember me and everybody else says remember you you're going under the waves you you're gone we can't even reach out to you anymore because irrelevant so I I think I think that what they mean and all that they could mean is some sort of way to end the war in Ukraine having made it as much more difficult for the West to intrude on Russia as they can it just to to throw a hand full of limiting things so that they are a little bit safer than they were before and then the Russian leaders from Mr Putin on down will have to Hype to their own people how much of an architecture they put in place but whatever they say it'll have the Deep abiding force that NAFTA had yeah thank you so much Rachel than Michael great pleasure as always okay we'll hold our breath as we watch what what happens to poor Europe I want to remind you my mother was born in Berlin and my father was born in the city of Mech France I've been speaking French and German since I been a kid uh I learned it before I learned English even though I was born in the United States but I didn't speak it until I was thrown into kindergarten so I I I am half a European I follow events in Europe I I love the French language I love the German culture it is sad for me to watch how poorly the capitalist system has preserved let alone built on the Europe that it inherited from feudalism yeah exactly thank you so much see you soon byebye take care bye-bye take care bye-bye
