so nice to have you back Richard Michael and let me just manage this and let's get started with the main question here that would be why is the United States not interested in putting an end to the conflict in the Middle East and in Ukraine which we know in both of these cases they're capable of doing this and before going to the answer of this question I'm going to play a clip that the foreign minister of Lebanon is talking with Christian Amur about his point of view and why they couldn't reach a ceasefire on fight on Israel I spoke with lebanon's foreign minister Abdullah buh Habib who's in Washington to meet with American officials and he joined us for his first interview since the latest escalations foreign minister welcome welcome back to the program thank you thank you things have reached a major crisis in your country since we last spoke and I want to ask you you are in the United States right now you know that several of the administration officials agree with Israel's you know ground incursion into your country what do you make of that as you're in Washington trying to get support for for a ceasefire well they also agreed uh on the you know the Biden uh macron statement that calls for a ceasefire and that calls also the implementation for 21 days ceasefire and then Mr oin would go to Lebanon and negotiate the ceasefire okay H and they told us that Mr Netanyahu agreed on this and so we also got the agreement of hisbah on that and you know what happened since then that was the day we saw you in New York I know and you were you were talking about going into the security Council for this ceasefire and barely 24 hours later the head of Hezbollah was assassinated are you saying Hassan nasrala had agreed to AAS fire just moments before he was assassinated he agreed he agreed yes yes we agreed completely Lebanon agreed to ceasefire but Consulting with with hasah the speaker Mr ber consulted with Hezbollah and we informed the Americans and the French that that what happened so and they told us and that uh Mr Netanyahu also agreed on the statement that was issued by both presidents okay well I yeah here is the question here because if you remember with the assassination of is Han while they were talking with is Han negotiating with is Han in Qatar they assassinated him and right after they reached some sort of agreement with the government in Lebanon and just Hezbollah said okay we're gonna go with that plan they assassinated him and the question right now is here why is this with the United States Michael go ahead well the United States doesn't want to se fire it wants to take over the entire near East and it wants to use Israel is the catspaw everything that's happened today was planned out just 50 years ago back in 1974 1973 and four uh I sat in on meetings uh with the man ued who became netya who's uh Chief military advisor after heading uh mosad uh and the whole strategy was uh worked out uh essentially by the defense department uh by uh neoliberals and almost in a series of stages uh that that I'll uh explain scoop Jackson is the main name to remember scoop Jackson was the ultra right-wing uh neocon who sponsored them all uh and uh he was the head of the Democratic National Committee in 1960 uh and then worked uh with military advisers I was with uh Herman Khan uh the model for Doctor Strange Love at the Hudson Institute during these years and uh I sat in on uh on meetings and I'll describe them but I want to describe how the whole strategy that led to the United States today not wanting peace wanting to take over the whole near East uh took uh took shape gradually and this was all spelled out I wrote a book about the meetings that I had uh I gave with the war college with the white house uh and various uh uh Air Force and army think tanks uh back in the 1970s the starting point for all the US strategy here was that democracies no longer Can field uh a domestic army with a military draft uh America is not in a position able to really field enough of an army to invade a country and with without invading a country you can't really take it over you can bomb it but that just is going to incite resistance but you can't take it over the Vietnam War showed that uh that uh any uh attempt at a draft would be meant by so much anti-draft resistance taking the form of an anti-war statement that uh no country that whose leaders have to be elected can never take that uh role again now it's true that America sent a small army into Iraq uh and uh there are 800 US military bases around the world but this is this wasn't a fighting Army uh it was an army of occupation uh without really much uh resistance of the kind that Ukraine is experiencing uh with Russia for instance as we're seeing there the situation in the near East is very different uh the anti-war students showed that Lyndon Johnson when uh in 1968 had to withdraw from running for election because everywhere he'd go there would be demonstrations against him to stop the war no such demonstrations are occurring today needless to say so I won't call the us or the European Union democracies uh but there's no government uh that have to be elected that uh is able to send their own soldiers into a big War and what that means is that today's uh tactics are limited to bombing not occupying countries they're limited what the Israeli forces can drop the bombs on Gaza and Hezbollah uh and try to knock out things but uh the neither the Israeli Army nor any other Army would really be able to Def to invade and try to take over a country uh in in the way that uh armies did in World War II Everything's changed now and there can't be another occupation by the United States of foreign countries so uh given today's alliances with Russia and Iran and China so this was recognized 50 years ago uh and it seemed at that time that uh the us-backed wars were going to have to be scaled down but that hasn't happened and the reason is the United States had a fullback position it was going to rely on foreign uh troops to do the fighting as propis uh instead of itself uh it it uh that was a solution to get a force well the first example uh was to create the wahhabi Jihad fighters in Afghanistan as Al-Qaeda uh and mo Jimmy Carter mobilized them uh against the secular Afghan interests and Carter Justified this by saying well yes they're Muslims but after all we all believe in God so the answer to the secular state of Afghan was wahab uh fanaticism and giads and the United States realized that uh in order to have a a an army that's willing to fight to the last member of its country the last Afghan the last Israeli the last Ukrainian uh you really need uh a a country whose spirit is one of hatred uh toward W the other uh a a spirit very different from the American and European uh spirit well binski was the Grand planner uh who did all that the the Sunni Jihad fires became America's Foreign Legion in the Middle East and uh uh it that includes uh Iraq Syria and Iran uh and also uh Muslim states going up to Russia's border uh and the the aim of the United States was oil was going to was the center of this policy that meant the United States had to uh secure the the near East and the there were two proxy armies for it on the and these two armies have fought together as allies uh down to today on the one hand the al-Qaeda jihads on the other hand their managers the Israelis uh uh hand hand in hand and uh the they've done the fighting so that the United States uh doesn't have to do it uh the foreign policy has backed uh Israel and Ukraine uh providing them with arms uh bribing their leaders of enormous sums of money uh and electronic satellite G guidance for everything they're doing but uh the United States has been able to avoid all the uh appropri uh President Biden keeps telling uh uh Netanyahu well we've just given you brand new bunker Buster bombs and huge bombs uh please drop them on your enemies but do it gently uh we we don't want you to hurt anybody when you drop by these bombs well that's the hypocrisy that it's a good cop bad cop Biden in the United States for the last 50 years has posed as a good cop criticizing the bad cops that it's been backing bad cop Isis in al-Qaeda bad cop uh Netanyahu uh but the Herman uh when all of this strategy was being put together Herman Khan's great achievement was to convince the US Empire builders that the key to achieving their control of the Middle East was to rely on Israel as its Foreign Legion and that arms length Arrangement enabled the United States to play the role as I said uh of uh the good C designating Israel to play its role and Israel was organized and supplied elra Al-Qaeda uh with uh while the United States pretends to denounce them and it's all part of a plan that's been backed by the uh the military the state department and the National Security Opera operation and that's why the state department has turned over management of us diplomacy to zionists seemingly um distinguishing Israeli behavior from us Empire Building but in a nutshell the Israelis have joined Al-Qaeda and isis's troops as America's Foreign [Music] Legion Richard can can you hear us oh Richard can you hear us I can yeah go ahead Richard now it's fading in and out okay can you hear us right now yes now I can yeah as as you were talking about the question was how why is the United States not not interested in putting an end to the conflict in the Middle East and in Ukraine and Michael was pointing out the end game of the United States in this type of behavior and what's your take right now well I think in the case of Ukraine at this point it is merely a kind of vague leftover desire to weaken Russia it isn't working very well so my guess is it'll be over pretty soon and in the case of Israel uh I think Michael is right that this is a deal the Israelis hopefully will give the Americans some kind of Leverage over what happens in the Middle East that they wouldn't have if they didn't have have Israel otherwise I do not understand why the United States allows its policies to be made by Mr Netanyahu we have the strange situation that the the people holding back Mr Netanyahu are Israelis not Americans which given that it's two different countries rather strange Americans feel more difficulty in opposing Netanyahu than Israelis do but I don't want I don't want to take away from the fact that there is a mutuality of interest in shaping the Middle East and hoping to be able to do it but I don't think this is working very well and I think my suspicion is that they are going particularly after the election to do a lot of rethinking about all of this because this is not going well yeah and Michael both yeah I can give you uh I think we can explain it more of the context uh because a after I mentioned that the US decid realized it needs foreign troops it also realized that uh there the only kind of full-scale war that a democracy could afford is atomic war uh and the problem is that that only works against uh adversaries that that can't retaliate uh but in recent years US military policy has been so aggressive that it's driven other countries to band together uh uh and back back their allies with nuclear Powers so all of the uh countries of the world now are associated uh with nuclear backups and we've discussed that before uh the result is that today's military alliances means that any attempt to use nuclear weapons is going to risk of a fullscale nuclear war that's going to destroy all the participants and the rest of the world is as well so what is it left for the United States well I think um there's only one form of non-atomic war that democracies can afford uh and that's terrorism and I think you should look at uh uh Ukraine and Israel as the terrorist alternative to Atomic War I think Andre martinov recently has explained that uh that's the alternative to Al atomic war and this Al uh unless NATO West is willing to risk atomic war which it doesn't seem to be willing to uh then terrorism is the only uh alternative left to it and that is the basis of uh the regime change uh plans that the United States has and countries bordering Russia China and other countries that it views as adversaries that's what we're seeing in Ukraine and above all in Israel as it fight against the Palestinian population in Gaza uh the whole idea of the ukrainians and Israelis is to bomb civilians not military targets not uh uh but uh civilians uh it's a fight literally to destroy the population under an ideology of genocide and uh that that is absolutely Central it's not a it's not an accident it's built in built into the program uh and Le Lebanon even though it's largely Christian uh is is is part of that so uh the other uh weapon that the United stat States has is economic and that's uh oil and grain it was decided way back in 19734 that was right the time of the oil war war when oil prices were quad duped uh and in response to the United States quadrupling its grain prices so the United States said well if we don't the way to avoid a war terrorism and regime change is just to starve countries into submission either by not cutting off their food supply or cutting off their oil supply uh because without oil how can they run their industry uh Heat their homes and uh produce electricity uh for it it's and oil is the largest private sector Monopoly in the country uh the Seven Sisters uh controlled the oil trade ever since World War I uh and the United States has been and England have been their coordinator uh and uh after the oil War uh Saudi Arabia uh promised that what it sort of was told you can raise your oil prices as much as you want but you have to keep all of your export ear earnings in the United States you can buy treasury bills you can buy corporate bonds you can buy stocks uh but you can't keep your well this oil wealth you cannot use more than portion of it for your own development you have to turn it over to the US financial sector so Saudi Arabia became the key uh and uh the result was the Petro dollar uh that was put into US Banks and uh uh just increased the liquidity of the whole growth of uh you uh third world debt uh that exploded in the 1970s leading to the debt crisis of the 80s uh was all of that uh and basically uh the the United States realized okay uh we're going to have uh we want to control extend control uh to conquer the near East conquer countries that have vital raw materials we want to use the World Bank uh to make sure that Global South countries don't feed themselves we'll give money for uh Plantation export crops not for food the condition of foreign Latin America and Africa being an ally of the United States was not to grow their own grain and and food but to depend on us grain exports so uh you know that's the sort of economic plan uh that goes together with the uh military plan to uh be a the organizing force of of the American Empire yeah ra let me introduce a couple of other considerations just to add to the to the stew here um it is my understanding that many forces in the American political establishment interpret the collapse of the Soviet Union in 19 8990 and 91 as the fruit of a long-term US policy that included the arms race and other mechanisms where the Soviet Union could not afford the level of military activity that the United States could afford but for political and Military reasons could not afford not to do it and so the Soviet Union tried to ride that either ore and collapsed between the demands of the nuclear arms race the cost of their occupation of Afghanistan um they couldn't do it and they scrimped here and there and they didn't fulfill quite the consumer growth plan that they had promised their people and they couldn't do it if you believe that that's what went on then you might try to understand that what they're doing with Russia now is the same policy in other words it's the again the arms race but this time not the fight in Afghanistan but the fight in Ukraine fight them there draw them out cost them a fortune and assume that they cannot manage all that they're doing and that it's much easier for you being a richer much much richer country to do this than it is for them uh and the big the big mistake here was not to understand that the Russians were acutely aware of what their shortcomings were and have worked very hard in the last 25 years not to be in that position again there's an AP aphorism in military thinking everybody fights the last war but you got to fight this one not the last one the winner of the last one thinks they found the Magic Bullet the loser of the last one realizes they have to do something different Russia is surprising Everybody by the extent of its military capability and its military preparation they're winning the war in Ukraine because of it that's a miscalculation here okay that's the first thing and I suspect I suspect that not only is Ukraine rerunning the old strategy but that they hope that by imposing a kind of arms race on the Middle East partly an arms race between Israel and the Arabs and the islamics but also arms races where they could between Shiite and Sunni remember the war Iraq and Iran by splitting them up by buying off Abu Dhabi or Dubai or all of the minations that are going on they hope that they can fund their Ally Israel and exhaust all the enemies of Israel forcing them eventually into some sort of deal with Israel and Israel has to be very very careful it needs to appease the United States to make these deals but it also has to try to make sure these deals don't work out because it wants to be the American agent in that part of the world and so my last Point here's another similarity between Israel and Ukraine Mr zalinski in the Ukraine and Mr Netanyahu in Israel have no no hope of prevailing given the odds against them the sheer numbers and let's remember Americans are not they're not understanding it is not just now that Israel is at war with Hamas whom they have not yet defeated in the Gaza and they are at war with Hezbollah on the West Bank and in Lebanon but they are at war with the hutis in Yemen and they are at war with the Iranians behind all of that and they are at War more or less with the Lebanese and then there are the Shiite militias which are very close to Iran and are very powerful in both Iraq and Syria well I got news for you that's too many enemies the htis recently showed they can send missiles into Israel my guess is all of the others I've just named either can also do that already or will soon be able to do that Israel can't fight five Wars at the same time it's a small country God knows what has happened to its economy which is effectively shut down in order to fight a war their only hope is to bring the United States in it's the only hope for Ukraine otherwise Ukraine will lose quickly and Israel will lose slowly that's how it looks to me and that's for me what governs the hysteria around trying to figure out what to do but I it leaves me also with a question why is Israel unable or unwilling to cut deals my sense is the Egyptians would cut them and my sense is many of its neighbors would would at least in principle be willing to sit down and at least try to reach some and then Israel instead of expanding geographically would go up build highrises what are you doing stealing land from Palestinian peasants what are you doing is your future agricultural don't be silly it isn't it doesn't need to be it's as if we were suddenly confronted with Luxembourg to demanding pieces of Belgium or Netherlands or France or something because they had to expand they've been perfectly happy building vertical rather than horizontal for many many many decades longer than Israel has been ConEd so what is this anyway I thought these would be you know I'm I'm trying to learn how to think about this in ways that are not constricted by the way the mainstream media handle this which is useless well Richard you've described exactly what's going on uh and you've shown the uh how fighting to the last Ukrainian is now being superseded by fighting to the last Israeli why are they doing this well the answer is if there were peace if Egypt and the other countries that you mentioned were to make a a peaceful arrangement with Israel then there'd be no war uh and with no war how could the United States take over the other countries uh in the region the US policy as I said 50 years ago and I'll go into that more now was based on the US actually taking over uh all of these countries you again using Israel as the uh as the battering ram uh as what the Army uh called America's landed aircraft carrier there well the uh all this began to take place in uh the 1960s uh with Henry Jackson uh isra initially Israel didn't really play a role in the US plan uh Jackson simply hated communism he hated the Russians uh and he had got a lot of support within the Democratic party uh he was a senator from Washington State uh and that was the center of uh military industrial complex uh he was called nicknamed the senator from Boeing for his support for the military industrial complex and uh uh that's uh uh the military industrial complex backed him for becoming chair of the Democratic National Committee well he was backed by Herman Khan as I said the model for drct Strange Love uh who uh became uh the key strategist for US military hegemony of the Hudson Institute no relation to me an ancestor discovered the river that we were both named after uh the uh had used uh the Hudson Institute and its predecessor the Rand Corporation where Herman came from is it its major long-term planner uh and I was brought in uh to discuss the dollars exchange rate and the balance of payments my field was international finance well uh Herman be uh set up the Institute to be a training ground for mosad and other Israeli agencies there were numerous mosad uh people there and I made two trips to Asia as I mentioned with uad who became as I said the head of Moos mosad so we had discussions about just what was going to happening for the long term and uh they're about just what's happening today uh Herman told me over dinner one night that the most important thing in his life was Israel and that was he said that's why he couldn't get uh military information even from us allies like Canada because he said he he wouldn't pledge allegiance to their country or even the United States wouldn't swear loyalty to any other country uh and uh he described that the the the virtue of Jackson for zionists was precisely that he was not Jewish but a defender of the dominant US military uh complex and uh an opponent of the arms uh control system that was underway uh Herman Jackson was fighting all the arms control said we've got to have war and uh the and he proceeded to stuff the state department and other US Agencies with neocons who planned from the beginning uh for a a permanent worldwide war and this takeover of government policy was led by uh Jackson's former Senate AIDS these Senate AIDS were Paul wolovitz Richard Pearl Douglas FEI uh and others who uh were uh catapulted into the commanding Heights of the state department and more recently the National Security Council the Jackson vanic Amendment to the US trade Act of 1974 became the model for subsequent sanctions against the Soviet Union claiming that the claim was it it uh limited Jewish immigration and other human rights so uh right then the the state department realized here here is is a group of people who we can use as the theoreticians and the executiv of the US policy that we want they both want to take over all of the Arab countries uh on one occasion I brought my mentor uh Terence McCarthy to the Hudson Institute to uh talk about uh the Islamic world view and every two sentences is Uzi would interrupt that no no we've got to kill them all uh we've got and uh other people members of The Institute were also just talking continually about uh killing Arabs the I don't think there were any uh non-jewish Americans that had that visceral hatred of Islam that uh the zionists had or also the visceral hatred of Russia uh specifically for its anti-Semitism of past centuries most of which was in Ukraine and KV by the way well that was 50 years ago and these sanctions that Jackson uh introduced the US trade uh became the prototypes for today's sanctions against all the countries that the neocons viewed as adversaries Joe liberman uh was in the tradition of the Jackson Democrats uh the word for them uh the pro Zionist Cold War Hawks uh with this hatred of Russia and uh that made uh Israel uh the uh the cpaw for these cold Warriors they were completely different from uh most of my Jewish friends who I grew up with uh in the 50s uh the Jew Jewish population that I knew were all assimilated they were uh successful middle class people that was not true of the people Jackson brought in uh they did not want to be assimilated and uh they said just just what Netanyahu said earlier this year that the enemy of Zionism are the secular Jews who want to assimilate you can't have both there's now uh this pal policy of the 1970s has split Judaism into these two camps assimilationists who were uh for peace and the cold Warriors who were for War and the cold warriors were nurtured and financed by the United States the uh uh the defense department gave uh a big Grant of over hundred million to the Jackson Institute uh to help work out uh essentially race hatred military policies to use to Spur this anti- Islamic hatred uh throughout the near East it it it's not a pretty site all that's been uh uh there are not many people around today uh that were there then and remember how all of this uh uh was occurring but what we're seeing is as I said a charade that somehow uh what Israel is doing is all netanyahu's fault all the fault of the neocons there and yet uh from the very beginning uh they were promoted supported with huge amounts of money all of the bombs they needed all the armaments they needed all the funding they needed and Israel uh is a country whose economy needs Foreign Exchange in order to keep its current solvent uh all of that was given to them precisely to do exactly what they're doing today so uh when Biden pretends to say can't there be two-state solution no there can't be a two-state solution because uh the not nyaho is said we hate people who we hate the gazans we hate the Palestinians we hate the Arabs there cannot be uh a two-state solution and here's my map before the United Nations here's Israel no one who's not Jewish in Israel we're a Jewish State comes right out and says it this could not have been said explicitly 50 years ago that would have been shocking but it it uh it was it was being said by The neocons Who were brought in from the beginning to do exactly what they're doing today to act as America's proxy to uh to conquer the oil producing countries and uh make it part of Greater Israel as much of a satellite of the United States that England or Germany uh or Japan uh have have become uh the idea that they will continue the US policy U receive all the support they need and that's become a precondition for their own solvency that as Richard has just said uh looks like it's not working anymore uh it is insolvent there's no solution to uh uh the the black hole that Israel's painted itself into uh and yet there's no willingness to have a single state because Biden and the de and the uh entire National Security Council Congress and uh the the military and especially the military industrial complex says there cannot be any uh common uh living uh between uh Palestinians and uh je Israelis anymore than you there can be in Ukraine ukrainians and speakers and Russian speakers in the same country it's it's exactly the same it's following exactly the same policy and all of this was planned and sponsored by the United States and funded with enormous amounts of money yeah Richard yeah let's take a look at this from the Israeli Zionist perspective because you know it takes two to tango whatever the American goals were they also have to somehow mesh with what the Israelis at least those in power are trying to do or else it doesn't work put yourself in the position of a Zionist you've left the European Asian Origins you've left and you've resettled thanks to the balur Declaration and the British imperialists they gave you other people's land there in the in the excuse me in the Middle East in Palestine fundamental recognition the independent existence of a state of Israel is fragile it is logical to understand if you're a Zionist that given the disagreement of large numbers of Jews around the world with the whole idea of a country and the fact that the majority of Jews of the world didn't go to Israel even when they could have they know that their support from the rest of the Jewish Community is mixed they also know that the only country that could sustain them that they could rely on after the war of in Europe second world war was the United States it was certainly the one they would want to rely on because it came out of the war basically richer than it went in with no competitor well why would you choose England even if it were possible England or France uh if you could have the United States so that that was out okay now they have to worry and I believe they do deeply that sooner or later the United States for its own reasons will realize that the better bet for the future is on the Arabs not the Israelis cuz the Arabs are many and the Israelis are few and the wealth gap between them is not working in Israel's favor it's going the other way a few weeks ago I learned about a meeting that was held not so long ago in Beijing the Chinese Government invited all of the factions involved in the pal Palestinian movement to send representatives for a meeting to unite them all that included Hamas Hezbollah and a whole bunch of others and they had those meetings in the sponsorship of China that's got to worry Mr Netanyahu that's got to worry him a lot why not because of some fanciful notion that the Chinese would enter they're not going to do that but that the Chinese in their complicated negotiation with the United States will eventually come to agreements by sacrificing somebody else and getting along with each other that way how do I know it because it's the subtext of half of Europe's anxiety that Europe will be the Fall Guy that Europe will be carved up in the interests of the United States and China much as Europe carved up Africa in the interests of its conflicts so now the Israelis desperately need what they need an ongoing economic political and Military Support from the United States and they will be willing to do anything and everything to secure it if you remember not that many years ago there were heavy rumors that the Iran Contra Scandal was brokered by Israelis that secret supports for the aparte regime in South Africa was coming from Israel recently there was a claim I don't know if it's true that the Russians uh discovered a Israeli um mercenary operation within the Ukrainian Army okay I'm not surprised at any of that that's what a country like Israel offers it'll be the bad guy it will say the unsayable it will advocate for the United States it will take the heat including the Rage of the Arab world and the Rage of the is Islamic world because if it weren't focused on Israel where the hell do you think it would be focused here 911 happened here it was celebrated around the Islamic world for that reason so there's a there's what the french would call a marage theen they there's a marriage of convenience here between The zionists Who feel that they are dependent on the United States and they are that's why their major pushed diplomatically in the United States of their personnel is not in the Jewish Community they don't get the support they want it's in the Evangelical Community they found that scriptural arrangement in which when Jesus returns he has to find the Jews in charge of the Holy Land oh good the Jews discovered that in that new testament story they could build an alliance the biggest festivals every year of Israeli films are held in mega churches of the Protestant faith in this country not in synagogues what the hell is going on the the Israelis are desperate to have support here and they're constantly frightened the very evangelicals who they counted on are going more towards Trump and they're worried about that right it's see the irony the Jews go more the other way the Jews seem more interested in helping Ukraine the secular the non zionists so this is this is a a constantly shifting scenario but my guess is and and Michael maybe you know about this my guess is that there are voices no matter how strong uh Henry Jackson was or his progeny have become that there are are also voices pretty high up that keep wondering out loud whether the United States isn't betting on the wrong horse in the Middle East and whether maybe maybe there's someone you can find to do the job better than the Israeli zionists the minute that happens Mr Netanyahu disappears and the person who worries a lot about that is Mr and Mrs Netanyahu yeah well you described exactly the Dynamics uh that are work and uh uh for the last few weeks Nima has had uh uh numerous guests on who've been explaining that uh uh the opponents of all this are the US military because every war game according to his guests uh uh this been done uh the US loses in the near East every war game that it does in uh Ukraine against Russia the US loses so obviously there is a opposition uh right now between the Army the we'll call them the realists who say that uh if you have if if you really want to extend the war U it's not going to work but against them are as you point out uh not only a logic of the American Empire but a fat a a virtual religion uh a religion of hatred uh Zionism has been christianized uh it's it's accepted all of the hatred of uh the the other uh that this taking place and uh US military strategists uh uh don't want to put an end to the war in Asian Ukraine because if there was an end as I said then the US uh the status C remain and the United States couldn't take over these countries as satellites uh peace would mean dependent country uh uh Iraq could be regain its independence Syria would uh Iran would be left alone to be independent uh that would not give the United States per personal direct ownership of the oil uh and if you look at the neocons uh they they had a virtual religion uh I me many at the Hudson Institute uh some of them or their fathers uh were trests and they picked up try's idea of permanent revolution that is an unfolding Revolution trosy said what began in Soviet Russia was going to spread to other countries uh Germany and the others uh but the neocons uh adopted this and said no the permanent revolution is the American Empire that's going to expand and expand nothing can stop us off for the entire world so what you have is a more or less realistic uh military if not at the top which is sort of a political appointe at least are the generals who've actually done the war games uh is realism against uh a religious fanaticism that has been backed because Fanatics are more willing to die to the last Israeli or the last Ukrainian uh than realists who look at the situation ation and uh try to do what let's say president chi in China talks about the win-win uh situation well uh already when this be this split began to occur in the 1970s I actually heard discussions of uh the idea that let's rethink World War II uh that it was really fought over what kind of socialism is there going to be after the war is it going to be national socialism Nazism or Democratic socialism emerging out of the Dynamics and self-interest of industrial capitalism well uh much of the government was backing from the from 1945 the minute of a piece the American government began supporting na Nazism uh we've talked before about this government recruited uh Nazi leaders and uh put them uh if not in America throughout Latin America to fight the Communists um as soon as the United States decided uh we've got to destroy uh the Soviet Union uh they found the Nazis to be the fighters who are willing to die for their belief not sit and thinking is what I'm doing rational is it is it going to work work but not so uh one of the problems with Israel is just as Richard has discussed it's not it's not taking a path that is going to lead to the survival of Israel as an economic State uh it's already been put on rations by uh the United States uh economically financially and militarily just as England was put on rations after World War II and all of uh Europe was put on rations after World War I trosky wrote a article America and Europe and said America's put Europe on on rations uh right around 1921 uh he wrote that so again uh you could say that the Nazi spirit is one the spirit of trying to extend an Empire by uh it's us or them it's a spirit of uh of hatred uh and a spirit of terrorism uh personally by assassination and anti- uh and war crimes is the alternative to well to atomic war the Americans realize well we really don't want atom War but uh we can come as close as we can to it by terrorism and uh that's why the United States today is backing an openly Nazi regime in Ukraine and similar uh terrorist ethic in Israel to make uh essentially West Asia part of Greater Israel uh uh o over time that it's a mentality and almost a a religious war that we're in again let me EXT extended a little bit and let me pick up on something you said Michael earlier at the beginning uh which I I agree with that the anxiety in the United States is a long drawn out land War uh for fear that the American population will not tolerate it Beyond a few months or some something like that well the Israelis can't survive where they are without these military explosion I mean we've had the the Y kipur War you know the 67 War the the 73 I mean we we keep having Wars every one of which is Justified at least on the Israeli side by the need for peace and security which clearly the these wars do not secure and so they have another one and now they have the biggest and the worst one ever and why is there any reason to believe it's not going to continue and what are they doing about it well they're widening the war they're making it they're doing much more terrible destruction in Gaza and now they're widening it to to Hezbollah and to the to Yemen they're bombing and and and all of that okay the the only way they can not be producing their own demise literally organizing the cooperation first among all the Shiite communities and then eventually beyond that with the Sunni and the broader Islamic communities their only hope is in that eventuality to bring the United States in as I've said just like Mr zalinski has no hope unless he brings the even this latest business business with getting the uh the author authority to send missiles deep into Russia that's not going to work either the Russians have hidden those uh their missiles or moved them further away so they can't be reached uh so there's nothing left there is nothing left but to bring the United States in and yet your argument is the United States looks at that situation and says we can't do that it's not that we don't have missiles we do it's not that we can't do much damage we can but we can't make a quick winning of this war Lord knows we couldn't do it in the poorest countries on Earth like Afghanistan and Vietnam we sure as hell are not going to do it in Europe or for that matter in the Middle East which means that the only success of the Israelis is to bring the US in and the US can't go in because of the constraints it feels and that means at some point something's got to give here and wouldn't the logical thing be to expect that the United States will have a an epiphany moment in which it decides that Arabs are better allies for us than Israelis and that if that requires purging the highest levels of government of neocons well we know after World War II they know how to purge if they want to purge they can do that they can go after them as Jews if that's it or as zionists or as mistaken advisor there's lots of ways of doing it um it's just a decision has to be made and maybe I think if that's what I heard you say the obvious hesitancy of Lloyd Austin to to authorize anything to almost openly now be a voice saying don't don't go there don't do that to his fellow advisers of Mr Biden suggests that maybe we have a point in what we're saying here well you said it wonderfully Richard that's exactly the point what does it mean to bring the United States in uh we it's not going to send troops because you can just imagine how that American troops uh either in Ukraine or in Israel uh were just many of them would die you can imagine what that would do to the Democratic Administration that uh would be sending it uh there so they can't do that uh they've tried terrorism and the result of terrorism is to align the whole of the world uh against us is but still we're in a pre-revolutionary situation uh the rest of the world uh is appalled by the terrorism that it seems by the breaking of all of the rules of uh war and roles of civilization that the United Nations uh wrote into its uh original articles of agreement uh and is not following so what you're seeing is a whole breakdown of the ability of the rest of the world to uh enforce civilization and uh uh you're of course the hope of you and me is that somehow there would be uh right thinking people uh in the US government uh I don't see many people uh in in Congress are supporting the candidacy of uh Jill Stein who's against the War I I don't see Congress uh being reasonable I don't I think that the state department and the National Security Agency and the Democratic party leadership uh with its basis in the military industrial complex uh is uh uh absolutely committed to uh if we can't have our way then uh who wants to live in such a world well you remember how uh President Putin when threatened with American atomic war uh and people were saying well would would Russia really retaliate atomically and uh what Putin said was well who wants to live in a world without Russia after all well the newon and the Senate and the House of Representative and the president and the press and the campaign donors to both parties say well who wants to live in a world where we can't control who wants to live in a world where other countries are independent where they have their own policy who who wants to live in a world where uh we can't siphon off their economic surplus for us if we can't take everything and dominate the world well who wants to live in that kind of a world that's the mentality uh we're dealing with and uh uh I'm watching what uh uh China uh is doing and uh uh Iran is doing and they they kept hoping for instance in two days ago when Iran uh sent missiles against uh one of the airfields in Israel that had the f-16s and uh other airplanes it it let the United States know and warn Israel that uh Iran's going to blow up your Airfield you better get all the airplanes in the air well Iran said oh we don't want to upset anybody can't we just show them you know uh that a war doesn't make sense well and then now there's an argument in Israel saying wait a minute these airplanes that you didn't blow up are now going to be flying over Iran and dropping bombs on us uh the the country that does the first strike is going to get an advantage we had a chance to wipe out the Air Force so they could stop bombing Lebanon stop bombing Gaza Strip uh and uh other other countries and sto bombing us and we didn't do it uh because we wanted to keep showing the world that we're the good guys well it's like you're a good guy naked walking right up against the Nazi tanks that are coming right at you in World War I or today in uh uh in in the Ukraine that that's really the problem if the United States if we're right then why isn't or are we missing it where's the evidence that the United States understands it's being pulled in a direction it really doesn't want to go Ju Just to pick up on your last Point Michael just hear me out for a minute the United States under understands let's suppose they understand it the way you do that they got the notification and I picked up on that too that the Iranians told the United States um beforehand that they were going to do it giving them the time to let the Israelis uh know okay where are the Americans who are saying they did us a service because had they not had they not had they wrecked the Israeli um Air Force or whatever then the Israelis would have come to us requiring us to give them even more immediate massive support and this isn't good this is dangerous The Next Step will be for the Iranians to Target us look the htis who are if I understand correctly uh supported by Iran have been rocket missil American warships okay it's getting close it's getting close that you're drawn in and then your own internal politics will make you respond and then you're in and then the the Israelis have won they've got you in there and now it has its own logic its own escalatory mechanisms and you've got what everybody thought you were committed never to do a land war in Asia that cost you your own troops every president after Vietnam said they would never do that again there were some who even said it after Korea because they understood so I I would be more comfortable that we're on to something if I could see some sign that there are American voices that sense one or another version of this that we could point to well I think there has been a change of Consciousness but it's been mainly on the uh uh the Arab and Persian side uh I think that theyve uh now that they didn't shoot down the airplanes now think the Iranians are saying No More Mr Nice Guy uh they've made it clear that uh exactly what they can do to retaliate they've said that uh if Israel uh tries to attack them or if the United States tries to attack them they're going to wipe out the American military bases in Iraq and Syria which they've already shown they can pinpoint and do uh very well uh I think what Iran is in their mind what they've achieved is showing the rest of the world saying the United States is trying to been trying to go us into war uh for the last half year just as the United States has been trying to go Russia into war uh in Ukraine and uh Putin has been able to resist that because he's the longer he takes he's winning the war Europe is being pulled apart well similarly uh the Iranians can say uh the United States would have attacked us and said we're only defending the poor little Israel uh for this uh because of the Iranian attack but now that the Iranians did the attack without killing civilians without first of all only bombing the military sites whereas the whereas Israeli wants to kill people they want to kill Arabs because they hate them uh the uh uh Iranians only hit military sites not of the population so now there's no question I think that the whole rest of the world China Russia the global South the global majority is not going to fall it has deprived the United States military and state department from the ability to claim that they are responding to Iran's unprovoked attack on Israel and uh to the Gaza uh unprovoked attack on Israel uh that after uh 100,000 gazans were killed uh a few uh Israelis were killed uh and like uh Russia's unprovoked attack on uh the ukrainians who were uh killing the uh civilians in luhansk and donet uh they've deprived the United States of any pretense of do of having any uh ideology or foreign policy besides terrorism and destruction and violating every civilized rule of war that has underlined international law uh for the last few few centuries so the United States is in a war against civilization and the rest of the world is realizing that uh and so you're right where is the uh voice in the United States uh saying what you and I are saying why somebody like us uh in a position of authority well uh we're on NE of the show not in the New York Times or the Wall Street Journal uh we don't have any money coming to us from uh the military industrial complex from the non-government organizations that the state department and the National Endowment for democracy fund uh we're by ourselves and people who think like that uh find themselves obliged to resign from the state department uh resigned from the CIA uh like uh McGovern uh re resign from the Army uh like uh the guests that neas had Colonel M McGregor and uh uh Scott uh rder uh they've been excluded from the discussion that's that's the tension that the world's in today and that's what makes it so uh so uh T so violent are these people really will The Americans really uh force uh atomic war uh by saying oh we're only using tactical weapons that's really the question the Americans are uh taking a position against the the most basic principles of civilization what are other countries going to do about it are they going to realize the threat or are they going to say uh let's explain to you what your self-interest is America your self-interest is doing what Richard suggests uh work with the Arab countries work with us it's a win-win situation uh who are the Americans who with their uh donors backing them who are going to say yes we prefer saving civilization to making money this week and next week uh for living in the short term the American point of view is shortterm uh the rest of the world is taking a longer term uh position who's going to win well the irony is if if the history is any guide they will make a war and then it will drag on and then all of these arguments that we're making now will find their voices and and we'll have it you know we'll have the argument and the then the hard decisions will be made the problem is that there are many dimensions of of the United States waling itself into a dead end and and that's that has its own dangers and Dynamics when there is no uh when there is no way out if it is correct that after um Netanyahu bombed Beirut his polling numbers in Israel improved dramatically which I read they did that is a very serious fact because it means that one cannot see this as just a right-wing government doing X Y and Z one has to see a right-wing government that has been able to bring its people along with it at least so far which is what we have to say about the Democrats and Republicans in this country who have done that too uh and that's frightening because that suggests there's some more steps that they're going to be able to take and they probably will and we will be left as I have been in the last two weeks I don't mind telling you genuinely frightened about where this is going and and and how close we are coming to something unspeakably stupid and unspeakably destructive it it is the only thing that that I that I can say is that the glib disinterest in all these questions evidence by what comes out of Trump's mouth or Harris's mouth or Vance's or waltz's these people are all pretending that the PX Americana is alive and well and that you know we can talk endlessly about border incursions and and the ingestion of cats and dogs and other minor matters because the big ones aren't a problem and you and I and all three of us have just spent a long time dealing with all the other problems that they don't feel the need to talk about ever it's remarkable like noera we're sitting right here in New York underneath the bomb you know there because who wants to live in uh the world uh once it falls uh I you use the word right-wing uh and it's very humorous that uh the anti-war uh candidates in Europe are all called right-wing it used to be leftwing Austria has just had an election where the right-winger won opposing the war in Ukraine we've had three German elections the right wing is uh has won basically all three for opposing the war in Ukraine the German government is found you know their their true Nazism and said well we're going to ban uh the Le the uh afg for uh opposing the war they're calling it a right-wing government so you're having uh you're having the Nazis uh in Europe Banning the anti-war parties uh and yet there the anti-war is called right-wing and the Nazis are called de de Democrats uh and social Democrats that's what's so amazing uh the whole language uh is part of this uh uh the world being turned inside out not only that everybody is saving democracy from everybody else you know it's it's the deterioration anyway yes well I know you and I like the word oligarchy yes but but unlike you I reserve it for only in Russia they have oligarchs we have captains of industry yes so nice to come to this end and thank you so much for being with us today Richard and Michael that was so great to talk with you okay thank you also and it's a pleasure to be part of this ongoing uh three-way conversation yeah you've got to have 200,000 views of this NE by the way I don't interfere because I do find it you do talk to each other it's just perfect it doesn't need me to be there if yeah it's it's just going well thank you so much okay bye bye bye
