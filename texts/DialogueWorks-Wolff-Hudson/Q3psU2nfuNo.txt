hi everybody today is Thursday March 27th 2025 and our friends Michael Hodson and Richard W are back with us welcome back thank you Nema glad to be here let's get started with the situation in the Middle East it seems that Donald Trump is preparing for a war to put at least he he's doing everything to put pressure on Iran and he's he's preparing for that to make a new war in the Middle East he was in 2019 he mentioned that going into the Middle East is the is the worst decision ever made but right now he's the president of the United States he's talking about a new war in the Middle East how what's your take Michael on that and how is it going to influence Russia China and the whole world well I think Trump is preparing two scenarios plan A and plan B and the most obvious one that uh everybody's discussing is to show Iran that he may indeed join Israel in attacking it and uh saying how awful this will be um he always begins at the threat to hurt an adversary and then he offers not to hurt it so badly if it gives him and the United States what he wants and in this case I think what he wants in Iran if he doesn't attack it is for it to stop supporting Yemen and Hezbollah and Hamas uh in Gaza so Trump's second scenario is to obtain this in exchange for removing the sanctions that he put on uh Iran when he broke the deal that Obama uh had had made with it and pulled out of the agreement uh just in the last few days Nema the National Security Council uh has come out with its uh annual uh review and in the section in Iran it says that uh it agrees that Iran is not working on an atom bomb and hasn't been working on an atom bomb so none of this rhetoric that uh Trump and Netanyahu are saying has any basis in reality at all so why why are they saying these things uh I think that one hint that Trump is planning uh option A to attack Iran in the next few months is his increasingly hurried attempt to offer Russia what it's asking for in the negotiations uh over Ukraine and the uh uh transportation deal throughout the Black Sea i think most immediately the access to grain exports via the GL Black Sea is what uh uh Russia wants unlike uh much of the press uh reports in in America uh this excess is only for grain exports not for uh all uh other exports and especially not for arms and military uh uh uh exports by Europe into uh into Ukraine uh I think that the US strategists uh uh last time they nullified this promise by saying okay you know we agree on free trade and then immediately the uh the US neocons called up the world's insurance companies and said you know deny insurance or raised the rates to unsupportably high rates on uh on uh black sea transportation and they told Europe "Don't let uh any payments be made to Russia for this grain make sure that it's cut out of Swift." Well Trump seems now to be and all of this is connected to Iran as I'll get into all of this now Trump is saying "Well uh let's uh uh let Russia once again receive payments russian banks will be off the sanctioned list and they can uh deal with Swift in order to get the normal payments let's give Russia uh what it wants well immediately you know I thought why is he giving it i know that he wants to solve uh to get the Nobel Priest prize for uh making peace in Ukraine but why is he giving uh going overboard and giving Russia so easily what it wants and I think it's because he wants to be able to turn around and say "Well now that you have you know everything that you've wanted uh we're going to attack Iran uh in a few days." Uh and we really don't uh if you were to somehow take Iran's side and uh defend it well then of course I I couldn't possibly maintain these uh agreements that I've made with you and uh everything that we've offered you everything that you think that you uh uh we're going to get through a normal uh trusting the United States we can take away because that's our policy uh any agreement can be pulled back just like we pulled back Obama's agreement with Iran uh uh concerning the uh uh the the sanctions before so I I think he he in a way is trying to prepare uh this ground to convince Iran that it's not going to be able to get Russian support uh because he can separate uh Russia from Iran i don't think he can but that's Trump's fantasy uh in the hope that Iran then will say "Okay uh we're going to withdraw our support for uh the Houthies we're not going to uh support Lebanon and Hezbollah we're not going to support Gaza we will sort of do uh everything that the United States would want us to do if they really did bomb us uh and and take over." I think that's the fantasy that uh Trump is working on but it's a fantasy that I think his administration shares uh and that's really is the setting well the question is what's going to happen when the fantasy comes right up uh against reality well it when uh Russia says "I'm sorry Iran is our partner and we don't double cross our partners." That's what you do we're different uh we have a different strategy uh for Russia iran survival is absolutely the key because uh beyond Ukraine is Central Asia and if I mean beyond Iran is Central Asia and if anything were to uh lead to a regime change and a restoration of the Sha or you know US proxy uh government in Iran then NATO could move right into Central Asia uh and attack Russia from uh bases in the south uh Wasbakistan uh Kazakhstan uh with its oil uh the the whole area there now it could also block China's built and road initiative that is uh supposed to run through uh central Asia so Iran is really the key to China's long-term foreign policy of the belt and road initiative to uh Russia's defense uh from attack uh against attack from the south and uh so defending Iran is an absolute need that doesn't mean that Iran uh or or Russia would oppose Iran saying "Okay we're not going to provide any more weapons to uh Yemen and the other countries." But what this would do would be to to to let Israel just consolidate its support its control over the near east unless Erdogon in Turkey tries to confront the uh the ISIS uh regime that uh the Israelis and the United States have installed there uh the if there is a war uh and there are hostilities Europe would be the immediate victim because Iran has always said uh if under attack its first response is going to be to sink a ship in the straight of Hormuz and block the Suez Canal trade in oil and uh it sort of dropped hence that in the past before it had signed the friendship group with Saudi Arabia uh it could even uh block the uh Saudi uh oil export uh ports one way or another the price of oil would soar uh Europe would suffer russia would be the main beneficiary that's what makes all this so uh ironic and uh it it's what makes the US tunnel vision strategy uh so self-destructive if it really wants only to back Israel uh it's going to uh lose the whole cold war plan that it's uh it's outlined that's that's my view of the big picture go ahead yeah let me just add a few things i think that uh Michael has laid out much of what what's going on here i would add that one of the basic platforms of Mr trump that enabled him to win was that he would not persist in what I believe uh has now been coined as quote unquote the forever wars in other words he attacked uh the Democrats for forever wars such as the one in Ukraine it would be a bizarre and risky thing to close out one war only then to start another one uh not even so far away from the first one and again involving Russia as a as an opponent directly or indirectly that strikes me as very dangerous uh politics whatever the importance he assigns to Israel he's not going to do that for Israel he would rather see Israel disappear and and make his uh his Gaza resort deal with maybe some Palestinians if he could find them i don't I don't see it i really don't see it um there are many reasons for him not to do this not the least of which is the fact that he is now under increasing difficulty at home i I think this now needs to be factored into the equation it's only a few months but it seems as though the November election victory Yeah Richard it seems that we've lost the connection with Richard michael you're frozen Richard frozen and silent yeah there is something going on with his connection yeah I should say there's a problem with what Richard and I both say what we're analyzing is uh what is reasonable to happen we're analyzing what uh happens if the United States Europe Russia and Iran act in their self-interest but we're dealing with not only with uh these actors not acting in their self-interest i don't know whether they even know what their self-interest is that's the problem how can you be reasonable in analyzing the behavior of unreasonable people that's really the problem michael in the new leaks of the Trump administration's officials in which they were talking about if they attack Yemen what would be the what would be the outcome of these sort of attacks jd Van said that the interest of Europeans in the in in the Red Sea is much more than those of us and we we are not that much dependent on the Red Sea it's it's all about Europeans do you think that in their sort of analysis they're going to bring European in into the conflict even much more than before and that would be the main reason to put pressure on them to bring them into the conflict i think they're too unreasonable for pressure to be on them the question is who is them the European what is called the Europeans are two crazy women who have a uh almost psychopathic hatred of Russia vanderlan and Kayak Kalis the Estonian uh lady so uh if the Europeans are the head of the European uh union uh they're not the Europeans at all they're US uh appointed NATO people in charge of uh of Europe so uh the European populace uh may uh be completely against the war there what do they want they want lower energy prices again they they they want to heat their homes and uh do cooking uh the industrialists want uh uh oil and gas and they don't want to have to close down their uh their companies uh but uh the uh the the EU the two European uh neocons with the EU don't care about any of this and as Enolina Burbach said of the Greens we don't care what the voters say this is uh this is destiny to fight Russia to the uh absolutely to sacrifice everything to fight Russia so uh again we're not dealing with reasonable self-interest or even the ability of Europe to make any kind of uh agreement with uh Trump right now especially given all the strains of the tariff uh the strains over uh Europe's desire to throw a monkey wrench into uh Trump's negotiations with Russia uh glad you're back uh Richard yes I'm very sorry i do not know what happened all the computers in the building where I'm sitting went off and now they have come back but it is as usual one of the great mysteries you know in the middle ages they worried about the mysteries of the church we met we worry about the mysteries of the internet so it bizarre shall I continue where I left yeah go ahead yeah yeah i wanted just to make the point that the level of chaos and trouble and opposition is building and quite quickly by American standards uh the the latest effort the the the the the tariffs against Canada and Mexico adding a whole another layer of trouble and difficulty and uncertainty to all the others that have been added on you know there are demonstrations around the country uh the collapse of Mr musk's position his reputation uh the the shares the value of Tesla collapsing around him suddenly Americans are talking about the BYD corporation in China about which most Americans had never heard a word now suddenly as they become a bigger phenomena in the auto market than Tesla this has to be dealt with and suddenly Americans are discovering that there's a 100% tariff against those cars which is the reason you don't see them and they're beginning to re to learn a little bit about tariffs because they don't know anything you know for example the American love of the pickup truck that is a feature of tariffs it's not that he men like a truck they learned to like a truck in the 1960s when the United States imposed a tariff against pickup trucks brought in from Europe which were taking the market those were blocked and by the way that tariff has been in existence the entirety of the last half century of the United States we've protected it and you can therefore can do prices of pickup trucks much higher relative to their cost than you can with a con sedan car and that's why it was important to have a He-Man standing next to his pickup truck to get American men to think there's something sexy about having a pickup truck that's not a culture that's a cultural artifact brought into being because it's profitable which it was made by means of a tariff there's nothing new here well I don't want to have the conversation now although I think it's very valuable to do my point is simply there's an enormous growing upset about a whole lot of issues they will be made even worse in my judgment by continuing the forever wars by literally starting a new one when you've barely finished or maybe haven't even finished the old one this this will allow the Democrats to say the usual nonsense that each party that's out of office says against the one that's in office um I don't think he's going to do that i don't think it's worth it uh especially if Michael is right and that by threatening as usual you can work out some in between that will make it look as though the threat was terribly effective mr trump can be more peacemaker which I think right now is more his political objective certainly by what he did with the Black Sea deal he seems to have been willing to cut he wants it it's very clear around the world that's certainly the interpretation that Mr trump wants a deal and is willing to give the Russians everything and if you pick up today's European papers you will see the uh the renewed outrage of Starmer and Macron and the others who don't want to see what it is they're seeing and so their even crazier fantasy that they are going to control any of this is already on display there's a conference in Paris of of countries uh Mr starmer has announced again that they're going to have these military uh forces that they're going to put into Ukraine i mean they they are they are really desperate looking like it i don't think this charade is going to last much longer and if they're dumb enough to actually do any of this they're going to see in their own countries an opposition that is going to put all of them on notice that their political careers may soon be over well what you say Richard is relevant to the question that uh Nema asked while you were you were off the air he said "You know what what role does Europe play in this uh triangular US Iran Russia deal?" And uh the uh you were right to bring up tariffs uh because uh when uh yesterday Trump said yes the 20% tariffs are going to go against European autos uh the Europeans said "All right we're going to increase tariffs especially against uh Musk's uh cars his electric vehicles." He's they're targeting Musk specifically and I think uh if Europe then opposes uh tries to uh counter Trump's act by saying "All right we're going to let in uh the Chinese cars and trucks uh then uh you're going you're going to have the eve of Trump's decision do I attack Iran or not be well how do I pull Europe in?" and uh the points that you've made of disagreement between Europe and America especially uh uh the European uh Macron and uh Starmer saying we are going to prevent any peace deal with uh with Russia because we're going to have our own troops there and we're going to put our own missiles there and we're going to attack Russia uh to make sure that there cannot be any agreement until uh r Russia uh is basically destroyed and Ukraine uh recovers the uh areas that uh of Russian speakers so that it can kill them all uh this is uh this is the craziness uh uh that's at work and I think it makes it almost impossible to get all of these people uh in an agreement trump's going to say "Well what can I do now uh now that Europe is having counterveailing duties against America including American whiskey and the other things they've talked about?" uh he's going to up the ante and he's going to try to hurt them and all of a sudden his uh retaliation and resentment is going to uh make it almost impossible for there to uh to be an agreement between uh Europe and America as it is between Russia and Ukraine so uh this is going uh this the good news for that is it makes uh very difficult to imagine any real attack on Ukraine given the fact that America is not going to be able to get much European support for uh the uh uh for an attack on uh on Iran uh and uh that Iran will uh uh realize this and uh can say well you know we're uh we're really not uh responsible for uh the Houthies they're independent people uh there's nothing we can do uh to stop them you know we're uh we'll be nicer that's about it uh uh oh yeah we've lost Richard again uhhuh well anyway that's Michael when you look at the United States there there are people who are arguing that the United States in terms of the economy is self-sufficient and is not that much dependent on the situation in the Middle East if something big happens between the United States and Iran a big war and do you think that the United States is going to be is not going to be that much influenced by the war it's going to be just the European Union gonna hit the war going to hit the European Union no the United States is not self-sufficient uh nor is Europe uh uh Europe has uh hardly anything to offer europe's lack of self-sufficiency is going to spill over to uh demands for the United States to saying you you uh we went along with you destroying uh our uh energy economy and our trade with Russia and our trade with China but uh now that you've destroyed our trade uh with the Near East and our access to oil we don't have any way uh of of uh of surviving this will lead uh this cannot help but lead to a break between Europe and America and America certainly is dependent on uh on many imports not only of its industrial goods but uh for the raw materials that China has threatened to sanction uh and that Russia has already sanctioned against uh to the United States and if you take uh what makes America especially not self-sufficient is Trump has uh interrupted the supply lines first of all to the automotive industry uh he says well now that the uh General Motors and the oil the auto companies can't get their auto parts from Canada and Mexico let them build factories here nobody told them it takes more than a week to build a factory and to hire the labor for it takes a couple of years so uh yes America can rebuild its self-sufficiency probably by 2200 uh it it'll take a revolution uh to be self-sufficient so it's not it's going to have the supply chain interruptions the trade interruptions the shipping interruptions uh from the near east uh the uh the decision by Saudi Arabia and the Arab states uh what to do with uh all of their uh dollar investments in the United States uh Trump has asked Saudi Arabia for $1 trillion worth of uh a commitment to buy American arms uh even though they don't work even though they've shown to be uh irrelevant in Ukraine because uh big countries don't fight with tanks anymore uh they fight with drones they don't fight with people anymore they fight with drones and missiles uh there's no need for American arms that it makes are not relevant for the wars of the 21st century that you know probably last only half an hour anyway uh given all of the missiles so uh the uh yes it's America is not self-sufficient uh and the uh interruptions are going to uh cause uh huge dislocations that are going to raise prices uh very sharply and uh cause the stock market to go down i'm amazed the stock market didn't go down before uh when I I turned on the uh computer uh you know when I got up this morning and the Wall Street Journal had the u Dow Jones Industrial Average futures were actually up and I thought how can that be with all of the tariffs well uh certainly when I by when they opened at 9:30 New York time the they went down because of the uh uh the decline in the car company stock but only marginally only you know less than less than one point i'm amazed that the stock market seems to uh really believe that none of these disruptions are going to happen it's almost saying well if we did think that they were going to happen if we planned for it then we would be Dr doom and tell people don't invest in stocks they're all going to crash and that's not what uh companies that sell stocks uh or mutual funds that sell stocks are very eager uh so there's a a kind of pacification of the American public uh both by the media and by the the Wall Street press uh to sort of downplay all of these destru disruptions that are coming up and if you point out what the destructions are again you say "Well this is benefiting Russia this is benefiting Iran you're just trying to stop the war that we need in order to save uh uh civilization and promote democracy." So this is all of this is uh the fabric that is going to be uh suddenly torn richard we were talking about the question was is the United States self-sufficient when it comes to a bigger war in the Middle East and the the Trump administration that's why he thinks that Europeans going to get a hit by the war we're not going to be that much influenced by the war in the Middle East how what's your take on that well I don't I mean I'm not JD Vance the the reason that I'm asking this because because of the leaks of these forum that the the Trump administration's officials were talking and JD Vance mentioned the situation in the Red Sea is going to influence Europe is not that much influencing us that's why I'm asking this yeah i I mean I'm not interested in the prediction i I I'm not good at predictions i've never found anyone else very good at it either i I think there's a problem with the whole idea of it but anyway uh what I was struck by by looking at the transcripts and and and the very conversations that were leaked and that Mr trump has now branded a hoax uh the beautiful thing about it the thing I found interesting was the level of hostility to Europe i mean wow people use words like "I loathe Europe." All right that's very American america is a place where when you have a disagreement with somebody else and know maybe that's our Puritan heritage or whatever that is but there's a need to demonize right mr putin is the worst thing imaginable you know everybody is the ultimate evil stalin and Hitler you know a little guy like like Gaddafi in Libya is you know or Saddam Hussein are made into staggeringly evil the use of the word loathe or Mr advances come in why are we taking our military to worry about ships we don't use the Red Sea the Europeans do wow talk about the end of NATO that's the end of NATO there NATO is now I mean I don't know what those people over there are thinking but this is the worst condition NATO has ever been in the whole rationale of being the the the the the means to contain Russia remember George F kennan and all of that literature it's over the United States is busy cutting deals with the Russians the Europeans are left out they don't want they built their entire career around this notion of the evil danger of Russia they have excused everything they've built a political machine in most countries barely strong enough with half the people to hold back the social democratic left which has the other half of the people and the whole thing has been built around we see the left is not a reliable partner to hold back the Russians we are okay it's something united States played that card for a long time they're playing they have no other cards they're in real trouble so they hold on to the I mean if you take a step back what do we know we know that at the end of World War II which in which the Germans were finally defeated by the power of the Russians coming from the east and the power of the United States with Western Europe coming from the west and that defeated the Germans and with the defeat Europe was reorganized into what the United States and a corridor called NATO the European allies and on the other side the Soviet Union with its corridor called the Warsaw Pact Eastern Europe okay over the last 30 years NATO expanded and the Warsaw Pact disappeared all of the countries on the border of Russia were transferred over to the enemy so if anything Russia is made much more vulnerable and the West is made much much much stronger to resurrect the evil danger of Russia under these circumstances that's crazy the west is the one that won that game they took over the protective cordon that the Warsaw pact had represented they have less danger more territory russia is barely re recovered from the catastrophe of post 1990 uh difficulties in Russia yes they have a military and it's impressive i I don't question yes they are coming back but come on i mean the situation should have made the West less worried that's presumably why they worked so hard to get Poland into NATO and to get you know Romanian Bulgarian all the rest come on this is so you have to ask what in the world and now you see the United States with the final blow saying Russia's not a d we're not we don't want to deal with Russia as a danger we want to cut a deal and there's a small point here I I would not I would not overlook they now confront the United States which is going alone own Europe is in terrible trouble every way i mean look at the gas problem that looming this winter look at their energy problem look at their price structure uh Britain just downgraded its economic growth estimates for next year down to 1% or less i mean everywhere and now they're going to be hit by these tariffs here's what they're going to have now to deal with that part of their population that looks upon all of this as a failure of political leadership their social democratic left is going to cash in on that number one number two they're being frozen out as the United States wants to hold on to as much of what the Western capitalist empires can still produce in the face of China and the bricks the United States is going to grab it if you're not helping us economically said Mr trump we're going to hit you hard mr trump wants to save for this country they can't do anything about that and so there are going to be now voices inside the capitalist sector of these countries wanting themselves to cut a deal with China here's the irony of it all you're forcing where are they going to go with whom are they going to make profitable deals where will they sell their cars if they can't sell them in the US might the rest of the world might they make a deal they're going to have to look at that because they don't have many options left that's why we're in this period in which a declining empire to sort of think of Rome the collapse of Rome and suddenly everybody in Rome is beginning to pay attention to what they used to call the savage tribes out there in the hinterland the Goths the Franks all the suddenly they become important to understand these are people with a history with a culture with a religion with an army you have to take them seriously before they were undistinguishable savages before Asia was a secondary issue for Europe now it may be the only thing left to save them and they're going to have to come to terms with their own former colonial subjects who are now in the driver's seat these are the kinds of reversals that go with a declining empire which is the story that keeps returning through the details well the big question is can they come to terms with it uh is it really part of their character uh uh Secretary Lavrov gave a explanation of uh uh Russia's view uh of the West uh a week ago and uh Carl Sanchez has it on uh uh his website i want to quote what Lavrov said uh over the past 500 years when the west was more or less formed in the form in which it has survived to this day with some changes all the tragedies of the world originated in Europe or happened thanks to European politics colonization wars crusaders the Crimean war Napoleon the first world war Adolf Hitler who demands discontinuation of the bankood in the form of the war in other words uh Russia looks at uh Europe uh and the West as basing their views on on the form of uh what you'd pointed out the hatred that America has shown towards Europe and uh even in terms of uh uh juxtaposing the comments that uh Trump's cabinet recently made uh disparaging Europe uh you juxtaposed uh how Trump has indeed tried to end America's uh war with Russia so that it can fight China uh but I think there's it there's subtext to this to cut a deal is to be able to threaten to break the deal that's Trump's motus operandi and uh I I suppose that Trump is trying to make this deal with Russia only to say now that we've given you what you wanted we can take it all away if you don't uh obey American foreign policy in the near east uh and ally uh yourself with us first against Iran and then against China so you have a choice uh uh if you don't want us to break the deal you've got to break your deal with Iran and China i think that is uh basically the uh the Trump strategy and I think that uh uh Lavro has got the western strategy right he traces it all the way back to the medieval period uh when the uh Roman church sought to uh uh uh conquer southern Italy Sicily Spain the Balkans and ultimately Constantinople in its fight to uh take control of Christianity away from the uh Roman Orthodox Church in Constantinople who they considered themselves the real Romans not uh the occupants of of Rome who are taking it over and from the Russian point of view this uh fight uh over religion is is the be just typical of a whole mobilization of hatred against Russia and the east that's gone on for a whole millennium so I'm not sure that uh Germany Russia uh certainly not the EU and parliament is able to suddenly reverse its uh its policies and uh uh become reasonable you'd have to change the people involved you'd have to change the political parties involved uh uh people don't really change you replace them with a whole new group and I don't see right now in Europe the pro prospects of another new group emerging if you're looking at German politics the only group that I can see with a realistic approach such as uh uh Richard and I take and most of your guests take Nemo is the Sarah Vagnik group and uh they didn't even uh reach uh the 5% limit to get represented in uh uh in in parliament so uh this uh I Richard's absolutely right as to what is needed and what is reasonable and what is in the self-interest of Europe but I don't see Europe acting in its self-interest or being reasonable being Europeans richard let me play a clip of Lavro talking about the the way that they're seeing the relationship between Russia and other countries yeah here is what I said of comprehensive partnership and the strategic interaction with China are very productive our strategic relations with India is developing and the deepening of friendly ties with countries such as Islamic Republic of Iran and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea are flourishing yeah Richard there is no Europe in the way that he was talking about and what what's your what what's the strategy on the part of Russia do you think they're thinking of getting back to the to the west they're getting closer to the west or they're just giving up on the west and the way that the Europeans are treating them right now well I think that it's a combination the way that the West has treated them the whole experience here in the Ukraine uh situation up until now i mean that Trump has changed that but up until then uh it was sort of the classic NATO alliance uh having gotten much stronger at least in terms of its numbers you know it's always that mistake that analysts make you look at the growth of NATO you would have been very comfortable they basically not only defeated the Warsaw Pact which was their opponent but they absorbed what was left of the Warsaw Pact and so they moved everything closer to the Russian they did everything that R Soviet foreign policy and then Russian foreign policy had hoped to prevent right up to the border now is the West that's why they made their decision to say stop but why did they make it well why didn't they stop the Poland or or the Czech Republic or any of the others because they were too weak i mean to be blunt they couldn't they were still in the chaos of the post 19990 adjustment or whatever you want to call it the end of the Soviet Union and the emergence of a new system there but they tried very hard to get stronger and then the west found itself getting weaker not so much because of Russia but because of China and its own internal contradictions so there was a different balance of forces by the time they wanted to incorporate Ukraine russia was now stronger and they were in fact weaker and this new technology of war that Michael talks about very very important you know nobody can understand what happened in the world wars without understanding the mistake for example that the power of France made when it had the magnol line you remember all of that you know that proved to be useless they the old joke everybody fights this war with the last wars strategy and technology well we may be seeing a very graphic example of that being replayed as as you as you can kind of see drones are a new way of doing these sorts of things and missiles in their now multiplicity of capabilities and the ability of the Russians to apparently have one that is ahead until someone else catches up of course and if you're constantly fermenting arms races which we are and they are well then you know it's a it's a crapshoot who wins that race at any given moment and therefore wins that particular war but you have to have a bigger view than that and again Europe is in real trouble now Michael is right it would take big changes especially the way things look now for them to get out of the rut that they're in in which everything is premised on an aggressive Russia without that being the case that puts you in a very odd place if you do that the United States has been in that place for a long time and that's a a key to many of our problems we have a we we tell a story here about the evil of communism this becomes hard when the Soviet Union goes into collapses even now the hostility to China doesn't know how to theorize itself so you have the the people who have no understanding at all is the communist party because they remember the cold war and so you got to be against communist parties the Chinese have one of those so you can focus your angry but for most other people that seems irrelevant the danger is that China outproduces the United States so we have this 100% tariff against the BYD corporations electric cars why because they are the best and the cheapest in the world they've defeated the United States in the technology race in the automobile industry which is the most important reality we have until we make the transition to mass transit which of course is a much more rational way of dealing with transportation than going from the gas guzzling car to the electric car that's stupid right but that's where we are we are we are still trying to make money off of the private car for as long as we can and if that means shifting to electric all right my point the Europeans need to to chart a new direction if I may suggest it to the leftist parties in Europe that's your slogan we need the old is dead it's dead anti-communism dead anti-Russia dead alliance with the United States we need a new They haven't figured that out yet luckily the existing power haven't figured it out either all right a new one will come and then it will go and here I perhaps disagree with Michael i think it can go very quickly i think the left is institutionally stronger in Europe than it is in the United States uh in both cases half the country is open to that and that's quite similar Europe and America but organizationally the Europeans are way ahead of the Americans so I think it could happen and here's why in the 1930s and 40s here in the United States the left was able to get an extraordinary degree of popular support the Great Depression here drove the working class to the left not to the right we didn't have Hitler we didn't have Mussolini or anything like it we all We went to the left two socialists and one communist party took the American working class to the left built the CIO the labor movement together with the unions extraordinary watch social Security unemployment compensation federal jobs first minimum wage there's no comparable moment in American history and it was paid for by taxing corporations and the rich and borrowing from them okay and the president the only one in American history ever to confront an organized demand from below on that scale the president who then made it happen brought out the taxes and the borrow gets reelected three times no president had ever had that before so we had a real movement to the left and then during World War II which is the only thing got us out of that depression we were allied with the Soviet Union which meant that the ruling class here was confronted with the New Deal coalition the strongest threat from the left it ever faced that forced it to fund Social Security unemployment and all the rest of it and then allied with the Soviet Union no wonder after the war they brought in Joe McCarthy and conducted a massive purge of the left you can see it but here's my point overnight the left went from the savior of the country in a depression from the savior of the fight with fascism afterwards overnight from 1945 by 1947 they had redesigned Russia to be the greatest threat to everything decent and human and Christian and fill in the blank that didn't take very long they needed a change and they mobilized their everything they had the media the academics you know leftist professors were thrown out of their jobs uh media person come on i mean if you look at the history it's dramatic i suspect we may be in the early stages of a comparable event in Europe and not because they're copying the US but because they have no other way to go they have no ch if they don't do that they will become the opposite of what Lavro correctly said instead of being the center of the world the shaper of the world they will become a relatively unimportant corner of the world visited occasionally by tourists from the rest of the world well Richard the implications of what you're saying and what I'm saying uh over the long term is the salvation of Europe and the United States is to be more like China that's the kind of that's really what we're saying uh because what China is uh is what the United States was in the late 19th century the same protectionist idea the same uh public infrastructure spending uh that is exactly how Germany industrialized in the late 19th century uh taking with the state theory of money uh taking over the monetary system to finance industry not uh the Anglo-American approach of uh letting uh industry be financialized but financializ but uh industrializing banking uh it's how Britain got rich under the uh mercantalist period what uh Europe and America have done is erased their own history uh the it is their own history that was indeed going in the direction that you and I have described the world seeming to go through in the 20th century of industrialization and industrial capitalism leading toward socialism because of its reliance on an increasing role of government well that's the big fight uh uh today the the entire fight of neoliberalism from Margaret Thatcher and Tony Blair in London to Donald Trump and Elon Musk today is to get rid of government this is this is the the mentality that has been drilled into a generation of people that have no memory at all of their own country's history how they got rich under industrialization and the horror is to think that the country uh the one country of the world that is most successful is doing just what America Germany and England did to be uh most successful uh in times ba past there is a narrative of history uh that is at stake here and somehow we're dealing not only with what voters want but who is going to promote the narrative uh and in a way you could say that this isn't inherently either right or left it is reality versus unreality and it's a historical view of how civilization has developed and where it's going as opposed to the idea of uh uh let's uh just reinvent the world from scratch today without looking at history but looking uh at it the way the way that Trump does as a transaction that's really it's a fight of mentality more than anything else uh and I don't see the the uh the groundwork for a mentality being developed either in Europe or the United States that's what neoliberalism done has done it has wiped out the consciousness of economic history of social history uh in people so that they're not aware of what you and I have been talking about as uh what was most successful in the United States and uh uh Europe throughout the 20th century you know that helps me understand something uh that I was having trouble placing I have been struck by the ease and remember Michael and I are professional economists we've been professors of economics in my case all my adult life in Michael's case for much of it so we know the power of the whole neoliberal mentality because that's what the universities teach the politician the the the the business leader the the academic the media writer whatever they know of economics which is usually not all very much because economic literacy is is poor in the United States but what they what people do know they got from school and in school they learned that markets are a fantastic institution that in a neutral way serves everybody to get the optimum outcome they actually use words like optimum and all of that it's just it's the best thing there is upon which no improvement can be achieved they think like that the best government is the least government you can quote less a far or you quote Thomas Jefferson it doesn't matter it's it's a kind of a I've been struck though that in the Trump administration in in a relatively short time historically we now see a large part of the country very comfortable having the government intervene everywhere giving the go what is a tariff a tariff is a governmental act interfering in the free market you know blocking migration is an interference in the free choice of individuals app propo where they going to live and work you know taking Greenland or taking back the canal or making Canada the 50 these are massive government interventions in the economy announcing the other day that any country that buys oil and gas from Venezuela will be an appropriate target for tariffs that's like a secondary boycott we have laws against doing stuff like that this is remarkable I think for people look at the change it is so weird and fast that there are Democrats who don't know the history just as Mar as Michael just said there are Democrats who are beginning to line up behind neoliberalism as a counterweight to the governmental initiative taken it's role reversal republicans used to attack the Roosevelt New Deal Democrats for wanting the government to have a role you know John Kenneth Galbra and all of that so we're seeing a desperate struggle here's my point a desperate struggle inside the United States over this new switch and the irony I enjoy in the in the post-war period we went from Ka's government intervention management to a free market ideology and then Reagan and and and Thatcher and all of that but we went very quickly and the Soviet Union went from friend to enemy now we're going quickly the other direction and Russia goes from enemy to friend i mean it it the malleability suggests and I like this as a radical that the ideological commitment to neocclassical economics is very thin it's been repeated endlessly it's in the minds of the people but it is thin and hasn't settled halfway as deeply as we might have expected it to and so maybe time will tell the Europeans will show more ability to change direction and gear although I certainly agree with Michael that the current leadership is so embedded in the old that they will have to go there's no place for Starmer or Mron or Vander Laden or any of I mean that they're not quite believable listening to them now and I think their future is dim and the and the extremity of what they say and do is a sign of how desperate they really are i mean at this point they are the only ones who want the war in the Ukraine to never stop they're seriously thinking about bringing their own troops to sit and work side by side with the Ukrainians in a situation in which open war or under the cover war will be the norm for an indefinite future they can talk peace all they want but they're not making peace they're doing the opposite and I don't think many people are fooled well what I fear Richard is that uh when the uh you talk about the United States looking at Russia as a friend is in the sense that the enemy of my enemy is a friend russia is a friend only as long as Trump believes that it can turn Russia against China and against Iran and once it realizes that it can't do that that uh Russia and other countries don't change their alliances from day to day from opportunity to opportunity but once they look at the long term uh the uh Russia is going to remain a friend of China and a friend of Iran and uh that means that it will not be the enemy of my enemy and that kind of a friend and Russia will simply be added back to the enemy list as uh uh Europe is treating it now that's my fear yeah that's what look that's another one of the outcomes of of the conundrum that that we're actually in that's right that's right but these what's valuable here in this conversation is the kinds of dimensions the aspects that we talk about we're not predictors right none of us we don't know the future you know if you want to know the future go to the carnival and give that lady a few bucks and she'll tell you what your future is it's an amusement what we're trying to do is point out some of the real potentials good and bad that are percolating here right under the surface that are going to shape what goes on and let me make an appeal though to you Nema and to our audience i do think that we need constantly to go back and forth as you're doing Nema in as you design what we talk about between the international but also the class struggles inside each of these units because they each shapes the other of those two but it's the interaction between them that gives us the understanding well that's Richards and my hope the class struggle within these groups that's that's it thank you so much Michael and Richard great pleasure as always take care thank you Nema and thank you Michael talk to you soon talk to you soon bye
