hi everybody today is Thursday April 3r 25 and our friends Michael Hudson and Richard W are back with us welcome back thank you let's talk about The Liberation day and the new tariffs on each and every country on this planet and here is what the press secretary the the White House Press secretary said about the tariffs uh they're not going to be wrong it is going to work and the president has a brilliant team of advisers who have been studying these issues for decades um and we are focused on restoring the Golden Age of America and making America manufacturing superpower and again Peter I would point you to the Investments that have already trickled into this country and yeah let let's put the main question right now is what is the main economic fallacy that President Trump is perpetuating regarding the US trade deficit Michael go ahead well the fallacy is the way in which he's calculated his statistics and the fallacy is somehow that our tariffs are going to uh reindustrialize the United States the way that he's structured them uh he has not taken into account that a a very large share of us Imports are from foreign Affiliates of American firms and uh these Affiliates all of a sudden uh who that have uh made foreign foreign investments and not only in Canada and Mexico uh but in Asia and Vietnam and other countries are now going to have their costs uh very sharply increased uh the result of the tariffs is are actually going to be causing as we've discussed before vast instability and and destabilization uh I think Richard and I have talked in two of your shows about tariffs and the fact is uh I don't think we expected this to happen we thought that the United States like other countries were going to act in its self-interest and uh of course you realize that this self-interest is that of the corporate Elite and the big Financial investors in the uh Trump's donor class but uh they didn't expect any of this either and that's the big surprise uh the stock market yesterday actually Rose throughout the day as people thought well he can't really mean it and uh the that's plunge so quickly after a speech and this morning uh they continued to plunge it opened with the standard and pour down 4% and the do Jones losing I'm 1500 points by three and a half% these are gigantic plunges and Japan was hit even even harder so now we know why he timed his announcements uh to 4m that's when the stock market closed uh if TV viewers of his talk were able to see it during uh stock market hours they'd see him talking on the one hand and the split screen would show the stock market plunging in other words uh this is big Capital this is the corporate sector this is uh What uh the bulk of investors think the effect is going to be on uh on the stock market and they think it's a disaster uh there's been I I don't know how much money's been wiped out just in the first hour of trading uh but it's uh it's it's been gigantic so uh this this shows the degree to which corporations and investor thought well this is all uh Bluster and in a way I think it is Bluster and we've seen that by uh what's happened with the uh what Trump has been talking about for the last uh month and that's the tariffs on Canada uh and Mexico uh he uh if you look at the tariffs threats that he had 25% tariffs he's backed down on uh just about uh everything uh [Music] he uh the mainstream press you know is talking about a maralago Accord of a new Plaza Accord referring to the 1985 uh agreement with Japan that ended up pushing that economy into 30 years depression uh but that was part of a negotiated uh G7 uh agreement uh where the the US brought everybody together but this is different uh Trump is acting unilaterally and his strategy is to divide and conquer he's going to negotiate with each country separately and agree to soften his tariff if they give America something of value for instance uh in China I'm sure he wants to say uh you've got to sell Tick Tock to us investors you've got to uh do whatever the neocons are insisting that he uh tells them to do so uh the uh the right to buy out any key industry or real estate is uh what other countries are doing basically what Trump yesterday is uh these disruptions that he's threatening are so large that he's going to destabilize other countries unless they give in to uh what turns out to be a shapedown I just want to talk about the details with Canada because they're not they were not made clear yesterday uh he's left out uh he's already said well in term there's not going to be a tariff on auto parts at least until May 3d that's a month from now uh so and there's going to be a partial exemption for cars made in Mexico and Canada that uh meets the terms of the naft agreement after all there's been a huge uh break uh backdown in all of this uh on on on vehicles he's only going to uh try to tax the foreign made parts that are in these vehicles but that's uh still a threat and the question is whether this is going to prevent General Motors uh which has a very large proportion of its uh uh Autos uh made in Mexico and Canada uh for the Parts is this going to prevent them from making a profit and U suppose that it looks like the head of General Motors may have uh called Trump in the last month and said look if you're going to impose the tariffs the way you threaten to do then we're not going to be able to make a profit and if we're not able to make a profit what are we going to do are we going to lay off the labor force uh suppose that oos Mr Trump that I head of GM went to uh and threatened uh to uh make a public announcement we're putting GM up for sale there's no way we can make a profit any longer under ter under the way in which Trump did the trit the uh the the tariffs uh we're going to tell our our Labor uh we may have to lay you off um maybe a foreign auto company will want to bias but uh uh we uh being prevented from making a profit unless we raise the price of of American cars so high that Americans can't afford it as the econom is moving into the uh depression that uh Trump is H driving it into we'll have no recourse but to do that that's and other Industries may follow soup look at Apple in China it it's another multinational company importing uh its the parts for its iPhones and computers uh 100% of us oil imports are made by us oil companies the same is true of much of the mineral trade so why uh the question is why aren't uh Us corporate leaders speaking up uh more verbally than they have you remember you you remember uh back in the 60s General Motors famous head Charlie Wilson said what's good for General Motors is good for the country well the new motto is what Donald Trump says is good for the country is bad for General Motors uh it's still going to be one of the hardest auto companies hit because of its proportion of abroad so where is where is the power elite in all of this Richard it seems that Donald Trump believes that the deficit is the outcome of unfair Trade Practices but in your opinion does does trade deficit reflect a country spending more than it produces or saving less than it invests okay there's so much noise and Chaos around this that we are in danger anger and that may be Mr Trump's area of wisdom uh manipulating the noise level and distractions and claims you know you made a joke and I understand it about Liberation day but that's a very important part of the story he wants us to come away with so we can go add it in a number of ways I'm going to choose two but then you know you take it where you think it should go in in in setting this up first the notion that we have been victimized by foreigners this is the largest nonsense I've heard in a long time you know it reminds me of the kind of conversation you get with a white supremacist who explains and whines that white people are at the wrong end of discrimination uh in this country the attempt to snatch from the black and brown people who've actually suffered uh centuries of repression from white people to try to erase all of that by telling some story that makes it all reversed I mean it is it is preposterous it is outrageous and it is a manipulation by demagogues who use the difficulties white people have and those are gen those are genuine economic difficulties for whites have been serious but to blame victimization at the hands of black and brown people is an spectacular effort to shift to the right what is a problem with American capitalism and has been from the beginning the notion that the that the people of Vietnam uh who got a tremendous increase in their tariff are oppressing the United stat foreigners oppressing is is catastrophic in its misunderstanding the last 50 years were times in which Americans lost jobs that's correct but the reason they did was the profit maximizing strategy of American corporations who left the Chinese couldn't have done it by themselves they're over there no one held a gun to anyone's head and said close your fact in Cincinnati and open it in Shanghai that was done because the American corporation saw a again they could pay workers a lot less and they'd be located in the fastest growing Market on Earth the United States couldn't compete on either one of those things and so it lost but the agent of the change was Corporate America the very Industries it's fantastic to have a leader like Mr Trump suggest that the blame for that falls on the foreign country what a what a strange effort to get the corporate leaders of America who made the key decisions off the hook they're not part of the story it's Liberation from the evil and who's the evil foreigners this is as old as Methuselah it it it is really BS of the first rank liberating us the whole rest of the world has been working for two or three centuries to liberate itself from imperialists and colonialists like the United States and here he is turning it around we're going to liberate from them just like a white supremacist we have to be liberated from the pressure of black and brown people and their allies nobody should be fooled by this number one now number two tariffs are not new tariffs have been used by countries including the United States at various points in their history there is a huge literature books and articles courses are taught in every economics Department called international trade or International economics and they have a segment of the course on tariffs I've taught the courses I know what I'm talking about about Mr Trump clearly doesn't what does the literature teach us the impact of a tariff depends on the circumstances in all of the countries affected by the Tariff you cannot know in advance it will have this particular outcome why not because it depends on interest rates on exchange rates on monetary movements on whether or not the country countries retaliate and if they do retaliate how will there then be response on the United States part Secretary of the Treasury made a statement yesterday that he hopes no country retaliates and when the reporter asked him why he said because then there'll be escalation as if what Mr Trump has just done isn't escalation the level of BS here is overwhelming Mr Trump cannot know what the consequence will be will there be an inflation probably will it be hard and terrible could be will it be mild could be you know there is no way to do this the important thing here is that this is a declaration of desperation not Liberation this is an economy that has to now attack the whole world that's it that's what it's doing it's making difficulties for every other country it's and it's now holding the gun to every country as Michael just explained it now is going to say we will negotiate bilaterally one by one and we will play with these tariffs in order to squeeze you for some other agenda that we have or will develop we want a piece of this mind we want you not to pass that law we want you to give us this money or maybe give us Greenland or whatever else he has in mind but let me clarify every country now understands that the United States has changed it is not going to administer an Empire of the whole world keeping the peace and having everyone rely on it doing that it is just like Mr Trump sometimes says we're throwing all of that out the window we are now going to weaponize our remaining assets we're no longer the biggest economic Block in the world that's China and the bricks but we're big enough that we can threaten and weaponize and force the rest of the world to give us a portion of its wealth you know what that means means Beyond a change of the last 50 years economic policy it means the United States is advertising itself as the new number one rolled nation in this world even China Japan and South Korea announced they're getting together those three countries have a a history of tension and conflict and bitterness all of that was put aside they're meeting together and I quote to coordinate their response to Mr Trump wow Europe who could never unify and therefore gave up the ghost as an economic Powerhouse when they were allied with the United States May by result of Mr Trump be able to unify against the United States it's I admit it's a long shot disunity in Europe it is intrinsic to that poor continent but that's the reality no one should be fooled the isolation of the United States is what we are watching big time I want to get into the nitty-gritty of the details because that's where the devil all of is what countries are threat what just let me ask the question is which is so important why will Trump's tariffs fail to close the US trade deficit are the tariffs addressing the root causes of the trade deficit uh because the trade def def deficit is a result of the de-industrialization that we've been talking about on your show for the last uh uh few months there's no way that you can uh the tariffs can suddenly uh in within one week one month or five years uh create an a domestic ability to produce these products what others knew but mention of is if you impose the tariffs in order to produce here the Autos uh parts and the all of the manual labor uh that we've been uh importing from Southeast Asia it takes five years to organize a factory to make the planning to organize a labor force to raise the money to organize the marketing distribution uh Trump believes that in one week we can suddenly reindustrialize he's leaving about he's leaving out the time element uh it in if you're going to reindustrialize the United States uh you're going to have to build factories here and as we've discussed in the past I really don't want to re go over the past shows that we've done except uh to do what Richard has done and sort of uh Set uh describe uh the setting but uh what suppose we set up factories here to make to hire uh uh labor to uh do the manual labor to make the toys and all of the kinds of consumer goods that Walmart has been importing from China uh you're going to have to pay uh you're going to have to raise the tariffs by I'd say about 300% you will have to uh raise uh the cost of doing B consumer uh price index by maybe 40% because uh if the Americans produce these how are you going to hire labor that uh you have to uh provide with health insurance uh that you have to uh provide with enough money to bu uh housing that's Rising medical costs that are seing the cost of of uh employing labor in the United States has been escalating partly because of the privatization uh that that's occurred of uh of Public Services that hitherto were provided at subsidized rates so that corporations did not have to pay uh high enough wages because the government was taking care of a lot of basic needs all of this has made America a high cost economy but I I really would like to talk talk about what uh how what Trump's specific strategy is within all of this could I yeah could I just add something before M that go ahead there is another thing everything Michael said is right I just want to add something Mr Trump's Herky jerky Behavior the the can Canada Trump the Canada Mexico tariff go up then it goes down then it is modified then it is adjusted and now we are told that he's willing to negotiate with all of the other tariff victims to get this from this one to get that from the here's what that means it means that none of these tariffs are a certainty no planning Corporation can say okay this is the new level of expenses I have with the Tariff being what it is so I'm going to compare uh when I decide where to build my next Factory uh all my options he can't do that because the Tariff that he's counting may not be there next month may not be there next year in which case the enormous expense that's why it's so important what Michael just said it takes years and a lot of money to move a a production facility from one place to another or to reorg iiz your supply chain because instead of building in this country over the next 10 years as you had planned you're going to have to move your new factories and that means you have to rearrange your supply all of that is enormously expensive no Corporation is going to undertake those expenses only to discover after having spent $2 billion that the5 billion project is now to be abandoned because the tariffs were changed on your supplier on you he can't do what he is doing it will mean that corporations are hesitant will hold back on these decisions will delay them and as every undergraduate student in economics learns in capitalism we are all held hostage to corporate plans about investment the working class getss money and spends it end of conversation not interesting the corporate sector earns profits and then decides whether or not to invest them if it's profitable if it isn't they'll lend it to the United States government or put it in some other nonproductive activity and that will cause us depressions recessions delays all kinds of no one talks about this Mr Trump wants the freedom he likes the deal to be made yeah will no one explain to him none of his advisers who all have phds or many of them do from fancy universities just like Michael and me but they didn't explain to him you can't do that as if it had no effect the United States isn't the overwhelming Powerhouse that it was in the second half of the 20th century that's the Empire that's over and this is the desperate largely blind desperate gesture of a government that cannot admit where it is and fantasizes that it can do all these things as if they're automatic they aren't now let's go and let Michael explain that in the most important statistical focus when you look at the statistics and how Trump's explanation you realize how really goofy all of this is and the goofiness is something new that uh we haven't neither Richard nor I nor anyone else could have imagined would have come up uh the commentators have been puzzling over how how did Trump come up with these charts explaining how other countries were exploiting us with tariff and trade policies of enormous magnitude far above their actual tariff rates how is it that we can impose tariffs of 50% of 40% how can uh because they're punishing us with 100% tariffs and 40 and 80% tariffs these are goofy figures nobody it took people uh I got calls last night from former presidential candidates and research foundations asking me what do these numbers mean and it took me hours to figure out how goofy uh they all were uh in so it's worthwhile taking a minute it'll it's actually going to take about 10 or 15 minutes to explain how Trump calculated these tariffs uh uh at first look look it seems like he wants just to beat up the poorest and weaker countries like uh Myanmar Burma Bangladesh that's what bullies do uh and he wants to cut out uh Chinese proxy factories in Vietnam but when look when looks his numbers you see the deception at the work he explained that the Tariff rates attributed to other countries against United States uh were not merely the official tariff rates that we all look at but some countries are attacking us in two ways some are buying US Dollars by holding their reserves in dollars they do this to recycle their dollars uh to the United States to prevent their currencies from rising and they hold their foreign reserves in dollars this is the US treasury bill standard this is what uh enabled America to get a free lunch by uh blocking other countries from buying gold and depleting America's Gold stock and forcing them to use their economic and trade surplus to lend to the US Treasury Trump says that instead of that recognizing that that's been the key to America's Financial imperialism that's been an attack on us uh and the other problem uh that they've been attacking us is being too poor to buy as many exports uh from us as we've been buying from them so Taiwan is accused of a 60% 64 uh perc tariff uh China 67% tariff India 52% tariff Vietnam of 90% tariffs uh and in addition to Vietnam they're Laos and Cambodia with 49% tariffs and uh Thailand and Indonesia uh are imposed tariffs of 36 and 32% who would have thought that these are the countries that are leading an economic war against the United States to take advantage of us uh this seems bizarre at uh First Sight uh as Richard pointed out South Korea and Japan are singled out uh many of the imports from them are from Affiliates of us multinationals or there are allies well Trump has it claims that other countries are reex recycling their export earnings into buying dollars that's artificial that's currency manipulation and if they didn't buy US Treasury bonds if they didn't buy US Stocks then uh they uh their currencies uh would have gone up and presumably made American uh industrial exports more competitive if we had in any industry to produce these exports which we don't anymore uh so uh the uh I think what's upside down here is that it's not that other countries have uh fought to manipulate their currency it's that the United States dollar has risen against every other currency uh in the world Bas in in the last decade and this began with uh Obama's uh resolution of the junk mortgage fraud in 2008 the solution of the Obama Administration was for the Federal Reserve to come in and pursue a zero interest rate policy that uh caused an enormous amount of the uh of gain for the stock market and the biggest Bond rally in history has uh resulted from uh lowering the uh price of uh credit of bonds you know from 5% 6% all the way down to uh 0 1% well the if you look at the distribution of wealth in America uh the bottom 50% haven't increased their wealth at all it's a teeny little sliver of uh their St stock market Holdings and wealth since 2008 all of this increase in wealth has accured to the top 10% and almost entirely in stock and bond and real estate prices so the United States dollar has been soaring against other countries uh it's not because uh we're exporting more uh because we're in de-industrializing uh it's not because of our uh Budget moving into deficit into Surplus because we've been running a budget deficit of a huge proportions uh and we've been spending military uh uh money all over the world how is it that America has de-industrializing uh huge military spending with a huge budget deficit has been raising the uh the Dollar's exchange rate except by creating this hot house artificial manipulated uh uh uh stop market boom that has attracted uh speculative investment capital from all the other countries the reason for these exchange rate shifts is has nothing to do with trade it's all about the financial sector uh and not a word about that uh from Trump and uh the it turns out Michel Michael let let me just add let me break in an add just very quickly please the phony or goofy numbers that are being put out here to get these crazy tariff rates that have been imposed on the United States by by counting in in this bizarre way the deficits I want to remind people the the trade deficit that that the fact that we send out dollars to buy tons and tons of stuff that's what puts the dollars in the hands of the countries from which we buy okay and why do we do that because the American companies moved over there there's also local companies over there and French and German and British but American companies are a very large part of why we send all those dollars over there okay now what do they do with the dollars let's be real clear they lend them back to the United States they they buy treasuries and let let's be clear what that means is that an oppression of the United United States of course not here's what it has made possible the United States has been able to fight the Vietnam War the afghanistani war the Iraq War and the Ukraine war last week the New York Times published how big the United States has been in that war from the beginning and we were able to do that without taxing the American people you know why because all of those holders of dollars lent the money to the United States government to pay for the war patriotic Americans ought to be grateful we got them to pay for those countries many of whom let me make it clear to you are on Russia's side like China lent money to the United States to fight a war against Russia and we are wanting to claim now they oppressed us those foreigners oppressed us us believe me if the American people had been taxed to pay for those Wars if they were taxed today to pay for the war in Ukraine the war in Gaza and all the other things they're paying for these wars would have stopped so it th this recalculation to fit into the crazy narrative that Mr Trump wants to put forward is really bizarre and the last point the rest of the world has not been dumping on us we have tariffs that have been in place for 50 years and I I keep wanting to remind Americans 50 over 50 years ago we imposed a tariff on European makers of pickup trucks a big fat 25% tariff it's been in effect for the last 50 years Americans are not in love with pickup trucks because they make men feel manly the advertising that made men feel that way came once it was profitable to produce a pickup truck and you needed to convince Americans to buy that thing rather than a car which has only a 2% or two and a half% tariff on it the United States has been wielding tariffs last point we used to call tariffs the IFI tffs it's the way you teach it in a university because it has something to do with a an event we call infant industry the idea here is when you're a a poor country when you're just coming out from being a colony for example like the United States once was and you you want to build up your industry you have a hard time competing against those who've been doing that industry for 50 years so there is a a notion temporarily you put a tariff just to get your infant to maturity then you take away the Tariff because you want the benefits so-called of competition that's the story told in every textbook well we're not a little country with an infant industry that's what all those other countries are like Bangladesh and Vietnam they have a reason in a justification we don't this is turning all of it on its head we're all supposed to believe now that 200 years of economic theory 50 years of experience in free trade that the solute which the United States benefited from and the solution is to throw it all out the window and go with that stable Genius of Economic Policy Donald Trump you must be kidding so you're saying that we're protecting decadence not infant industry I love it uh but uh you also mentioned that uh when we uh uh import we provide uh uh countries with money but uh this is exactly the imbalance that Trump how this worked out uh from what the government announced uh for every country they took the trade deficit with that country and they divided it by that countries export to us so uh if we have an $8 billion doll trade deficit with Indonesia uh that uh supports uh and its exports to 28 uh billion uh then if you divide uh 18 by 28 that's 64% that's where that crazy number for Indonesia came and uh he claims that that's the Tariff rate that Indonesia uh charges it's not a tariff rate it's a measure of the imbalance of trade and of course the imbalance of trade is largest with uh the poorest countries uh in the world because they can't afford to pay very much largely because of the uh polarization of the world economy that the United States created after World War uh two so of course we uh import uh from uh Vietnam low-wage products and from Iraq and uh raw materials exporters on the list of they're too poor to buy the United States and that has nothing to has zero to do with tariffs at all uh there's a rationalization for this treatment and that's what I want to I want to talk about because that's so crazy and I I mentioned briefly in summary what that was before if a country's extra change rate Falls against the dollar that's considered an attack on the US economy against what Trump is responding in kind so let's look at the most guilty again Myanmar Madagascar 93% letho 99% Serbian batswana 74% uh Guana 76% H how can these poorest countries that are running a trade deficit being aggressing to the United States well the answer is either that they're poor or that their exchange rates are plunging or that they're recycling money that they uh uh earn into loans to the US Treasury because of the Dollar's exorbitant privilege of what used to be what I've called super imperialism that's uh not trade aggression uh and Trump has even uh in a separate talks for the last month talked about charging a financial tariffs for other countries to buy us Securities tery Securities or stock in other words if they buy stocks they'll have to pay a 5% penalty or tariff to recycle their money well that means that the money that has been reflowing into treasury Securities uh has been uh is going to to stop what's it going to do 5% is a huge amount on Treasury Securities that are earning Less in other words either they lose lose money on Treasury Securities or they buy something else what's happening I I didn't mention it but gold prices are way up they're Drive Trump is driving other countries out of the dollar into gold and he's driving it together the other countries together to create their own M Mutual Holdings of each other's currencies but Trump says that if other countries if the bricks countries get together and find an alternative to the dollar and buy their currencies then that's another form of trade aggression against the United States and he's going to retaliate them to prevent them from having an alternative to the dollar so what he wants to do is lock them into the US dollar losing money uh where they the interest they get on the dollar will be less than the trade penalty uh the uh investment penalty they have to pay uh and that is an unpre unprecedented form of financial exploitation uh this financial tariff for buying uh companies uh by buying us Securities that's something entirely new the whole rest of the world is supposed to be turned into a tributary economy to the United States uh uh based on blocking them uh from having an alternative to the dollar but making them lose money on every stock Bond or treasury security that they buy that's uh the big picture that he's trying to impose and uh he's saying that if you don't uh submit to this we're going to wreck your economy by interrupting your exports what's going to happen to all your factories and the labor that's working in these factories now uh uh you you can't make money uh uh uh exporting into the United States unless we raise our PR consumer prices by 10 or 20% this year well the result is they are going to continue exporting because the United States doesn't have an alternative to these exports because it takes time to build the factories and as Richard pointed out how are you going to take the time to build the factories if the ter these the Tariff terms are going to be renegotiated uh every year so by Trump it's it's uh it's chaos that that's that's the plan uh somehow chaos is going to uh save the United States and uh uh be able to protect our uh de-industrialized decadence Richard just let me let me what I'm understanding from you both that the the contribution of the americaas corporate ruling class and fiscal responsibility which is the budget deficit caused by the tax cuts for the wealthy and the the spending on Wars and the excessive budget of the militaries how how is that going to influence is that are they the main reasons for the budget deficit which finally leads to a trade deficit well the the way to understand this is to understand that we have a very peculiar political economy in the United States we have think of it this way we have the 3% of our population that are employers that's the top of our economic system and that becomes the self-reproducing group of people they make all the decisions whether or not to invest the money they're the ones who set the prices we pay and they're the ones who pay the wages or not that we depend on so we we are controlled by the 3% of the employer that's the way capitalism is set up okay they long ago understood the people at the top what they have to do because we have a political system that is a little odd to go with a top- down economic system in our political system we have universal suffrage everybody gets one vote well the vast majority of people 97% are not employers 3% are it would be easy to mobilize a majority of the 97% to limit the wealth of the 3% in fact you would expect that to happen because the 3% are the ones with all the money and the 97% are the ones who control the majority in the voting so what did the the the the ruling class of 3% do in America they bought the government of course that's how they protect their situation in a world of universal suffrage and how did they do it they did it with two political parties each of them depends on the 3% for their money the donor class if you like the 3% and now they divide half of them go to the right and mobilize a mass support you know for things like guns and white supremacy and against abortion and all of that and the other ones they go for more liberal Progressive social welfare all of that and minorities and women and so we have two parties both of whom control the mass of the vote now the punchline what the system does is it goes to the rich people says you're the donors so we won't we won't tax you then it goes each party to its mass space we'll take care of you we'll give you this we'll give you that here's the problem you can't buy the mass of people unless you tax where the wealth is but there is a way out in the craziness of capitalism you don't tax the wealthy you do provide for the mass of people and the way you do it is you go to the wealthy and you say since we didn't tax you you have all this money please lend it to us we'll give it back to you after a few years plus pay you interest while you wait that's called the deficit and the reason we have a deficit is a difference to those at the top to not tax them to pay for the masses I'll give you one simple example Elon Musk the last I looked has $350 billion or more of personal wealth if you taxed away because we the majority voted for it if you taxed away half his money he'd still be the richest person on Earth but the government would have $250 billion doll with which to solve social problems and you know who would be better off if we solved the social problems with his money Mr musk he would live in a less conflicted Society he would be less at risk from Angry poor people etc etc etc it is irrational and what you're watching with Mr TR Trump in the Rose Garden is the irrational effort to deal with an irrational problem whose irrationality you dare not admit so you're going to now do what punish the rest of the world you know what it reminds me of every now and then here in the United States a city New York Philadelphia any tries to solve its economic problems once again not taxing the rich by taxing commuters New York has famously toyed with that idea the people of New Jersey get enraged because a government not of them another state New York is solving its problems in part on the back of people that are not New York voters have no say in any of this and so it usually comes to grief you can't do that you can't do that you know why because it risks blowing the United States apart and you know what Mr Trump is doing he's risking not blowing the world apart it'll stay but making the United States the isolated Rogue nation that this looks like to the rest of the world beware that is a very large danger that will come back and bite this country in places I don't even want to think about well Richard's quite right in Shifting the uh Focus from tariffs to taxes uh because uh why Trump's whole focus on tariff is as he said to idealize the Gilded Age of President McKinley and in the until 1913 the United States didn't have an income tax on uh rich people uh it it uh the the US government budget was uh funded mainly by tariff revenues and also by land sales of the land that it seized from the Native Americans including uh my ancestors uh and so uh it no income tax at all and Trump says look there was a Gilded Age in which uh the rich people weren't taxed and then what happened to Trump said it was a disaster 1913 you had an income tax and the income tax F uh uh almost entirely uh only 2% of the American population had to paying income tax the rich were the financial sector the real estate the monopolists uh and the property owners U economic rent uh is what was taxed uh uh not uh not labor not in not industry very much and uh so Trump says what I want to do is roll back history and reverse it to make history run backwards to the time when uh we uh can restore tariffs as attacks on labor and on industry and leave the all the economic surplus in the hands of the financial class the monopolists and the uh real estate sector the ronier sector that's his big plan to to move to essentially reduce the whole dynamic of industrial capitalism that Richard and I have been talking about for the last half Year back towards the kind of feudal ideal where uh you you had a a ronti sector receiving unearned income economic rent land rent Monopoly rent and financial uh interest and uh fees that that's basically the kind of world that he wants to restore and he said look how rich it was but it was the most unequal uh distribution of wealth and income in American history that's why it was called the Gilded Age in the rest of the country you had the growth of the populist parties uh fighting and uh saying you have to have a reform it was the populists of the western states and the Midwestern states that uh tried U already in the n in the 1880s uh to get an income tax and to support the8 hour day and to support labor unionization and to uh make federal law against companies uh calling in strike Breakers to violently break up uh attempts by labor to unionize that is if you look at how that world was uh the great Pullman strikes and the massacres and the terrorism that was taking place uh and the absolute corruption uh of government that is the ideal uh that America that Trump uh wants to present prevent as making America great again is rolling back history to before the whole century and a half of democratic reform what you you've just mentioned is all about the federal budget deficit which would be reflected in the trade deficit isn't it Richard yes those two are linked very closely because in order to run a deficit you have to issue treasury Securities and in order to sell the treasury Securities you have to have the rest of the world because America can't buy back its own treasury Securities at the level that need to be sold you have this problem that's how the American Empire organized itself now that that Empire is declining it is dissolving its own organization it's very internal to what is going on if the United States were still a superpower it wouldn't need to do this that's why Obama didn't that's why Bush didn't that's why Clinton it's not that they're any less smart than Mr Trump or any less committed to making America number one they didn't need to we supported free trade for the last 50 years because United States did real well for the people that matter in this country and dribbled off enough to the rest to keep them quiet they can't do it anymore so they now want as Michael says tributary a tributary economy you better give us Tick Tock you better give us the Panama Canal you better give us Greenland you better give us your minerals look at the deal they're imposing on on Mr zalinski etc etc this is a this is now fevery open and and and un undisguised the way it had been before but it's a sign of desperation you don't want to do this let me tell you where this is going to go because America an have a a stunning inability to to imagine that other people have the same understanding they do though people of the world are understanding the United States has become their enemy look at the numbers Canadians are not coming here as tourists anymore European governments are telling trans people around the world it's not safe to travel to the United States well that anger and that bitterness will now be enhanced by the the governments there who are wanting to get out of the blame for the difficulties this is going to cause if Germany cannot sell its BMWs and its Mercedes in this country anymore because of these whopping tariffs and they have to lay off large numbers of German Workers that's going to be explained to the German people that's Mr Trump the Americans are doing that to you now guess what angry people people around the world are going to here we go stop buying American look at what has happened in the last three months to the Tesla automobile nobody will touch it Mr musk is discovering that there are real costs to prancing around the stage with a chainsaw celebrating how he's firing tens of thousands of workers well guess what they have a way of getting back at him whether it's damaging a Tesla car or anything American Goods in the rest of the world they're not going to all be wearing jeans because Americans are they're GNA find a new pair of pants not produced in the United States and the jeans Market will dissolve and that that's just the tip of the iceberg here Mr Trump is telling a story a fanciful story about these wonderful things that are going to flow from what he's done he doesn't tell you even the most Elementary honesty of all the things that could go wrong here and the notion that none of them will happen that's so Preposterous he can't afford to be honest he has to be a huster an Advertiser remember what an Advertiser is a person who figure out real and imagined good things about his client's project and product and he makes disappear all the bad ones this can only help you it won't hurt you it can only just it's the mentality of The Advertiser only this person is now the leader and is telling us desperate stories because his client is an Empire going down I'm glad you mentioned tourism uh and uh demographics uh because uh that is a very major contributor to the US balance of payments especially from Canada our tourists going into the snowbirds they call them going into Florida but also uh students um universities in America are very largely uh increasingly reliant on students from China and other countries that pay the whole 50,000 or $775,000 tuition a year now all of a sudden with the uh Ice uh arresting students that uh are against that talk out and say we're against genocide in principle uh you know we're we think uh that the Gaza Palestinians shouldn't be killed they're all of a sudden seized and deported now this has had a paralyzing effect on other countries uh sending their students here they're not the Canadians have already cancelled their uh are reported to be cancelling many of their travel uh meetings that they'd planned for the summer to the United States um and for the winter there's a the the non-trade elements of the US balance of payments in the form of Tourism students uh uh is another damage that is going to push the US uh def it even further and the United States uh is blocking other countries from financing this deficit by buying treasury bills so you can expect a uh very sharp decline uh in the dollar and that means that uh foreign goods are going to be much more expensive uh there's going to be a very large inflation here that's going to squeeze the uh the work weight wage earning class uh that already is falling behind in uh uh in its uh Home Loans in its uh student debt and its uh credit card debt and its Bank debt so uh we're uh the the worry of the stock market is there's going to be a break in the chain of payments defaults uh and unless uh you can bring Obama back in to say we're going to foreclose uh on the poor people and kick them out of their houses like uh he kicked out 8 million uh uh homeowners that were victimized by junk mortgages unless you can repeat the Obama's class War uh you're you're going to have a polarization in the United States that uh may actually lead other people to begin discussing uh the kind of alternative that Richard and I have been talking about yeah I think it's very serious I I I think if you're looking for a way to hold in your mind the complexity of all of this coupled with all the noise around it it it is beginning to make clear what Maga means it wants to go back to the end of the 19th century to an economy utterly controlled by a private capitalist elite that was much but bigger then because our Industries weren't so concentrated now it you know the many companies have become many fewer companies so the ruling class is much more condensed much smaller much able to coordinate a little bit better and they want to run the show they're convinced that private Enterprise namely them are better than anything else so they're going to privatize and they're going to go after poor people in this country look at the efforts to cut Medicaid that are now getting some Traction in Congress coupled with these efforts to Smash down the poorest countries on Earth can you imagine Myan Mar had one of the worst earthquakes in in history a few days ago and he still went ahead and included them in h look at the mentality you are destroying the poorest people blaming immigrants among the poorest people who ripped themselves out of Central America where where they were poor to begin with grabbing the stuff on the back that they can carry with their children and their elderly coming to the United States and making a big proud effort of expelling them a country that claimed it owed its greatness to being a Melting Pot for immigrants is now not melting in the old sense it's melting by literally killing these people in terms of what it's doing to them extraordinary way to make your own country healthier economically on the backs of the poorest of the poor wow and to think you can keep doing that without retribution coming is an amazing Act of stupidity and immigrant labor who's going to make all of the toys and the textile and the Walmart uh consumer goods that are being made by uh by Foreign Labor uh you're going to have uh it'll be a labor shortage here because it's very unlikely that you're going to have uh college graduates or high school graduates or uh let's say uh the American style labor performing the kind of Duties that the Asians have been but careful when I talk to those people here's what you know I use their idioms so I don't frighten them they will they explain to me no no no no no no that's what AI is for AI is going to substitute for all of the work we're going to be able to do all of this because robots will be doing everything and and then I say to them and what happens to the millions then who have no job and they look at me and they say the honest ones we will wait for them to die off we're living in a country where this is becoming the humane way to cope you cannot criticize the economic system so you have to welcome Mass death wow that's a commitment to an economic system that shows above all that that system needs to go Michael so the budget deficit is primarily due to the due to tax cuts for the rich Reckless military spending and the interest payments on the growing national debt not waste in civil servant salaries of course civilians let me do that quickly just again to remind civilian labor force of the federal government two and a half million people the other two and a half that the federal government pays are the military I'm going to put them aside so two and a half million people are federal government if you wanted to have efficiency you would look at the federal government but we have two other levels of government state government and local government and they're much bigger state government across 50 states is 5 million civilian employees and local government 15 million so state and local is 20 million federal government is on10th two and a half million if you're interested in efficiency why would you go after the smallest one that's stupid but here's the stupidity even worse in the 1960s if you look at the list the government civilian federal civilian employees two and a half million here we are a half century later our population 100 million people bigger and we still service them with two and a half million civilian federal employees you know what economists call that efficiency 2 and a half million are Servicing million more that's the last place then you would go and cut if you're interested in government efficiency have a program to deal with state and local if you actually this is all fake this is all Foolery or if you like advertising he's advertising look at me I am hoping that no one knows what I just told you but that is the reality I didn't make the numbers up and you'll never hear those numbers from the spokespersons because of what they obviously tell you which is this is a talk about Mr Trump's fake news he's generating fake news at a speed way ahead of all of those he criticized for that over his lifetime so Michael what are the broader implications of trump trade and fiscal policies for the United States and and the global economy it seems that the United States could make the US the enemy of the World by harming both domestic and Global economies we we've just uh explained that the purpose of tariffs is to protect decadence not uh an infant INF R uh the uh you would you would have what you'd have to roll back is the whole transition of the United States into a post-industrial financialized rent-seeking economy uh but the ronas have cannibalized industry uh and uh I don't there there is no political party that is uh Pro uh supporting an alternative that's what we've also been speaking about on your show not the Democrats and not the Republicans there's no uh there's no populist party today as uh arose in the 1880s and 1890s uh there's no William Jennings Brian had to say don't crucify labor on the cross of gold which is now a cross of uh the cross of debt of personal debt that they can't pay local debt corporate debt government debt uh there there's uh uh there's none of that even being discussed so uh part of this uh at least in the um Gilded Age you did have Alternatives being discussed and you had the populist uh party representing between a quarter and 40% of Americans voters in the 1880s where are they today there's nowhere uh there's no sign of them emerging there's no academic alternative as there was in the American School of uh Pro protection protectionist economics uh the industrialization the whole logic of industrialization in the 1890s uh including under under uh the Democrats Grover Cleveland as well as McKinley said if if America is going to get rich and become the industrial power we need High wage Labor uh High wage labor can drive drive out popper labor we need to raise living standards uh and we don't want the corporations to have to pay uh uh High wages so we're going to have the government provide all sorts of public services so that uh Corp industrial corporations can employ labor that is Raising its productivity raising its living standards because of uh public investment but government uh railroads Education Health Care communication uh uh Parks Urban improvements none of that all of that has been become privatized and uh thatcherized and we're going we're going we're really rolling history back in time without uh any understanding of the time we're returning to is an idealized autocracy uh a time only for the wealthiest uh uh ruling class not for the uh the Agriculture and the industry that was being so highly exploited in what uh Trump considers to be the guilted age Richard it seems that programs like Medicaid Social Security Medicare are at risk of being caught to fund additional tax breaks for the realy and that that is I don't know if the Congress would go along with Donald Trump if that happens yeah that's the only question the Democrats will be the ones who do all of this kind of stuff more slowly and they will appeal to their base as they always do now that you're suffering from what the Republicans are doing to you wouldn't you prefer if this were done more slowly they won't say it quite like that but most people will know remember half the American people have figured out that this is silly and don't bother voting or paying attention even if they do vote they vote for other reasons but not out of an engagement with the material which is denied them it's not their fault it really isn't uh appealing to them to vote and making it absurd to do so is a is a bad combination but I think we're not anymore in the Tweedle Dum tweetle d game that's what those parties will do because that's what they've always done and they don't have the the competitor as Michael just pointed out that would make that risky for that to happen you have to have an upsurge of a new and an independent political movement that that puts their feet to the fire and exposes what this Tweedle Dum and Tweedle D have done to the United States Mr Trump inherited from Biden Biden inherited and you can go backwards they're all complicit in this game they've all been playing it all that Mr Trump is doing is correctly surmising that people are getting sick and tired so he decided to be a more extreme version of the Republican party but that's all he is he is taking us back to what Republican employer class mentality has always wanted everything should be done by the private employer he should not be regulated by the government it should not be taxed by the government because if the government gets out the old l a fair nonsense well then everything will work well the last time we tried that it eventuated in the greatest crash of capitalism in its history 1929 if we allow that to happen again the world is very different then the United States had no serious economic competitor in 1929 it's got one now and the whole world is different and abusing the world as we go into the risk of a crash or even a recession is terribly stupid and would only be done by people who no longer can see any other way to hold on to the notion that the best thing this country needs is to damage the poor restrict the working class and do everything possible to protect the people at the top but then again come on folks you all know enough about history when the empires of the past Greek Roman Persian of them when they go down you know what always happens the people at the top the richest and the most powerful use their position to be the last ones to lose as the Empire goes down to hold on to what's theirs and that means the costs of a declining Empire are offloaded from them onto the rest of us that's what's happening y thank you thank you so much Richard Michael great pleasure as always okay thank you take care
