hi everybody today is Thursday November 21st and we're having we have Michael Hudson and Richard Wolff with us here welcome back thank you Nima glad to be here yeah and let's get started with the breaking news about n and glant we've learned that IC we've learned about the ICC arrest warrant on N who in Galant the former Defense Minister of Israel and here is what we heard from CNN criminal court has just issued arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former Israeli defense minister yev Galant accusing them of war crimes in Gaza and also for a top Hamas Commander also known as Muhammad de who is believed to be dead the court says it found reasonable grounds to believe the Prime Minister Bears criminal responsibility for war crimes including starvation as a method of warfare and it rejected Israel's challenge of the Court's Jurisdiction over the matter CNN's Nick Robertson joins us now from Jerusalem and Nick what more can you tell us well this is a very very significant escalation it was first announced by Kareem Khan the ICC Chief prosecutor back in May that he was going to seek to request arrest warrants for Benjamin Netanyahu and YF galun who was the defense minister at the time as well as three other senior Hamas officials including Muhammad de is Hane Yaya Sima the other those three are all dead uh de believed to have been killed in July so unclear why they've issued uh an arrest warrant now for him but by overturning um Israel's uh rejection of the jurisdiction and the allegations uh by the court this clears the way for something very very significant which prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Israel have never ever faced before these are very very serious uh charges and allegations as you read them out there um that the court believes he has they have grounds to believe that he Bears criminal responsibility for war crimes as you said including starvation as a method of warfare and of crimes against humanity of murder persecution and of other crimes these these are very very serious uh allegations these are not the sorts of allegations that the Prime Minister has faced before when they when the ICC first made these statements back in May uh the Prime Minister prime minister's office said that they were absurd uh that they were false and that they were a distortion of reality it is something that back then the Prime Minister took very very seriously has been in meetings today with the US mediator Amos HW talking about the possibility of a ceasefire with um with Hezbollah in Lebanon to the north but this is absolutely now going to come front and center uh of the prime minister's attention here yeah here is the reactions from the European Union the EU considers Joseph Bell said that the EU considers the ICC warrants against Nan Gant binding to be implemented and on the part of Israelis we are hearing that Israeli minister of National Security proposed extending the country's sovereignty over the West Bank in response to international criminal CT arrest warrant foro and Gant and your take Michael let's get started Michael well when I grew up people were still discussing the nberg trials and I can just imagine what netanyahu's defense uh if he were there uh would be he'd say these bombs that were dropped on uh on Gaza were not my bombs they were America's bombs uh we didn't Target a where a bomb the Americans targeted it I was only following orders uh of course that's not what he said what he said was how can you accuse me of genocide when we've said that the Palestinians are not human beings how can there be genocide against people who are not human uh that that is what he said he said it's anti-semitic to claim that Palestinians are human and we we killed other human beings uh I I think he's just uh uh driven 99% of the world to say if that sign is anti-Semitism well you can draw your conclusions Richard yeah well it it it seems to me that the uh slogan often attributed uh to the victims and opponents of nazist Holocaust was the phrase never again but what this shows us is that the phrase should be amended never again unless we do it then apparently the never again doesn't apply I want to stress one particular thing the Israelis Will Mock and dismiss what just happened as you can see uh that is what they basically have been doing all along but they are now yet again in one additional way isolated in the world I want to hammer at the isolation an isolation of Israel now having its its leader and chief be you know put under an arrest warrant for genocide it's extraordinary happens very rarely in the world he's getting that and the only significant support that Israel has is the United States that's why it's important for you to have read Joseph Burell statement from the EU which at least verbally I doubt they'll do much but verbally says we are not being taken down the road to isolation by contrast the United States is being taken down the road to further and further isolation as the financial and Military enabler of what has now been called genocide warranting arrest under the normal Notions of the law that I'm familiar with the accomplice to the crime is likewise subject what will prevent now a prosecutor especially when they get the response from Israel and what I will expect to be the response from the United States the demand will be made we may not hear about it but in the court the demand will be made if Netanyahu Behavior warrants an arrest why would Biden be exempt Biden has authorized the money and the weapons without which this genocide could not have been prosecuted and the many opportunities the United States had to stop it were not utilized thereby they have convicted themselves to be an accomplice and therefore the question will arise but even if it doesn't even if they avoid the embarrassment there it is and I want to stress not out of a defense I'm no supporter or Enthusiast for uh Vladimir Putin Lord knows but that war has been going on considerably longer and no comparable bombing of hospitals and schools and children has been committed the ICC saw fit to issue an arrest warrant against Putin that was for invading another country and and that's an issue but the difference is that no one is asserting not even the ukrainians are asserting genocide whereas here we have this situation that is so extraordinarily um significant and and I think the his history will shake its head in wonderment for decades to come how the Israelis and the Americans work themselves into this horrific dead end well Richard said that he doubts that uh uh anything is really going to come of this well what could come of this what should be number one should Israel be excluded from the United Nations this is a Israeli policy Netanyahu and the others who are charged are acting on behalf of Israel with the support of Israel's population number two uh should there be trade sanctions against Israel uh against uh to prevent turkey from supplying it with the oil that it supplied for against the United States for supplying it with the bombs that uh and armaments that Richard's just mentioned uh and in fact should the United States be sanctioned against this uh against its ability to vote uh in the security Council to prevent any United Nations sanctions from being done uh what Israel has done is an attack against the entire principles of the United Nations which uh Netanyahu claims are barbarism and anti- itic how can it continue to be a part of the United Nations protected by the United States and the security Council without these actual actions being taken and just moving to the conflict in Ukraine we had a new escalation the Biden Administration has decided to let Ukrainian use attacks and again us missiles against Russia this was the first time I talked with Ray MCG the other day he said that even it seems that Pentagon didn't know about this decision it's unbelievable what's going on right now in Washington do you understand Richard what's going on and why they have decided to do that right now well again I I obviously have no inside information whatever I'm dependent on what I can get from the mass media um and and trying to figure it out so this is just my response to your question let me dispense with one argument that is being put forward by the United States and it is so Preposterous and so lame that it kind of makes the opposite case from what it intends this has to do with the mysterious collection of North Korean soldiers now this is a classic case of putting out an idea in order to cover something you're doing with some kind of plausibility that might make naive uninformed people think that there's something equivalent going on and the argument has been put forward the escalation is really the decision by Russia to bring in North Korean troops and so therefore another escalation from the other side is warranted okay I don't know the exact number of Russian troops involved in Ukraine I don't believe anybody else does either but let's take a a widely used number and that number is 700,000 U Russian person El somehow involved the initial story and it has never been changed by the Pentagon the initial story about North Korean troops was 10,000 North Korean troops okay you do not have to be a military strategist to understand that if you're a country committed to a war with 700,000 people it is not a significant escalation if it's even true that there are 10,000 North Korean troops unless you know that it's actually a much much larger number and if you knew that why wouldn't you have said it why wouldn't you have made a point of it even now when some people having realized how bizarre it looks to claim that it's an escalation to add 10,000 troops to 700,000 troops which is Trivial as a military move okay there you are you revealed you made it up you started it a week or two before this decision was made uh and the planning for this decision was made long ago because you had to have those missiles in place and that's a whole long operation that they must have undertaken all right given that now what's what do I have left here we have a a president deemed so incompetent that he had to abort his race for president he had to drop out because he wasn't fit to run let alone serve and now he is on top of that a lame duck he he's out he's done how in the world do you take a world class risk like this everybody's now waiting for what the Russian response will be to this okay why would you do that that that is grotesque and from everything we can see Mr Trump either wasn't informed or is implicit and I don't know which it is and we'll see and I probably wouldn't believe him no matter what he said anyway nor will at least half the world so and and each day that goes by it's obvious he doesn't know what to do because he's not doing it it's a risk it's a risk of nuclear war it's a risk of of heightened conventional War I noted that yesterday in Kiev the American British uh and I believe French um embassies were closed and the explanation was given they're fearing a missile attack from Russia on those headquarters since Putin did say if you do that we will consider it an act of War toward us by the United States and Europe why would you in your your lame duck last two months having the whole world see that the the people of America judged you incompetent to finish running for president and then voted against your vice president in the election you have no right to behave like this this is an amazing arrogation to the United States of the the right to do this and in my judgment this is a lame duck let me underscore lame forget the duck this is a lame Act of the neocons around Mr Biden having lost the war there to inflict more damage on Russia because that was the fantasy in their minds from the beginning as the statements early on by Lloyd Austin and by the President Biden revealed weakening dismembering deconstructing Russia was the fantasy of what they had in mind is the Fulfillment of the legacy of the Cold War that isn't even there anymore these are signs of people behaving bizarrely and if you put them together with the circus clown collection of new cabinet members announced by Mr Trump then the notion of the United States as a rogue state in the world spinning out of control has just been given enormous greater legitimacy around the world and that ought to worry because you put that together with an arrest warrant for Mr Netanyahu and the symbolic direction of how things are going or to worry anybody who isn't lost in a bubble of self- delusion well go on go on when Richard uses the word lame duck what is a lame duck it means he only has two months to go in office that means whatever you're going to do do it now before Mr Trump comes in the fact that the excuse me the fact that the embassies of the US and other countries were closed meant that the United States expected and wanted uh Russia to respond in a similarly proportional uh way uh that would justify the United States uh escalating and dragging all of NATO into the War uh the re why would they do this well it's because Mr Trump has promised to uh end the war and they want want to prevent that uh they want to make it impossible for uh Trump in January to stop a war that they want to go on a year two year 10 year to constantly be a drain on the Russian Empire Uh Russian uh on Russia in the illusion that uh this war is actually draining Russia's resources and that Russia can't afford it so I I can just imagine uh what uh is going to happen uh when uh president Trump P takes power if Russia is doing what it appears to be doing saying well it's true that you're attacking us with missiles uh we know that they're not really Atomic missiles uh we know that you're trying to Goat us into something and play upon our fears but unlike you we're not projecting our fears we're going to do uh uh we're going to use Conventional Weapons to continue to uh knock out your electricity grid and to make it uh as uh difficult as possible for you to actually wage uh a war we think that by the time that Trump takes uh uh office in January uh the Ukrainian Army will be decimated uh in the literal sense of decimated it it uh won't have a fighting force anymore so you can imagine what Mr Trump is going to do uh he said on his first day he's going to try to end the war uh we don't know what his plan is but I think it's uh he he's already said uh what it is stop uh call have a ceasefire uh make some agreement as to who gets uh what land uh but not to go forward with what President Putin and foreign minister lavro said they really wanted they must densify Ukraine they must re roduced democracy with real elections not under uh the Nazi control uh but under U uh actual uh Democratic control and all of the opinion uh statements in Ukraine say the people want peace because if their sons are drafted their brothers or friends are drafted they're just going to be sent to the front to be killed uh so I can imagine uh what President Putin's uh response is going to be to Mr Trump uh he has to worry about the fact that uh when somebody tells uh Mr Trump well you know we can't do your plan we're rejecting it that makes him lose face so I can imagine how they will handle it diplomatically they'll say oh thank you president Trump uh you may be glad to hear that you've made precisely the same terms as we've made uh in our proposal two years ago in 2022 it would have worked then but Ukraine uh and and Russia even signed it we signed off on what basically is your plan but Boris Johnson went to KV and told zalinsky that NATO opposed it so the past two and a half years have completely changed the situation uh and made uh your proposal you know pretty much obsolete for one thing U you can make an agreement but we no longer can trust the West we agreed to a ceasefire that used suggest NATO broke it and used the uh interim to make a prepare a great offensive that it had prepared for February 2022 that began by shelling civilian areas in donet and luhansk and uh that forced us to protect our Russian speaking population uh that was being treated as non-citizens even so we uh made an agreement uh to try to uh settle things uh but as much as like your proposal how could you even get it through Congress uh and if you did how could you get the CIA and the military to obey you you've already appointed a uh uh a a new secretary of defense that is going to fire the generals and the colonels in Afghanistan who refuse to follow your directions uh that they should U withdraw from Afghanistan so we rush s are looking forward to you're cleaning out the CIA the Department of Defense the FBI and the Deep State uh that did so much to undermine you in your first year term of office so we'll be glad to help you uh to explain to your electorate that uh uh the NATO countries of how Biden Sullivan and blinkin made obsolete the quite reasonable proposals that you're making in principle I think that'll uh that's what's to happen on day one I wanted to add a piece of information that may not have caught your attention but it caught mine this last week literally a few days ago the latest Gallop poll and remember Gallop is an American company uh closely connected to American institutions it has been regularly polling the Ukrainian population on its attit ude towards peace and War and it announced this last week that for the first time a majority over 50% I believe it was 53 or 54 some number like that are in favor of peace and negotiations with Russia so let's real be clear the same time that the Galla poll indicates that a majority of the people of Ukraine whom everybody knows are the major victims of all that has gone on here not the Americans not even the Russians the ukrainians now a majority wants peace and at the same time the United States escalates the war increases the risk of the opposite of what the majority of the people in Ukraine want you know when this story is written these details will be put together and everything Michael just said about get in what you want to do before you lose office shows that they their connection to the notion of doing what democracy would suggest serving the people the majority of the people the majority of Americans never supported the Ukraine war and they certainly don't now that's one of the reasons that Mr Trump got elected now the ukrainians don't want the war you know who wants the war Jake Sullivan and Joseph Biden and that alone ought to make the internal you know the international criminal court think again about H why pick Mr Netanyahu without the support of Mr Biden Mr Netanyahu couldn't have done genocide on anybody but his household pets and just moving to the G20 Summit here in Brazil when we look at G20 lot of countries are participating in this Summit and it's so in terms of the countes participating in the Summit is so important and there is a lot of potential and this institution but at the end of the day we see nothing coming out of this they were talking about the conflict in Ukraine in in the Middle East but at the end of the day nothing substantial coming out of G20 Summit what is the problem Michael let's get started with you what is the problem with G20 that is not able to do anything important in terms of the conflicts that we're witnessing right now wait what's the problem with Ukraine or with the summit with G20 with the countries okay I I think that uh secretary lavro made it very clear the problem for him he he raised the uh scope of what the discussion was all about and said we're really talking about a split of the world into two different uh uh almost two different civilizations uh and his statement is so strong and so extreme that there there the final paragraph of his speech uh I'd like to read it and walk you through it and talk about it he said clearly the West is too smart for its own good it appears we need to create a new category to describe a nation's economic condition once developed now declining nation that description defines most of the neoliberal West that are infected with a neoliberal pathogen in the in the Declaration the point 80.5 opens with the following quote we note good prospects for a soft Landing of the global economy although numerous problems remain blah blah blah and a number of downside risks are there but uh lvov said that outcome is based on the fact that the global majority is growing at about 4% while the remainder is at 2% a number in my opinion quite uh low and uh he what he adds now is very very important I can generally be stated it can generally be stated that economic rents are a very tiny proportion of the global majority's economies while it constitutes 10 to 25% elsewhere which represent costs to these economies not productive income the neoliberal disease now that's just what we've spoken about on earlier broadcasts Nima when we've said that most of the American economy isn't production you since 2008 90% of the American uh economy wage earners their standard of living is gone down we talked about this last week the uh 10% of the population the the creditors uh the bankers the real estate people the rtier interests all of the wealth that's gone up has accured to just the 10% and their wealth is counted as an increase in GDP so act if you look at the GDP without fictitious Capital uh payment to the banks is not a product payment of rent to the landlord is not a product when uh hedge funds uh Gamble with computerized trading uh to make money uh that is not really a product when you take out the fact that almost all of the growth in the US economy and the European economies have been not a product but payments to the financial real estate and Monopoly sectors then they're not growing at all uh so that means that the only growth that's occurring in the world is to the global majority and what is the United States going to do uh when it loses power that was a topic of our very last show and the fact is that now you have uh lavro and the global 20 people realizing wait a minute we don't want to be like the United States uh like we used to want 50 years ago uh when it the US seemed to be successful we want to be not like the United States we want to create our uh entirely different institutions well that's what sort of disturbed me at the beginning of the show when you quoted uh what China is using the uh the uh money that it's uh borrowing from Saudi Arabia for uh the China wants to help bail out the third world countries from the bad debts that they were taken on as a result of Direction by the international monetary fund and the World Bank that didn't help them grow that helped them shrink that helped them financialized their economies in the same distorted way that the United States was doing uh that uh I think uh China and uh the G20 should have said uh we're not only rejecting the US European model were uh rejecting the residual the results of this financial neocolonialism and just uh wiping out the debt and from here on we're only going to take on productive debt for things like the Belton Road initiative I think you had some quote some statements on that that you wanted to segue into yeah um what I what I'm about to say is consistent with what Michael says it just comes at it from a different angle you know in mathematics there's something called if you have a functional relationship an inflection point when the direction of change changes itself and something that's Rising begins to start to fall I think the the the the lameness the inconclusiveness of the G20 in its official statement not so much in lavrov's comments but in it its official communic at the end is a reflection of an inflection point that organization is Riven it is the place where the decliners and the risers are mixed in together and they can't agree on what it is that they are doing and and we see that everywhere and for me the key statistic is if you add up the gdps I understand GDP is a very crude number it misses a lot but it's one of the few measures of a of a footprint that we have if you add up the GDP of the G7 the United States and its major allies and you add up the GDP of the bricks and by that I mean you you have your choice the first five who started it the 11 that they grew to a year or two ago and now the additional 13 that came on at at Kazan but even if you only go with the first five they now have a larger aggregate GDP than the G7 I mean that hasn't that's never been true before and the Gap by the way they crossed the lines literally crossed in the year 2020 so we are already now four years Beyond and the Gap is getting worse that is the GD aggregate GDP of the bricks is rising if you add the newcomers to it Rising even faster and that of the G7 is falling it's falling and they're more and more behind and without all the adjustments Michael's right you know GDP you know as we teach our students in the University misses a lot never counted you know the difference between the woman who works at home in a conventional household and where she's not counted as a GDP but if she gets divorced and has to take a job doing the same work in a restaurant or somewhere else she is in the GDP all of the adjustments will not erase the fact that the the global World economy is now split the dominant role play after World War II until the early years of this century is over they had a good run 70 years 75 years as Empires go not at all unusual there have been some that have lasted longer and some that lasted less so here we are and it's over and what you're watching whether it's in Israel and its isolation or in Ukraine as the desperate escalation in the remaining weeks of a lame duck etc etc I think these are all symptoms signs measures of this shifting World economy and and and I want to stress it in another way every sign virtually every sizable Corporation in the world American European Chinese Japanese is now recalculating their strategy and you know what they're recalculating the changed World economy what currencies they're going to deal with where are they're going to Source their inputs that they need where they're going to look for the growth of their markets how they're going to manage all of that what arrangements for credit they're going to undertake everything is changing you when you had a certain kind of national need you went to London or Washington or New York now you still consider going to those places but you're going to play them off against the deal you can get in Beijing or New Delhi or or sa Paulo or wherever else you end up going these are different everybody is Shifting and changing and in that process you're watching the American government which is also adjusting but it's adjusting by trying to hold on and that's a contradiction you can't hold on if the whole world is changing yet it wants to hold on and what the United States is doing globally should give all of us a big clue as to what is happening inside every country particularly those countries that are declining the G7 the West the Collective West including Japan including Australia New Zealand and all of them they're in those countries the corporate Elite the the the rich the 10% at the top who own the stocks and who run the companies they're trying to hold on in a decline and what that means to the degree that they have the wealth and power to do it it means even greater suffering coming sooner for the middle and the bottom because the decline isn't shared equally of course it isn't and they have more power inside their countries to hold on than the United States has internationally to hold on so we are watching a growing desperation both in the ranks of American leadership and in the Elites in every country because their the ground is under underneath them last week in the parliament of New Zealand the 20% of the people in that country New Zealand who are mayori who are the indigenous people of that country disrupted the parliament would not let business go forward because they're trying to change internally the deal between the settler Colonial community and the mayori community which was established by Deals they both signed years ago and the whites now want to change the rules and the mayores are saying no no no no no no no no you don't do that and we won't let it happen you're what that's not so different it's not yet at that stage but it's not so different from what the Palestinians have been trying to say to the Israelis I mean and you can stop one or another of these processes you can slow them down you can deflect them but the larger picture both internationally and inside each of the countries and for that matter each inside each of the corporations is a process of adjustment that is going to show up in all of these conferences going nowhere and when when you look for some meaning where does he find it he finds it in Russia for whom all of this is a step up given where they've been since 1989 Michael do you want to add something well I think that uh you mentioned before the show uh about Saudi uh what's happening in Saudi Arabia's borrowing uh can you describe that and then I'll comment on it sure um normally for many many years there's been an arrangement in the world economy very important uh for how to handle transactions in oil oil being the major energy source that replaced coal and wood in the history of Western Well the history of the globe to be blunt okay so for much of the last century oil has been the Key Energy Source once oil was discovered to be located disproportionately in the Middle East and within the Middle East disproportionately under the sand in a country called Saudi Arabia a country created to get to manage the oil in that country they've had an arrangement oil is bought and sold around the world uh and paid for invoiced in US dollars so if you're Nigeria well I shouldn't pick that if you're Kenya and you buy oil somewh you pay in dollars if you're Luxembourg and you buy oil to heat your homes in the winter you pay in dollars okay much of that money ends up in Saudi Arabia because they're the overwhelmingly dominant source of oil not the only source but a dominant source and so the question was Saudi Arabia in working out this architecture of international trade what is so Saud Arabia which is you know a place in the desert what is it going to do with this Global Avalanche of dollars that is coming to this place and because of the dominance of the United States coming out of World War II the solution found was known as the Petr dollar system and what it meant was the world would pay in dollars a huge portion of those dollars would end up in Saudi Arabia and other countries Kuwait Iran and so on and Saudi Arabia at least made a commitment to recycle to take those dollars and lend them to the United States government to purchase us treasuries with that to lend the money to the United States so literally think of it this way the United States as a major purchaser of oil would send it dollars out they would buy oil and the the Saudis would then send the dollars deposit them in bank accounts in New York City they'd come home and it and you would have less of a disruption of the world economy and the central role of the United States it also meant that the United States could send all over the world green pieces of paper called a dollar which cost absolutely nothing to make and the rest of the world wouldn't use the dollars to buy American Goods because they needed it for something else to buy oil to conduct their trade so it was a subsidy to the United States the world sent its produce here for us to consume and we sent them little worthless green pieces of paper which cost nothing to produce it's a subsidy to the standard of living of this country okay what happened this last week was that somebody arrived in Saudi Arabia who wanted to borrow dollars and it wasn't the United States government which always does that that's what Petro dollar means it was the People's Republic of China they had a bond issue $2 billion worth a new thing they hadn't done this before to borrow dollars in in Saudi Arabia Saudi Arabia is not a major place where bonds are bought and sold that's usually done in London or other world capitals Why in Ria because the Chinese have brought Saudi Arabia into the bricks they are now a partner and this is a plan whereby a number of things are accomplished Saudi Arabia has a new customer for its dollars it doesn't have to send them all to the United States it can diversify its trade deals in just the way its participation in bricks was intended to achieve so it's another brick of the bricks structure number two the Chinese being a very wealthy the borrower don't have to pay the premium that any other third world country would have to pay they would have to pay a much higher interest rate to borrow compared to the US Treasury because in the world capitalist market for the last 75 years the safest way to hold money or wealth is in us treasuries they're considered the obligation of the biggest most powerful most secure place the Chinese were able to borrow at one or two points that's a tiny difference from lending to the United States and so what the Chinese are doing and they're playing the role of intermediary they're borrowing dollars at a rate very close to the United States Treasury the lowest in the world and turning around if I understand the intention here and at this point I'm get in I don't know what the Chinese are going to do with the money the dollars they get but since they already have 7 or 800 billion dollars worth of dollars that they have lent to the US Treasury which I'm assuming everybody knows they're not going to do that that wouldn't make a whole hell of a lot of sense so what are they going to do my guess they're going to go to the 50 to 100 countries that are part of the belt and Road initiative and that are suffering under the dollar debt that they have accumulated and say if you went to borrow to pay off your old debt you'd have to pay you know x%c we're going to give it to you for much less than that we'll pay off you we'll enable you to pay off your debt by lower interest cost to us than you would have to pay to the west or they'll forgive it all together my guess is it'll be a mixture of both of those things that's part of what the and the Chinese will get something important in return access to a port access to minerals access to markets Source you know they're building their apparatus um and I want people to know that it is happening more under the radar of what people see than it even is above we can see a lot of it going on and there's twice as much going on in these little deals that are changing everything last thing this means that Saudi Arabia which together with Japan China Britain are among the greatest creditors of the United States and have been for 50 years aren't going to be that money is not going to be lent to Uncle Sam and that's kind of interesting because we're borrowing more money than we have ever as a nation our deficits are enormous now they may they may develop their their what their platinum coin or whatever game they're going to play but they're still borrowing money and they're still working a regime that depends on the government's ability to borrow money that it's going to have to pay more it's going to cost the treasury more because money is going to China used to come here I don't know how far that'll go neither does anybody else but these are huge straws in the win Mike I'd like to get into some of the technicalities of how this is happening uh I sat in uh with the white house uh with the state department uh uh when the Petr dollar uh Arrangements uh were being set up uh and had long discussions with officials Saudi Arabia never got any uh Petra dollars the Petro dollars were never in Saudi Arabia the uh payment to for Saudi Arabian oil was paid by the American oil companies into the US bank accounts of Saudi Arabia Saudi Arabia was told uh you have to uh you can charge as much as you want for the oil but you have to keep your money in the US for you can start with uh holding your uh US Dollars safely in US Treasury Securities uh but you can also buy US stocks and bonds but you cannot buy any controlling share of us companies we Americans get to buy foreign commanding Heights and foreign companies you can buy uh like uh minority shares so the head of Saudi Arabia bought a million shares of every stock listed in the uh Dow Industrial Average for instance uh spread it all about uh now uh it's it's been keeping all of these accumulations of a sovereign wealth fund uh not simply in treasury bills but in spread out into all sorts of primarily us uh but also other NATO Securities now we come up to the fact the important point that uh you started uh with uh that uh China offers to borrow dollar what is the effect of this well we know China doesn't need dollars uh but it can borrow at 1.2% which is hardly anything uh is you pointed out uh how how will Saudi Arabia uh raise these dollars it will draw down its accounts in the United States it will sell treasury bonds uh and why would it be doing this uh in effect the liability that the United States had to Saudi Arabia is now replaced by a Chinese liability to Saudi Arabia why why did Saudi Arabia do this why did it move its dollar claims out of the United States to China uh and why did China uh borrow dollars instead of something else well uh once Saudi Arabia decided to uh join bricks you can imagine all of the pressure that's brought by American diplomats against Saudi Arabia Saudi Arabia saw what the United States did to Russia's Holdings uh in Europe and the United States it simply grabbed it uh Saudi Arabia was reminded that remember the agreement that we made in 1974 that not keeping your Petro dollars in dollar form in the United States would be considered as an act of War that was told to me directly at the White House by the Secretary of the Treasury uh and uh that this is what Saudi Arabia is afraid of well if they're talking tough like that we don't want uh what America did to Russia to be done to us uh we do want to keep dollars because no matter how uh much trade by the bricks is in their own currency the dollar is still going to be strong uh because uh all of America satellites are using uh dollars and other countries owe huge amounts of dollar debts so uh now U the uh in the Saudi Arabians have begun to move their dollar Holdings out of the United States into uh friendly governments that are not going to Simply grab um their uh these dollars and confiscate them uh as the United States wants to do now the question is what is so is uh what will China do with these dollars uh I hope that it does not say we're going to pay all of your bad debts we're going to create a bonanza for uh the US financial sector debts that they thought would not be repaid debts that are selling for 20 cents 30 cents on the dollar they're going to be able to uh pay them at uh uh 100 cents on the dollar they will'll make trillions of dollars or at least hundreds of billions of dollars for specul and vulture funds in the United States I don't think China is going to do that uh there no need to uh let the uh it it can it can make a deal with the vulture funds uh and uh the creditors of third world countries to say okay uh these country the global South countries cannot develop uh cannot uh increase their investment and living standards if they have this financial colonialist Bur burden now what are we going to do uh either we can wipe out the burden and claim that they are odious debts and they're good leg legal reasons for saying this undertaken by governments that do not benefit the domestic economy that's the definition of ODS debts or they can say well we'll give you something and something's better than nothing let's say 10 cents on the dollar uh we'll use these dollars to pay them off and like the Brady uh Arrangements of the late 1980s wrote down the bad third world debts to a fraction of their values uh we've discussed on this show before um I think that they could do that but basically China is going to use these dollars which are still uh the acceptable safe currency of many countries to uh actually spend the money on putting together the belt and Road initiative uh it can't all be done with Chinese SL uh uh uh manufactured goods there are huge amounts of Machinery that have to be bought uh raw materials that have to be bought uh these dollars are going to be spent on the belt and Road initiative uh leaving aside something completely separate are uh Global South debts to the vulture funds u in American Britain uh they'll there's actually a use for these dollars uh and China will be able to maintain its current dollar Holdings which it needs in case there's a another uh George Soros currency raid uh on a bar raid on the Chinese Yun R&B uh to try to drive it down in price like they Soros did against England uh they want to make sure that they have enough dollars to protect themselves against any US dollar raid uh and the risk of holding these dollars has now shifted uh from Saudi Arabia uh to China itself and China feels pretty confident that the United States is not going to grab its dollars because China can say all right then we're taking uh in exchange uh all of the uh assets uh the dollar assets you have here it'll be a wash so I think that is the uh the the actual technicality the nuts and bolts uh of what they're doing it's very it's very important because it shows uh the uh desire for d polarization uh that is has been so strong for the last few years and especially since America's confiscation of Russia's money uh the England's confiscation of Venezuela's gold Supply and the United States confiscation of uh Iran's U foreign reserves way back uh when they drove out uh uh the dictatorship of the Sha so uh this the these are all the uh the background of uh what's happening and uh needless to say this is not something that is discussed uh in the uh open media not even in the financial Pages uh of the financial times or the Wall Street Journal uh it's interesting that uh the place that you get these discussions is on the internet shows like like Neeman show Michael let me ask a clarification what would prevent um China having borrowed this $2 billion dollar to go to a third world country I'll pick one Malaysia and say to them you go to your Bankers you owe x billion dollar debt and you say you're going to declare bankruptcy and no no debt repudiation not bankruptcy no no he repudiation yeah here's what they say they want of course repudiation that would be better but let's start they say we're going to declare bankruptcy and therefore you are not going to get anything okay at which point they say but here's a way for you to get 10% 10 cents on the dollar we won't declare bankruptcy but the debt will be sold by us us for 10% to the Chinese we will take the 10% pay you off so we have no longer any relationship to you and what we deal with the Chinese is our business not yours what's to prevent that wait who's going to who's going to buy these bonds who the the Malaysian government yeah says we're going to declare bankruptcy yeah unless you agree to the following we will sell these bonds we who's the Wii Malaysia the Malaysian government yeah we will sell this debt to the People's Republic of China how wait but what debt the debts held by the vulture funds Malaysia doesn't have any debt to sell the the debt is all owned by Foreign investors by the IMF the World Bank and all the vulture funds yeah no okay let me phrase it differently the debt is threatened by Malaysia we will declare bankruptcy we will not pay this debt whatever it is yeah so now the holder whether it's a vulture fund or a bank in New York is threatened with losing the entire deal yeah they've made a lot of money they made a lot of points when they cut the deal they've made a big interest for you know the usual they're willing to write this off because they assume they'll be able to turn that money around and recoup it in the next deal that they cut with some poor African country okay so they they are willing to write it all off then Malaysia says but wait a minute wait a minute we will offer to retire rather than bankruptcy you get nothing we will retire the debt if you agree to do that and we'll give you 10 cents on the dollar so you're going to get 10 cents or zero cents and the choice you make uh we are assuming you're going to prefer 10% okay where does Malaysia get the 10% answer it borrows that money from China which has the dollars because it borrowed in Saudi Arabia so China becomes the hero for for Malaysia by enabling them to unload their debt obligations for 10 cents on the dollar if they had declared bankruptcy they'd be hung up in court by uh Elliott and his fund for the next 10 years as you know very well and that can cause them various kinds of grief and they may lose the case in which case they' have to pay that's what happened with Argentina and some other examples that we know about so the Chinese have a good chance of finding countries who will be able to cut such a deal relieving them of their debt without a process from the hedge fund and the Chinese are the heroes and will get God knows what in exchange from the Malaysian government for making this deal available to them am I making a mistake here no but uh you're uh it's you're focusing on uh a single narrow country in pra the only way this kind of arrangement can be made is by an International Conference not only Malaysia but uh all of the different countries uh I had a long discussion with prime minister mahathir of Malaysia some years ago and uh we both uh discuss how can uh uh M there in Malaysia get a a group countries uh to go through this so I can assure you that their attention all along is to say uh our problem uh is that we have uh owing these bad debts that have been uh given to underdeveloped them is a universal problem felt throughout the global South countries let's have an an International Conference is the only way to resolve the problem that you point out of the uh uh the vulture funds uh that happened to Australia and an international uh the international laws have been changed since uh the argentinan fund uh against uh the uh the corporate Raider that you've uh mentioned the uh the new international law say that uh if a majority of third world global South Bond holders agree on the renegotiation then uh the minority Partners uh the real vulture funds uh Paul singer uh and his gang uh have to go along with it they have no ability to hold up uh the in agreement that uh the majority I don't remember if it's 75% or 80% agree with the solution uh you say can only be done on an international scale and that's good there should be an International Conference about this because look at the benefit that China will have for this International Conference will throw open the whole distinction between uh the uh the global majority's plans for growth that are used debts to grow as opposed to the Western idea of growth we're going to lend you money that we know you can't pay and the uh we'll force you to sell off your raw materials your your mineral rights your oil reserves your public utilities to us off for a song uh that we can then turn into monopolies and raise the prices and make and your economy forever that's the issue that will be thrown up in an International Conference uh so uh China I think will politicize this idea especially if it talks to Malaysia okay and anyway I I I find this fascinating but Michael and I would because we've had to deal with these issues uh he in practice and me in my analytical work but the bottom line I don't want to lose the the the the big picture these are all symptoms and signs of a shift in the in the world economy uh bricks is part of that every step that might take us closer to the kind of International Conference to relieve the debt which has been in the air for a there movements around the world to forgive the debt to cancel the debt to Jubilee the debt lots of it's in the air and it's becoming it's coming closer not as fast as many would like but it's coming closer and I think you're seeing that in all of these little little adjustments and little moves the United States ought to be worried if if Saia Arabia is not lending to the US but lending that dollars somewhere else not only is the question where is that money going to go and what is it going to do but it means the United States doesn't have the borrow power that its deficits require it to have and it's not that that this necessarily goes in a particular direction but it suggests the kinds of renegotiation of world arrangements and people should be under No Illusion the power and The Prestige of the United States that came out of the end of World War II when every other potential competitor was wiped out Britain France Germany Japan Italy you name it destroyed the United States absolutely on top was able then in Breton Woods in the IMF in the World Bank to construct a global World economy that prioritized benefits flowing to us corporations and dribbling down or if you like trickling down to the American economy as a whole all that is now over some parts of it more some parts of it less the dollar is still important but nowhere near what it was the Petro dollar deal is still important but nowhere near as much as it was and I could keep doing that and repeat repeating the phrase the nowhere near as much as it was that's the measure of the decline or if you like of the reorganization of a world economy not built around the United States and it means that for the United States the central question is how are you you the American people and government and how are you going to relate to to respond to the changing World economy are you going to Rattle your sword are you going to be militarily active now that your economic role in the world has shrunk and your political role has shrunk you're isolated with Israel as your companion you want to then rely on your military because it hasn't Shrunk the way the other parts have yeah but that's very dangerous isn't it in a world of nuclear weapons the portion of the world's population represented by the people of the bricks is now well over half the people on this planet the percentage of this planet represented by the American people is 4 and a half% over 50 four and a half even add all the G7 you're not close these are realities you can't dance around pretend around or bomb away it won't work the real question then is not whether but really when are you going to sit down with the Russians and the Chinese and all the other players in this game which includes the whole Global South especially now and work some Live and Let Live arrangement for the world in which the United States and its allies will have to accept a lesser role than what they had after 1945 well that's the optimistic picture otherwise it's a fantasy otherwise it's the same fantasy as imagining that the Russians will sit down with the west and give back Crimea and those areas that they have now fought and died for it's not going to happen and it just stretches out horribly and a big expense to Russia but it's a fantasy to think that in a world changing the way we've been discussing on this program for weeks now you have other options and relying on your military is self-defeating yeah well that doesn't mean it won't be done no you pointed out that's what Empire why Empire is fall because because it's self-defeating yeah I can I think we can wrap it up for today because we're running out of time here okay thank you so much for being with us today Michael and Richard great pleasure as always okay thank you as well Neema you you perform a very important function having and distributing these conversations if I could add just a word if we're right if the changing World economy is having all the ramifications and impacts that what we've been talking about today illustrate then try to understand it by realizing that virtually none of this was a feature of the presidential election we just experienced that neither candidate had the courage the Insight the advisors to say here's what's happening in the world my fellow Americans and here's what I'm going to try to do to manage this situation to cope with it to to make sure you understand where this is taking us no no no no no we are in there pretending that it's 1966 and that we're powerful and dominant and we don't have anything to worry about we can have it a presidential race turning on matters about what toilets trans people can access uh and no disrespect to the importance of giving trans people their rights and privileges as well as everybody else but it is a it's an amazing study in the self blindness of a culture well it's not only the uh president IAL and politicians that haven't discussed it the uh mass media have not discussed it and economists haven't discussed it oh the AC academic world is as is as deserving of the criticism as anybody even worse yes worse there's nowhere in the academic economics curriculum to work out International balance of payments or debt at all that it's a subject that uh is as unpleasant today for the population as sex was in Freud's time that's right that's right thank you so much both of you thank you pleasure see you next week bye bye bye by
