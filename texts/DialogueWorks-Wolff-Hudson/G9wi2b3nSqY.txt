today is October 9 and we're having Michael Hudson and Richard Wolff to talk about what's going on in the Middle East and Richard and Michael let me show you a an article that shows that the spending of the United States the conflict in the Middle East helping Israel it goes to it it's almost 2276 billion dollar and in this graph you're witnessing that in 2024 if you look at this graph it's 17.9 billion dollar and directly to Israel and the rest would be the conflicts that the United States went to the Red Sea to help Israel and other operations in that region and here is what Matt Miller said to the Press when he was ask about this helping this Aid that goes to Israel taxpayers paid for almost $23 billion in the last year alone that's almost $3,000 for each and every Israelis so we have you have absolutely no leverage on no pressure you cannot tell them do this or not do this so we make very clear to the governor of Israel what um we believe that are the best outcomes along a number of different um uh vectors in the region but as you've heard me say before they're ultimately a sovereign country and have to make their own decisions yes but I understand but a sovereign country that received from American taxpayers that received $22 billion first of all that number that number is not correct conflates a number of different things no but it's not it's it's not correct it's off it conflates I don't have the exact number but if you look at the I know I mean this is the number they came out of yeah so what's the US government what does the US government think that it has given Israel since October 7 we give them $3.3 billion a year and there was additional money that was appropriated in the supplemental the reason it's hard to ask that qu answer that question definitively is want to there are different ways of looking at money that ISO there's money alloc and then noted for years educational organizations that have come up with estimates that have come up with estimates this building at least which is in charge of uh arms transfers at least many of them hasn't seen fit to come up with an update since July of last year yeah I just don't have the update I'm just telling you that number you can look at you can look at that number and see how it conflates a number of things including direct us military spending to combat the houthis attacking international shipping which is included in that number which is obviously not difficult to separate what has been what has been given to them post October 7th uh in terms of in terms of in terms of things that were not approved before then under theou stuff that went to them specifically for the Gaza operate and now Lebanon so it's it depends how you look is it the amount that's been allocated to them is it the amount that's been delivered to them is it amount that is going to be delivered no I know that's that's the point is when you ask the question it's a difficult one I don't have the numbers here at my fingertips obviously I'm just pointing out that the number that s have the numb some place the numbers were Brown University's numbers not mine and so on but you know it doesn't matter what the the actual figure is but we give them a lot of money we give them a great deal uh of Leverage you know they we we give them obviously a great deal of political coverage in in in the UN and many other places and so on and to suggest that you know this huge and lengthy partnership really does not exact any kind of Leverage with the Israelis don't you question that that's not what I said the the thing that I said is that we are a sovereign country with our interest they are a sovereign country with their yeah Richard he's saying that he doesn't answer the question question he says that Israel is a sovereign country how do you what's your answer to that question Iraq was a sovereign country when the United States invaded it Afghanistan was a sovereign country when the United States invaded it Vietnam was a sovereign country when the United States invaded it it didn't give a damn whether that was a sovereign country or not it didn't respect its sovereignty for one SE it just as part of the war in Ukraine it seized 300 billion dollars worth of Russian gold its sovereignty meant absolutely nothing come on the answer to talk about sovereignty is a transparent fakery as is all the mumbo jumbo about how to estimate the numbers the question was about leverage if you provide a lot of money the question was clear and it had nothing to do with quarrels about estimating the amount of money this is a government that wants the freedom to do in the Middle East what it has always done namely operate a colonial regime without telling the people of the United States anything other than fairy tale about respect for different religions and the importance of Jerusalem and other nonsense that future spokespersons at the state department will no doubt repeat in the same mumbo jumbo style of Mr Miller that we just saw yeah Michael well if Israel were a sovereign country it would no longer be an American Ally because the whole war that the United States is fighting not only in the near East but also in Ukraine is a war against sovereignty that's what this whole world war between uh the US and NATO countries against the global majority China Russia uh and uh other bricks countries are it's it's a war to make a unipolar us uh control to prevent the whole rest of the world being Sovereign so the whole issue of sovereignty uh is silly and obviously uh the if you look at where are the armaments of Israel coming quite apart from money these are American bombs being dropped on Gaza and on Lebanon uh these are American ships that are supporting it uh it it is American money that's also supporting it uh and that doesn't even account the Israel bonds uh by non-governmental authori so the whole idea of sovereignty is irrelevant you can look at this war against sovereignty uh and especially as against the sovereignty as Richard just mentioned Iraq and Libya it's against uh to use Israel uh as an American satellite to prevent the near East from becoming Sovereign in control not only of its own oil but in control of the export money that it makes from uh this oil pre also I mean just an additional word the United Nations allows Palestine to have a seat I don't remember exactly what the status is but they have a seat uh to participate in at least some degree and most of the or at least a large part of the world would assign quote unquote sovereignty to the Palestinians based on all of the historic Notions of what sovereignty uh entails clearly the United States does not respect the sovereignty of the Israeli of the Palestinians so there a once again this use of the notion of sovereignty is extraordinarily uh selective my goodness I mean for me the most impressive thing about the little clip you showed us was the fact that we live in a society where a collection of what I assume to be perfectly reasonable intelligent journalists sit there and ask such questions and don't quarrel about the Absurd refusal to answer and don't quarrel about the Absurd invocation of sovereignty but they allow the conversation to absorb many minutes of quarreling about the details of the statistics both Michael and I are economists we work with Statistics all the time if you do you know that they are Loosely constructed numbers that have a million qualifications about them and that if you don't know the details of how they are gathered and how they are assembled and how they are edited you really can do virtually anything with them you know there's an old qu statement among statisticians the statistics don't lie but the statisticians surely do because they pick and choose which ones to gather which which ones to assimilate which ones to edit this is childish manipulation and the thing that most impresses me is that the journalists they are complicit with this mumbo jumbo theatric and they oughtn't to be they ought to have a bit more of a spine a bit more of that part of the journalistic tradition which says ask the hard questions that these politicians are trained to evade and avoid well Richard's talking about the sovereignty of Journalism uh and uh I think we've talked before about what Sean kery said at the world economic Forum he said quote our first amendment stands is a major block to our ability to be able to hammer disinformation out of existence uh sovereignty for journalism is what Wikileaks did which is why uh it fleeter was uh imprisoned uh for so many years uh we don't have a sovereignty of the press anymore than Nations have sovereignty and that you could look at the whole uh part of the American Cold War attempt to prevent other nations from having political sovereignty is the attempt to make sure that the US has unique unipolar so sovereignty over the narrative is the Middle East War uh the Israeli War all about uh the captives that were uh made October 7th a year ago or I think they're now a few dozen or is it about the tens of thousands and hundreds of thousands of Palestinians not a word about the Palestinians uh captives in Israeli jails uh you again the narrative is all from a very strange perspective it's like the famous uh hirosa painting of a big tree in the foreground and the city far away in the background and a little tree in the foreground is has priority over everything else that's the news that we get from the near East Ukraine and the rest of the world not sovereignty and Richard can I ask a question the main question right now in terms of what's going on in the Middle East is the way that Nao is behaving right now and when you look at his behavior what's Israel's endgame under Netanyahu how we can Define that well I must say w with all regret and sadness uh I will tell you what I have concluded watching all of this over the last particularly this last year and I conclude by referring to a saying that has been raised by um Israeli leaders at least as far back as uh David benuron and that is to say that the whole story can be summed up by saying that the Jewish people a people without land were finally given a land without people in other words but that's a quote I I didn't make that up that's a quotation repeated many times from the Jordan to the uh Mediterranean from The River To The Sea a people without land I.E Jewish people were given a land without people notice the little move there the move at the end to suggest that people were given something that no other people already had even though everybody who's taken five minutes to look at the history of that part of the world knows that it has been densely populated for thousands of years by a whole host of people so the reality was it wasn't empty it's a little bit like what I discovered when I was a college just beginning as a college teacher and I had occasion to talk about the early period of the American economy but when we were still a colony and I discovered that a significant percentage of my students understood the Europeans who came here to have discovered a land without people which they then proceeded to inhabit moving from the East Coast across until they finally reached the Pacific Ocean in the west when I reminded them well it wasn't empty then yes they remembered from their western movies that there were these quote unquote Savages who were around somewhere but who became quickly disposed of well if you know the history it took centuries before you could her those native people that you didn't kill into the reservations they still occupy in significant numbers across the United States okay the Israeli story seems to me to be summarized and carried forward by Mr Netanyahu as exactly what I said they want to establish that the area we now call Israel Gaza and the West Bank are a land that had no people and is th therefore now to be settled by a growing Jewish population and the job of the uh Palestinians is to choose one of the following three options leave or die those are the options and the Israelis become the Agents of leaving or dying and they're trying both and they'll rely on either one of them to solve the problem to fulfill the idea that it is a land without people that can now be settled by the people who don't have enough Land by the way this notion of land hunger uh is a replication of what the Nazis called lean room to live the Nazis moved East in Europe to get it the Israelis move west to get it but that's what this is has become and it will take a radical change of the mentality of the Israelis to change it last point when you're an aggressor and you're also a settler colonialism which is what this is nothing is more common than to justify what you are doing on the grounds that you must do it because the Savages that's the people that are already there are intent on doing that to you and it doesn't matter whether they are or not you must tell that story because it justifies what you are doing and I'll illustrate it with a story and if excuse me if I've told you this story before but near where the University of Massachusetts is located is a town called Deerfield Massachusetts and it has an old part which is the colonial houses that were built there back in the 18 17th and 18th century and they have redone these houses to look in the way that they did in colonial America so it's become a tourist attraction it's known as old Dearfield and if you go there as I have done and you walk through the old village and you look at the reconstructed housing you will notice in front of each of them a plaque and if you read the plaque which tourists do it says things like here was the Jones family or the Smith family and they came in 1702 and blah blah blah and then on the night of the 14th of April the Savages attacked them and I remember the first time I saw this I said to myself without thinking much what a remarkable thing the Europeans come from thousands of miles away they take the land they take the coast they fish the water they attack the local people they push them off the land and they refer to them as the Savages what an amazing move it's the Europeans who were Savage who had the guns to be Savage with but you need to call them Savages because what you are doing is so Savage it has to be justified as the self-defense against Savages and so you call the other what you are in Psychology this is so common it's called projection and every psychological practi ier knows about it and tries to treat it but in our political discussion of Israel and the Palestinians we all pretend we know nothing about any of that Michael well what Richard has just explained uh is what really was meant by a land without a people what are people they're humans uh and the uh isra lead ership uh again and again has said that the uh Palestinians are not human they are subhumans that is exactly what the ukrainians are saying about the Slavic people the Slavic people are not humans the U the Islamic people uh populations are not human in both cases they're called subhuman and a different species and this kind of thinking goes way back to the United States States uh at the late 19th century uh they thought of the unit us leaders thought of America as creating a new civilization and that new civilization uh somehow uh in the 1930s they began to absorb Nazism and it was as if the new uh countries with their ethnicity was a evolutionary biological new species and the Americans were a new species the Israelis are claiming to be a new species Exterminating the subhumans so that they're won't be intermarriage like there was between the chromag and the Neanderthals 40,000 years ago so uh you you have that uh that treatment is exactly what was uh uh the feeling in the United States that I experienced that in the 1960s uh the Catholic church had sent me uh to New Mexico uh to discuss how to uh raise up the uh Indian tribes and there was a man from uh official from the U Bureau of uh Indian Affairs who began talking about the Indian problem and I jumped up and said uh to the Bureau of Indian Affairs the Indian problem is the problem that they're Indians and that's how the Israelis and the ukrainians think about everybody who's not them we're we're talk we're talk when we're talking about a group of political group of settlers or an America of in Empire Builders claiming to be a new species cleaning out the bio the biology of these inferior races this is Nazism uh and that's really what uh what the fight is all about and that's uh that's why we're in now a civilizational fight between uh the NATO Us West and its allies of liketh thinking people who treat their adversaries as subhuman so or as Biden says it's uh the Democracy against authoritarian or autocracy uh or the autocracy are considered to be subhumans a different civilization and all this somehow is uh genetically uh become a new species and what civiliz the rest of civilization the global majority is trying to say no we're all humans uh American at Sal I said no you are not humans that's basically the position in this uh new Cold War I yeah do you want yeah you see it also in in this very sad tendency I I cringe when I watch a a video clip of the president of the United States in this case Mr Biden referring to the leader of the People's Republic of China as a thug what are you doing what kind of childish behavior is this Mr Putin doesn't refer to Mr Biden as a thug he doesn't do that one doesn't do you don't see too many leaders even in private let alone on a public interview doing such things what is this demonization of the here we go it's they're all Savages so if you're disagree with the United States if your idea of a European security architecture which is what they're actually trying to figure out how are we going to be secure each in our national boundary without threatening one another that that's what they mean by a security architecture how are we going to work that out Russia has to feel secure Ukraine has to feel secure they have to be able to function okay that's a problem we will have disagreements we won't see it the same way will have to make some compromise but suddenly no no no no no no no no no no no we are the good and the noble and the vanilla and they are the terrible evil empire what is this this is not just a quibble about words behind these words lies what Michael was just talking about this notion that really this is a war of good against evil and in the name of the good you can do what Palestinians who know something about the Christian Bible like to remind us about all the times in the Old Testament especially when there are all these discussions about God telling people to slay this group and kill all of them and murder their children and whoa there you have already the beginnings of a justification yes yes I know the Bible is full of other contradictory sentiments about loving your neighbor and turning the other cheek and all the rest of it but if you cherry pick you can become the exponent of I'm good they're evil I am called to get rid of them literally there's a quote from a a a Israeli Defense Force person in the Press recently explaining to a reporter how good he feels when he's asked about bombing mosques and hospitals he looks at the guy and he says but we're winning we're winning wow he's winning he's not asking what he's winning he's just winning and that's the struggle of Good and Evil when you think like that and that in the name of that stuff we have 5,000 years of Slaughter and we'll have more if we don't outgrow it Michael let's here here comes the question that how we can with the situation that we're having in Ukraine together with what's going on right now in the Middle East and in my opinion if Donald Trump wins we're going to have a big fight between United States and China how can we make peace affordable for each and every player in this political International political Arena Michael you the only way to solve the problem in Ukraine is by War you can't have peace without War uh some people say that war does doesn't settle problems but sometimes the only way of settling a problem such as the US the NATO and uh Ukraine trying to attack Russia is by War uh and that's why you mentioned the costs of this war before at the beginning uh I think that the whole idea of what's happening in the Ukraine is the American planners said uh said look at what really U broke the Soviet Union's power it was a war Afghanistan it drained Russia they had to spend all of their economic surplus on Military and send their population to fight in Afghanistan finally this created such uh austerity Andover impoverishment that uh the the leaders of the Soviet Union themselves uh decided it didn't work they somehow uh expect that if the war in Ukraine is supposed to go on as long as it can not to be settled but just continue to drain Russia until its economic surplus is spent on fighting the war and the population uh says I I guess what the Russians were saying in the 1980s we want to have blue jeans like the Americans have we want a consumer society and we can't because uh it's a military Society so uh the uh the American idea in Ukraine is to spend as much as it takes from our side uh to keep the war going as long as possible and outspend Russia until the discontent in Russia uh reaches a degree where uh there you can bring in a new Russian yels into the whole thing well Putin is also uh strategizing and said well he is not in a hurry to just March in and end the war quickly uh in Ukraine by marching to the neeper uh and Beyond uh he's willing to go slow because there's something that he sees that is beyond the short-term cost of the military budget and that is the longer the war in Ukraine takes the more it's breaking up uh Europe uh you've seen the last three German elections where the anti-war uh parties uh beat the Christian democrats and the social Democrats you've seen last week's election in Austria again the anti-war party uh won and uh as we noted before the anti war parties today are on the right not the left uh but we're we're seeing this uh the idea of the real costs both from the American vantage point and the global majority's bricks vantage point is going to be the cost is going to be how is all of this going to end up what is the structure of the world economy to be and the fight in Israel and Ukraine is just a a sideline uh a particular uh chapter venue in this much broader war and uh the uh this is the the real way of looking at the cost is the cost and who's going to support what countries uh will the cost of the Ukraine war U essentially as Putin believes end up uh dividing Europe breaking up the European Union and Paving the way for in 30 years I think Putin said for there to finally be uh a restor of the German and the European linkage with the with Russia and the global majority by which time in uh his hope the whole world will be you know under a unipolar uh rule of law uh that's what how to think of the costs that uh we're undertaking now and what the war is all about yeah let let me come at this from a slightly different uh perspective that might be of interest to folks capitalism as a system has built into its structure an imperative to grow every capitalist understands that unless they can expand their business and thereby get their hands on bigger profits they run the risk of being competed out of existence by somebody who can and will do that and so they all have to grow and we know that this has become internalized by the political leaders of all capitalist countries I'll use the example that they teach in elementary school if an economy is like a pie and different people and different groups have different pieces if you grow the pie everybody's peace can get bigger and we will all be happy if you don't grow the pie then a growth in some requires a diminution in the others and then we'll be at each other's throats very old idea been around for centuries and in capitalism that idea together with the way capitalism Works means that countries with employers and employees and Enterprises that produce and compete in markets have a drive to grow that's why it's a national emergency if the statistics show the GDP isn't growing fast enough oh my God alarm alarm okay now let's stop and take a step back for ecological reasons and climate change reasons we now know we've got to stop growing it's threatening our survival the people of the world have already figured it out because the birth rate of our planet is now zero we're not growing anymore the United States Asia Only in Africa is there a net positive birth rate and it's shrinking there too okay now we have a problem that a long repressed part of the world the global South wants to have its standard of living be where it should have been two centuries ago uh they're not waiting anymore so they are demanding a bigger piece of the pie this of course threatens the United States because it can't grow the way it wants to because it now has a serious competitor China and the bricks is already a richer entity than the United States and the G7 okay here's then a solution we question don't everybody yell we question capitalism why don't we change to A system that doesn't have a builtin imperative to grow because it's killing us it's killing us e logically but it's also killing us because the genuine and deserved demand of the global South for A Place in the Sun to raise their families have an education be decently cared for medically and so on is not going to be stopped with or without a World War all right so let's accommodate give them a bigger piece and rearrange in the way that socialists have always advocated to a much less unequal distribution of the resources of the world that way we can stop growing thereby meet our ecological danger and do away with a competition that threatens a war between a rising standard of living in the global South and a re-sharing that the rest of us here in the global North will have to undergo but we do so because it saves our planet and it saves us from war and that's worth it that's a plan but it requires the taboo be broken employer employee is not the only way to organ organiz the production and distribution of goods and services it's the capitalist way it was what we got when we got rid of Lords and surfs and Masters and slaves we replaced it with employers and employees but we can do better than that and we are at a point where we have to and so the issue of a socialism Beyond capitalism comes right back on the agenda it never really left it just needs a little goosing from those of us who see it to make it become again what we're all talking and struggling to figure out how to achieve well what Richard is described as occurring on a number of planes uh he talks about uh the drive of capitalism is to grow well that's certainly the Dr Dynamic of industrial capitalism but somehow that hasn't been the drive of the United States recently uh Richard how do you grow by out competing uh your Rivals you cut costs you uh uh you make things cheaper less expensively uh and better but the United States has been losing uh its race it's true uh last month uh the uh US GDP is going to grow and next month it's going to really grow because the Hurricanes uh hit uh South Carolina and now they're going to hit Florida that's going to be a big jump in GDP uh it's not going to increase America's dominance or competitiveness uh the American idea of growing today I think that certainly the neocon idea the Democratic and Republican idea uh isn't the kind of growth that uh Richard is talking about of capitalism it's a purely exploited exploitative growth it's the America can only grow by a rang the international economic order in a way that siphons off the real growth of other countries China Russia the global South and taking uh their economic surplus and transferring it to it to itself this is not a growth of part of the production sector of the economy it's a growth of uh the circulation sector of the economy marks through those two distinctions production circulation which is part of the distribution so the American growth has been parasitic the uh NATO uh us uh Unity Has It's Like A Parasite on the body of the global majority and they call that growth for the United States in Europe but it's it's uh it's parasitism and all of that as Richard just said we're facing the overhead of global warming and uh how do you prevent it well China has taken the uh the lead according to yesterday's Wall Street Journal in cutting way back uh carbon emissions way back coal and by taking the lead in creating uh both solar power and um Atomic power and so the US position is to oppose the importation of Chinese solar panels uh because that's not their philosophy and the oil lobbyists are now backing both political parties in the United States to make sure that any uh agreements like the Paris agreement that America signed will not be followed in in practice so you have the United States and Europe pushing the growth in pollution uh you have the green party in Germany saying the coal of the future is the uh the the fuel of the future is coal and cutting down the forests it's not oil it's not gas it's not power it's it's simply uh that and uh you achieve this uh Global uh fix up by by War so there the and somehow the anti-war party is supposed to be a key precondition a catalyst for all of this environmental change uh it you're having this bizarre uh conflation of ideas uh in the uh us NATO is opposed to the rest of the world as uh justice Richard has pointed out Richard do you want to add something no no and right now Michael in your opinion they when it comes to the Biden Administration the way that they're trying to it seems that they're trying to put some sort of pressure on Netanyahu but in your opinion why they're not successful why are they not successful in their attempts to put pressure on Netanyahu we had last time we talked here you said that the United States is running the show Richard I want you to comment on this as well I had a some sort of division between the analysts like you and Richard and other analysts some of you are believing that the United States is running the show in the Middle East and the other ones are thinking that is the Israeli Lobby in the United States running the show who's running the show with this endless Wars who's supposed to speak first I think we talked last week about this very topic uh Netanyahu is doing just what the United States uh is uh wants uh the dream of uh Netanyahu is the same dream of the US neocons war with Iran because if you can conquer Iran then you just close up everything between Israel and Iran you take up Syria Iraq uh you move down into Kuwait and the uh Saudi Arabia you take over the whole near near East uh so uh Netanyahu and uh the obviously Netanyahu is doing what the United States wants because the United States is giving it the bombs every week to drop giving it the money uh every month so that it can continue so what we're seeing is a good cop bad cop pretending United States doesn't want to be blamed by the whole world abhorrence for what is happening in Israel so it pretends to say uh that's not us uh we want to be the good guys we told him to be gentle when he dropped these bombs and not kill anybody but so he's killing people and uh we keep giving him bombs and telling him to be gentle with it well what can we do we don't have control him he's a sovereign country as You' played at the beginning so all of this is just a charade yeah I I would argue very similarly I don't see this great struggle between the two as anything more than poorly staged theater that is not yeah maybe for some people around the world it'll be convenient to believe that they can hold on but I would I would look at it in a long-term strategic way as follows for many many years now for basically the postor War II period This has worked very well this alliance between the United States and Israel for them it has allowed Israel to go from a poor largely agricultural Backwater to an important modern econom IC power to grow its population far beyond what it could have internally by itself [Music] um and it has allowed the United States to have right in the middle of the Middle East its own special agent dependent on it loyal to it I don't want to go over all of the murky ways that Israel play played strange intermediation roles when it came to the survival of aparte in South Africa when it came to the funding of the Iran contras in Central America the hands of Israeli operatives are present in many of those they were a loyal service they operate a very good intelligence system in the Middle East as they killings of naasa and others have shown us they're probably better than what the United States could do so that's a service they can provide with that the United States either couldn't or doesn't want to be caught doing so it's all the Israelis who get the bad rep but here's perhaps the most important the Israeli economy is dead it's finished it will take take a long long time to recover from what it is doing an enormous portion of its adult Manpower is busy in the military they're not working at their factories or their offices or anywhere else large numbers of people have left the country that's not reported on but I know it to be the case etc etc it is that Israel is going to be dependent on help from the United States economically enormously in the years ahead so the United States has a proven reliable agent who will need them in the future and is therefore not in a position to deny the United States anything that it suggests it once I don't see the United States having no leverage at as that journalist did the United States has plenty of Leverage and the reason it's not using the Leverage is there's no reason to or let me put it differently where they're using the leverage we don't know about it because they don't want us to and the Israelis dare not reveal the leverage if the Americans don't want it for all the reasons I've just given if there were no Israel the United States would look for an alternative agent in the Middle East and whoever you might imagine could play that role they've decided that such an agent if there is one would be less reliable less pliable that you would operate less leverage than the one you have does the Apec and the other domestic supporters of Israel inside the United States have influence sure they do Mir shimer Professor Mir shimer and his colleagues have demonstrated that for many years with countless studies but I don't think that would be enough anywhere near enough to explain what's going on this is an alliance which has served the interests of those who run Israel and those who run the United States and that's why they preserve it it's not to have nothing to do with leverage they have leverage that's why they preserve it and the only thing holding back the Israelis when they disagree with the United States is the fact that they know that that Leverage is there they're not going to take that chance the pro the biggest problem for the Israelis is the very large portion of Jews in the United States who do not support Netanyahu who do not support the policies now and the way they've handled that is to focus their foreign policy not on the Jews in the United States who are in the main unreachable by them but instead to go after the fundamental Christians to build up the idea that Jesus is coming back and that in order for him to come back the uh Jerusalem the holy land has to be in the hands of the Jews that's the Bible says that somewhere they fasten on that and so that's where the Israeli government has its film festivals and its exchanges and its tourism I mean that's all dead they've not earned any money on tourism for the last year and none is likely to happen but those are Christians that are going over there hosted by the Jews in a very careful campaign so that they get the support they need for Mr Biden to do what he wants to do this is an agreed plan by both of them to maximize the freedom they have to do what they are doing and the people who want to drive a wedge between the two of them unless you have something very powerful that's not going to happen there's too much that pulls them together for you to be you're certainly not going to shame them by saying that Mr Biden doesn't want you to invade and you invaded anyway as I as as Michael correctly says this is a theater this is a theat theer that is how they manage their the deal that they have it is like a good cop bad cop deal or any kind of deal where the two sides include in their deal the pretense they both contribute to that that deal isn't going on what Richard has said yeah recently we had finally just to finalize this session recently we had Emanuel macron finally saying something against war in the Middle East and he said that we have to control the arms and Aid going to Israel in order to make some sort of pressure to put some sort of pressure on Neo and and after that n responded to him that shamon you and how you can say that how can you say that and all of that how do you see do you think that in your opinion is the situation in the European Union changing toward Israel or we were still having the same old policy toward Israel and its attitude well let me speak a little bit to Emmanuel macron and I'll I'll quote uh the American filmmaker Michael Moore who last night when asked about the election made the follow ing sentence Donald Trump is toast that was that was Michael Mo's St he did correctly predict M that that Trump would win in 2016 so people should be careful before they dismiss what Michael Moore has to say uh I make no prediction so I'm not doing that um Mr C uh Mr macaroon as my my French family uh refers to him as president macaroon he he is in other words a cookie um he is toast there is no question he is political toast he was never a serious politician uh he proved that before he became president and just in case anyone missed it he proved it again while he was President he had the distinction of being a sitting president when earlier this year the national elections in France uh divided among the three major parties and his party the party of the sitting president came in third out of three that's his achievement Goodbye Mr mcon but he is desperate uh everything he does is go Guided by the last minute desperation of someone who has no base he is hated by by the old conservatives he is hated by the Socialist Party of which he was once both a member and a minister the man was minister of Education if I'm remembering correctly uh in the last socialist government he's hated by all of them because he is such a flip-flopper finger in the wind to see which way the politics wind is blowing so now he has his last desperate effort he's going to appeal largely to the people on the political right who are against Israel's position for a whole host of reasons and the people that are on the left who are against Israel's position for a whole host of different reasons and try somehow to attract them but they already hate him they do not trust him there is no reason I would like to remind you that less than a year ago Mr mro was the leading European politician advocating for European troops to land in Ukraine and fight alongside the ukrainians against the Russians prompting Mr Putin to make one of his statements that if other leaders in the west were thinking along these lines he wanted to make it Crystal clear that this would be an attack on Russia which Russia would respond to with any and all means at its disposal you'd have to be dead not to understand what he was saying now this man wants to stop killing people in the Middle East it's not serious and to the Chagrin not just of Mr mcon but of all French people no one is taking him seriously and in that he was helped because Mr Netanyahu not only chastised him for saying these things but went on to say and I didn't make this up I'm virtually quoting Mr Netanyahu that on the side of Israel is civilization and on the side on the other side is barbarism well that's our conversation a few minutes ago there we have it again Savages and the good people and Mr Marron in the mind of Mr Netanyahu just crossed over the bridge from the good guys to the bad guys and next we'll be hearing him referred to as a thug Michael what can I add to that I Richard's described the situation perfectly yeah all I could do is paraphrasing that's not much of a [Laughter] discussion thank you so much for being with us today both of you and hope we can keep these talks and great pleasure as always talking with both of you see you soon okay thank you same here bye-bye Michael
