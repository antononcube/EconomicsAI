why the German economy is not the leading it's the largest but it's no longer the leading economy because it's has a recession or something very close to it out of the nine major industrialized economies it looked at one will shrink over this next 18 months that is the United Kingdom but one country will grow more than most others and you will smile it's Russia but the country that grows by far the fastest is China and Russia because it's a major producer if you add Russia to Iran Saudi Arabia and the UAE you've got yours guaranteed supplies of oil and gas and you've got them now even though the United States pushes its maximum sanction capability to prevent it and cannot succeed you know the United States May invade the French country of Niger any any minute now that's the same that's not about Niger that's about G7 versus China and Bricks uh the war in Ukraine is not about Ukraine it's about the West believing it can weaken the Russia China India brics connection by a long stretched out War and the fact that you know millions of ukrainians are either dead or hurt or forced into becoming refugees etc etc that is what we call in the United States collateral damage it is it's too bad but nobody really cares at all such a miscalculation was made if you go back to February and March of 2022 you will find statements by American leaders all the way up to President Biden that the ruble would collapse that Russia would be brought to its knees all of it you know all of it wrong all of it wrong and as best I can tell they believed it then and they still believe they can do that to give him a bigger missile to give him a missile that goes further to give him better drones now they're going to give them F-16 fighter jets the problem more and more in Ukraine is they don't have the people what you are doing is you're grinding up Ukraine you are destroying that country but it's not clear you're doing anything else because one of the miscalculation I think has happened in this war in Ukraine before this war started they were talking about that GDP of Russia is less than Texas they were claiming that it's not that important for the world's economy and they're gonna crush the Russian economy easily what's the most important thing that they could resist this tremendous sanctions if you realize that the war in Ukraine is between Russia on one side and the United States and its allies the G7 on the other side then it's even worse because the GDP of the G7 is over 30 trillion dollars and Russia is one and a half trillion dollars that also is a short war the miscalculation of the United States and of G7 was not to understand the quality and the nature of the relationship between Russia and other countries in the world especially the four other brics countries you can now add the additional six bricks new members of bricks that were added last week so it's now an alliance of 11 countries okay what those countries did for Russia was to give it enormous extra economic power and that's what they used to defeat so far the West in other words when the west and what's important here by the way is not the military struggle the importance here is the sanctions the United States and Western Europe interfering in the Russian economy seizing their reserves held in the west there a currency Reserves Holdings of gold and dollars and so forth uh denying them export markets for oil and gas fertilizer and grain basically what happened is that led by China and India and above all India those countries purchased from Russia what they could no longer sell to Western Europe and the United States I mean it's a bit more complicated but basically that's what it did and secondarily Russia went around the world to many countries outside of brics and said to them you should not agree with the sanctions of the United States they are costly for you and they give you an idea that if the United States changes its opinion of your government this is what they will do to you so you need to say no no we're not doing this you can be neutral in the war between Russia and Ukraine fine you can prefer Ukraine that's fine too all we want you to do is to say no to the domination of the United States and Western Europe and the most important reality of this last year and a half has been that the vast majority of the countries in the world have agreed with Russia and have either continued to create deal with the Russians or remain neutral or whatever but not become complicit with the United States and Western Europe it is a very powerful statement that the world economy has changed every country in the global South every country now has two choices where before they had won if you want development assistance if you want loans if you want help from the IMF or the World Bank you have to go to Washington you have to persuade the United States that is no longer the case you have an option you can go instead of to the United States and its allies you can now go to China and its allies in the bricks they are together almost as wealthy as the West every year now the role of the West in the world economy is shrinking and the role of the brics in China in the world is growing that's been true for 10 years there is absolutely no sign that that's going to change next year or 10 years from now and therefore the writing is on the wall the direction is clear and that's why Russia was able to maintain its economy was able to maintain basically the value of the ruble to continue to function even while fighting a major war in Ukraine what's the importance of GDP at PPP because when we look at the 2023 China comes above the U.S in PPP it's China United States India Japan Germany then after Germany's Russia Russia is above Indonesia Brazil France even UK how do you see this what's the importance of this well you know for a very long time over 50 years economists have been debating whether the way to compare uh countries from one to another you use the regular exchange rate between their currencies or you use what's called purchasing capability or PPP purchasing power parity you adjust there are arguments on both sides but it doesn't matter because what what's important is the direction of change and the direction is the same whether you use exchange rates or you use PPP it doesn't matter yes you get a larger number for China if you use purchasing power parity uh and there's arguments why you might want to rely on that but it I don't think that's the important thing to worry about the important thing is that whichever way you measure the GDP of the G7 the United States and its allies is a shrinking relative to the GDP of China and its allies that was already true with uh the old bricks five nations it is even more true of course if you expand five nations to include now six more so you have eleven especially when you realize that those new ones include Saudi Arabia Iran and the United Arab Emirates which means that that part of the world now has more than enough oil to give it the energy it needs to continue to outgrow and out-compete the West in your opinion this diversity we have in bricks it can be a point of power point of weakness we know the relationship between Iran and Saudi Arabia they didn't have a good relationship now they are normalizing their relations and they join brics in we have India and China they're not they're not totally in line with each other they have differences they put aside their differences they know they have a common ground to to grow how do you see this well you know I am a student of Hegel and Marx so you will not be surprised if I tell you that it's not ever either you have a strength or you have a weakness it's always that you have both it's always mixed it's always to use hegel's phrase contradictory so yeah the bricks have a common program to develop their economic relationships to speed their own Economic Development and to do so by helping each other rather than continuing their subordination to the United States and the European West that's what they agree on and that's what they are now strong enough to deal with but you're right they have disagreements and differences India and China dispute territory in the Himalayan Mountains Iran and Saudi Arabia have enormous disputes that are deeply vetted in their different interpretations of Islam and many other issues but I want to remind you that when you look at the relationships inside the G7 they're full of conflicts also and it has to be understood that alliances are never something in which all differences disappear and if a politician says that you should not listen to that politician because they're not talking about the reality they're wanting to push you in one direction or another by the way they are talking and it is it would be wise for you not to to to go in that direction you don't have to choose either they're becoming stronger or they're becoming weaker they're doing both let me give you an example of something that is weakening both of them at the same time both of them use the employer versus employee economic structure that's true in Russia that's true in the United States it's true in the People's Republic of China and in every other one of them but there are serious conflicts between employees and employers Mark spent a lifetime explaining why those contradictions exist he called it the class struggle and he meant it to show people that the conflict between employer and employee will in Marx's opinion eventually explode that system the way the contradiction between master and slave in the end destroyed slavery or the conflict between Lord and serf eventually destroyed European feudalism so at the very least one would have to ask the question how are the conflicts or the class struggles between employees workers on the one hand and employers or capitalists on the other how are these struggles playing out in Russia China the United States Saudi Arabia or anywhere else that I would argue is a source of immense weakness in all of these countries one that the bricks are not addressing any better than the the G7 among the G7 there are a number of countries who consider themselves in one way or another socialist the leading political party in Germany right now Olaf Schultz the the chancellor he's a socialist he's been a socialist all his life the Socialist political parties and there are several in Germany are very powerful as political parties so the G7 includes socialists China refers to itself as a socialist economic system they say they are socialists with Chinese characteristics okay so you have socialists in both of them and you have very strong anti-socialists in both of them Okay so yes they don't all mean the same thing but that's another question the fact is that these are societies that have their own conflicts within them you may not know this but the president of France Emmanuel macron applied to join the bricks and he was turned down by the bricks okay so you got another complication in that here's a European who's very worried that if the world economy is splitting into two camps it may not be good for France at all to be identified in only one of the two camps they would like to be in both of them how is that gonna that's another contradiction that's going to be an idea that's going to occur to other Europeans Italians for example Germans for example Germany's biggest export Market is China does it really want to be forced by its Ally in the United States to cut off its relationship with China that would be very dangerous and very negative for the German economy it already is as I'm speaking to you this problem which is not yet acute is already part of the explanation why the German economy is not the leading it's the largest but it's no longer the leading economy because it's has a recession or something very close to it etc etc so I think you're going to see shifting weaknesses and strengths uh the outcome of this war in Ukraine will affect all of that it already is uh what's going to happen in the oil market now look um two weeks ago three weeks ago the international monetary fund issued its projections of economic growth in the rest of 2023 and through the next year 2024 out of the nine major industrialized economies it looked at one will shrink over this next 18 months that is the United Kingdom all the others will grow but they will grow one to two percent maybe one or two will grow two and a half percent maybe even three percent but one country will grow more than most others and you will smile it's Russia but the country that grows by far the fastest is China it's scheduled to grow between five and five and a half percent not two or one and a half or two and a half percent in other words the dis proportion between the bricks and the West continues to get worse and the mass media in the West do not give this anything like the attention it deserves this is a historical shift it puts the people who were colonies before in the stronger economic position than the colonizing countries in Western Europe and North America we've never had that before the decline of the British Empire in the 18th and 19th century gave way to the rise of the American Empire in the 20th century we are now witnessing the declining American Empire and the new emerging Empire which will either be Chinese or some multinational grouping around the Chinese and these this changes everything just like the passing of the British Empire did the passing of the American Empire will and the fact that Americans and Europeans who counted on that Empire for their economic wealth for their military security they can't do that anymore and that is going to shake those societies as deeply as the end of the British Empire shook Great Britain look the people of Britain became so desperate that they were willing to follow the worst fake politicians you could imagine who told them led by uh Boris Johnson who told them that their end of their empire and all their difficulties were because of Western Europe that is beyond words that's so stupid no people are that stupid but so they were desperate so they voted and they brexit you know we left Europe all that did which many of us told them was make their economic crisis worse which is exactly what it has done here in the United States we have demonized immigrants mostly desperately poor people from you know Guatemala or El Salvador or Colombia or really poor poorest countries of Latin America sending their desperate people North into Mexico and then to the United States at no time have the number of undocumented immigrants from Latin America amounted to more than 10 maybe 12 million people in a country of 325 million people to blame the economic problems of the U.S on the immigrants was the equivalent of the British blaming Europeans for their dilemma but when you see a population caught in a decline they cannot stop they become desperate and they follow crazy leaders Boris Johnson in England Donald Trump in the United States bolsonaro in Brazil and so on hoping somehow that out of this crazy person some solution will come because they don't see a solution anywhere else and no one teaches them that it has to do with capitalism that it has to do with the employer employee way of organizing your economy with the global division of the world in a new way now with the arrival of China and the brics you don't teach your your people to think like that you don't give them that way of imagining a future so they'll imagine a bolsonaro or a trump or a Boris Johnson until the collapse is so severe that they will reject all of that which is coming but we're not there yet the British are getting there but they're not there yet either how do you see the importance of this brick Summit considering these three countries Iran Saudi Arabia and UAE these three countries are big in the Middle East the most important countries in the Middle East with all the energy they produce well I think you see two things are going on one and this is you know as important as anything else one is a spectacle which is that China and remember China brought Saudi Arabia and Iran together many months ago so that they now have embassies in each other's country and the state of war between them has apparently been put aside the West never could do it the East did it nobody misunderstands what's being shown here both Saudi Arabia and Iran see a better future for themselves working together inside bricks than fighting each other uh in Iraq in Yemen or in any of the areas where they have conflict this means that the Chinese can go around the world and say we are in a better position to end war and bring peace than the United States and there's the evidence and the United States is unable to do anything about it at least not yet the United States believes it can squash the bricks overcome them undermine them divide them and it is trying to do all of those things but the bricks have been the object of American diplomacy economic Warfare military attack so you're not talking to people who are naive you're talking to people who understand very well how these things work and they are betting on the bricks now with reference to Iran and Saudi Arabia they are economies that depend on oil overwhelming everything else so you're seeing them decide that their oil dependency is better secured joining and building bricks then entering into relationships with the United States and Western Europe and it means that bricks basically has now solved its energy problem China was going all over the world Latin America Africa signing one deal after another in order to secure oil gas coal whatever they needed they'll still do that but they now have a close Alliance and Russia because it's a major producer if you add Russia to Iran Saudi Arabia and the UAE you've got yours guaranteed supplies of oil and gas and you've got them now even though the United States pushes its maximum sanction capability to prevent it and cannot succeed if you look closely and you study these things you'll discover that all over the world in many countries not just brics countries governments shipping companies are evading the American sanctions doing so every day and the United States government knows it and cannot prevent it look it's a change it's important to understand that this is like everything in in world history it's a mixture of material and symbolic shifts they're both going on but I think you have finally seen the revolt of the global South with the alliance of Russia and China I don't know whether you put them in the global North or the global South but you can see what's going on and that shift at this point looks irreversible so that the real issue becomes what are the other contradictions that can change everything that's why I gave you the example of workers against employers the old Marxist class struggle the old capitalism versus socialism that struggle is not resolved that struggle is now if anything more powerful because it's going on inside the G7 and inside the bricks as well and how those governments are going to engage with that struggle who's going to win that struggle look the United States which is where I live and work is now experiencing a more militant labor movement than we have seen in this country for 50 years okay what's that about where's that going to go when is that going to stop and in that struggle between workers and employers over unions the question of capitalism and socialism are also coming into the public conversation in a way we haven't seen for 50 years I don't know where that's going but these are not coincidences France has seen the eruption of its people against its government twice in the last decade the yellow vest movement before the covet pandemic and now and I kind of a another turn like that against macron and his government which is almost the same wow what is happening where is this gonna go and I think these kinds of questions are going to be as important as anything else as it interacts with the changing position of the United States and Western Europe relative to China and the brics the other two countries African countries are Egypt and Ethiopia one of the things that came to my mind why Ethiopia what's the importance of Ethiopia joining brics yeah it's a good question I also wondered about it Ethiopia is an extremely poor country but on the other hand it is an African country and Bricks is a little scarce on African countries it has South Africa but that's about it and um with Argentina joining Brazil you have a very huge presence in Latin America because of those are two of the most important countries and economies by every measure uh and they they haven't done that in Africa so I think Egypt and Ethiopia were some more symbolic um decision about showing that you want to expand with Africa that you will expand with Africa but that for the moment you pick two countries who are focused more on the Middle East Ethiopia is just across the water from where the oil is and so it's not unimportant strategically to control at least in some ways what happens to Middle Eastern Oil um so I think you're already seeing exactly what you would expect the maneuver you know the United States May invade the French country of Niger any any minute now that's the same that's not about Niger that's about G7 versus China and Bricks uh the war in Ukraine is not about Ukraine it's about the West believing it can weaken the Russia China India brics connection by a long stretched out War and the fact that you know millions of ukrainians are either dead or hurt or forced into becoming refugees etc etc that is what we call in the United States collateral damage it is it's too bad but nobody really cares at all you have to in my judgment you really have to wonder about Mr zielinski because agreeing to this is an agreement to the self-destruction of his society and I don't know how any leader does this it has happened they cannot get back to February 2022. yeah it's it's gone it's gone tremendous opportunity they lost in 2022 to solve the situation in Ukraine now it's all gone yeah well you know you have to ask yourself I agree with you but you have to ask yourself how and why such a miscalculation was made if you go back to February and March of 2022 you will find statements by American leaders all the way up to President Biden that the ruble would collapse that Russia would be brought to its knees all of it you know all of it wrong all of it wrong and as best I can tell they believed it then and they still believe they can do that now of course they can't get turned away because then they look like they did what they did which is make a terrible mistake and being politicians of the sort they are they can't uh they don't think they could survive that and they may be right they may not be able to survive that but they're taking a bigger and bigger chance because as best I can tell from the outside if I had to say who is winning the war it's more Russia than Ukraine and I don't see how that's going to end the United States keeps escalating with the military equipment but that doesn't seem to change very much uh so I I'm beginning to to see this as a kind of desperate political football which the Republicans Mr Trump may use to blow Biden out of the government and you know and who knows what happens to them you think with the level of financial support and weapons the U.S is sending to Ukraine how long they can continue this yeah the United States is running out of weapons it doesn't have enough uh to produce it doesn't want to produce a vast new quantity to ship to Ukraine that doesn't make much sense they've shipped already to Ukraine most of what they had that they can do without storage old bombs old missiles and all of that we already have an inflationary problem spending to build up war production would worsen the inflation that is too dangerous for them they're not going to do it so they keep escalating they give them a missile they didn't give them before to give them a bigger missile to give them a missile that goes further to give him better drones now they're going to give them F-16 fighter jets the problem more and more in Ukraine is they don't have the people you know you've used your trained military you don't replace them with bringing in young people and old people I mean they may think they're doing something terribly patriotic but they're not skilled in this the Russians have way more of a of a reserve they're a much bigger country they maintain a much bigger military for much much longer this is a diff this is not it's not a fight of equals and you know you can give them what escalate the weapons it's not that's not going to solve your problem the Russians are very good they have drones of their own they have mechanisms to interfere with the drones they have a big Air Force they know how to shoot down airplane I mean they've shown all of this you keep escalating because the previous escalations didn't do the job they're not doing the job now country has been gearing up for almost a year for this great offensive and it got them nothing really nothing at all it's so bad that even in the western press now in the United States and in Europe there are more and more stories that are clearly written by reporters and editors of newspapers who are wondering this is crazy this has got to stop what you are doing is you're grinding up Ukraine you are destroying that country but it's not clear you're doing anything else and while I don't think most people outside of Ukraine care that much they are not interested in being a destructive force for no achievable gain that that's even more worse than most people will find bearable and that's what's beginning to look like you know and they the effort to demonize Putin that hasn't gone well he's as popular as he ever was in Russia there's no perceivable movement to get rid of him the same is true for Xi Jinping in China and from Modi in India so I mean these are very different people they don't agree on many things but on D dollarization on diminishing the role of Western Europe and the United States they've agreed on that for 40 years now for the first time they can do it you're not going to take that away from them unless you give them something enormous which I don't even think the West has anymore did you see this GOP debate there is a new candidate called Vivek ramaswami and he's talking about let's let's get out of Ukraine because it's not profitable for us and go go support Taiwan to fight China well you know you have a group of politicians the leaders of the Republican Party they are no longer in a position to control their party they are no longer in position to do what they have done for a long time which would work out a comfortable deal with the Democrats to go back and forth now you have the presidency we have the Congress then in five years you have the Congress we have the all of this was nicely worked out by what you can call the center left that's a Democratic party and the center right the Republican over time as the economic conditions of the United States began to decline and that's now 20 20 years at least old it's really the new century is just bad news for the mass of people um they became increasingly upset their upset Begins by turning against the Democratic party why because the Democratic party was the party of Franklin Roosevelt it was the party in power that went further to the left than any political government before or since in the depths of the depression we created the social security system which is a national pension system we created unemployment compensation we passed the first minimum wage Act and we hired 15 million unemployed people for government jobs these things have never been done before and have never been done since most of what was done then has now been taken back taken away and the Democratic party was the party of the working man that was their slogan here so the anger of the working class went against the Democrats because they were the ones who were supposed to protect and to advance the interests of working people so in a system that does not allow more than two parties Democrat and Republican if the working class turns against a Democratic party they do two things they either stop voting which millions of them did or they look for someone among the Republicans who might help them and they become vulnerable to any demagogue who swears and promises he will do something for them Trump is the first one to do that in an effective way the one before who did it a little bit was Reagan but not enough Trump was did it much more radically than dragon ever did and promised a really new and different Direction why anyone believed him is a mystery he was a crook a liar you know a Playboy who inherited money from his real estate father was a zero nothing but he knew how to say what had to be said and so they went to the Republicans and the Democrats had a chance to try to do the same thing with Bernie Sanders to have a socialist left-wing pro-labor candidate the problem is that the Democratic Party since Reagan was so upset by losing the working class support that they turned begged for and got donations from the biggest capitalists in the country so by the time Trump arrives this is a political party that has lost much of its base in the working class and replaced it with a dependence on the money of corporate capitalism so they can't go with Bernie Sanders they can't go in a in a risky program of winning back to working class at the price of losing the money they need with which to run politics so they split Bernie Sanders and the young people on the left and Clinton Obama Biden in the you know the conventional Democrats uh and so now that's that's what you have and the the Clinton Obama Biden people uh destroyed Bernie Sanders as an independent voice not only outside the Democratic party but inside as well and so you have now this contest between Trump who's too extreme still for most of the American voters and Mr Biden who is too old and too boring for most of America because he seems to be nothing more than more of the same and the same is unattractive into this situation arrive no left-wingers because they saw what the established party did to Bernie Sanders and they don't want that to be done to them The Only Exception is a Marxist socialist named Cornell West who is running an independent candidate from the left and he will be saying the only things that make any sense in this situation will come from him he understands he knows and he has nothing to lose he has no chance to win but he has a chance to say things that will otherwise be carefully not said either by Trump or by anybody else then on the Republican side is a recognition that the Obama Clinton uh Biden are trying to destroy a trump by by having him go to court by throwing everything they can at him uh waging endless ideological Warfare against him uh not doing a very good job but they are trying but it means that anybody with a lot of money can now enter the Republican primary the way Rama Swami does in order to do that you need a lot of money which he has uh personally he has his own money um and you need to believe that the positions you take don't matter in other words you can say whatever it is you think will get you some attention because nobody understands what's going on anyway and they won't ask you questions because they don't know either what what what's to go on so he decided that since there are quite a few people doing this and by the way please understand many people run who have no interest in being president and no chance they're doing this because you get a lot of free publicity you are on radio you are on television for example there's a woman Nikki Haley the governor of the Carolina she would like to be famous and Rich and she hopes that they'll make her vice president the way the Democrats did as a kind of an attempt to get Women Voters that's why she's there she has no chance to be the presidential candidate everybody who knows how this done knows that and she knows it too Swami what does he want well he would like to replace Trump he would like to be another Trump without the negatives Trump has so for example he says he loves Trump okay that has nothing to do with anything the hope there is that Trump is eliminated that the Democrats succeed Trump has to go to jail and Vivid Rama Swami will then hopefully get the Democrat the Republican votes for Trump because you can't vote for Trump anymore and then you look around for the one who most looks like Trump this was the strategy of the other fellow the governor of Florida Mr DeSantis he did the same thing the problem was he did it early and so Trump all over him attacked him ridiculed him so he his strategy was stupid and he has been basically if not destroyed nearly destroyed yeah he's not what he's not growing in the polls no he's not growing he's awful you know he he's to the right on social issues he's worse than Trump which takes some doing and which is stupid because the American people don't they don't like that they really don't you know Trump lost by seven eight nine million votes it was not close none of it it was just childish you know he did the  but it's important to understand that you can in this country now say that you won an election you clearly lost because there are millions of people so upset about what's going on in the world that they believe it's being managed by some evil what does he call it the Deep State and so forth and so on that's a measure of people's desperation if you ever study the arrival of Mussolini in Hitler in Italy or Hitler in Germany it was to a destroyed bitter working class that that was willing to look in this direction because they were so angry at the ability of the regular politicians to do anything if Trump gets reelected it's purely that it has nothing to do with his Politics on Ukraine or anything else Americans most Americans could not tell you where Ukraine is they don't know they never learned they do not care they just don't they like the imagery that we in America are fighting to help a small country in Europe this this fairy tale is very pleasing and if it weren't a problem everybody would be in favor you know it's like helping the the little child in the school being bullied by a big child you know you help the little child to not as long as they think that's what's going on which the Biden Administration repeats 50 times a day they will be supportive but the minute there's a candidate who says to them they are taking your money making your life harder to support they'll turn against it in two seconds because it's there's no depth here there's no they don't know anything they don't care about it look half the people in the United States went polled are not aware that the current regime in Russia is not like the Socialist or Communist party regimes before 1989. they don't follow the news they don't know a leading senator in the United States Tommy tuberville from the state of Alabama when he was elected a couple of years ago gave a famous interview after announcing you know thanking the voters for being voting for him he said he owes it all to his father who fought in World War II against the Communists and the reporters had to tell him that his father fought against the Nazis not the Communists who were the allies of the United States this is a man in his 60s a product of American Education a senator has no idea of anything That's Not Unusual that's the norm and that creates opportunities for Mr ramaswamy to say one thing that he thinks people will like to hear give us money don't give money to the ukrainians that's really no different from what you see with white supremacy the basis of white supremacy here is saying to white people they're giving the money to the black people to the Hispanic people they should give it to you it's not fair yeah not fair has nothing to do with race it's just using the race to make people understand that something which they already feel is being taken from them and given to people other than them because no one's giving me anything this this mentality that's the political raw material now and Vivek ramaswamy is going to take advantage of that he's going to spend you know he's a billionaire so he'll spend 50 million dollars which for him is two or three percent of his assets and he will make a name for himself and he will get many opportunities to give speeches to get Awards this is an amusement for him and if he were to get somewhere and actually be a real candidate well that's the story of trump he did it as an amusement as well we are proud in the United States to be able to say we have the best government money can buy foreign
