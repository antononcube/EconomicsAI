hi everybody today Thursday November 14th and Michael and Richard are here with us to talk about what's going on in the United States let's start with Richard here is a video in which that Scott Basset it seems that he's going to be Donald Trump's new sec secretary new treasury secretary and he's talking about cutting this spending deficit immediately here is what he said and let me know what's your take on this I do it through excuse me deregulation uh energy dominance and repr privatizing the economy because we we've seen this massive government spending we had a 7% deficit to GDP which we've never had in peace time the or non-recessionary period so you know and we've got this Elon Musk cost cutting commission which you know over the past weeks months when I've been out uh talking to people in the campaign Trail uh the public is very excited about yeah go ahead if the public is as excited as he just presented his own thinking we're in deep trouble this man doesn't look like he's a person who understands excitement or can experience it but so therefore who knows what gave him the idea that people out there are excited let me Begin by by dealing with the particulars he just said but then make a general point if I can about the whole collection of people that are going to be in some way directly or indirectly connected to the economy and the problems of the economy so I'm going to begin with Elon Musk and efficiency why in the world would anyone UST Elon Musk with anything let alone efficiency what has he got to do with efficiency nothing absolutely nothing the number one thing for which This Man became famous was producing an electric vehicle okay let's look at that an electric vehicle why is an electric vehicle a wave of the future that could make him so wealthy that he could buy votes in Pennsylvania for Mr Trump how did that happen answer the private gas G powered vehicle has become so dangerous to the human race that finally it developed enough of a backlash come under attack why well let's see the private automobile is the number one cause of air pollution in the world so that everybody who cares about lung cancer empyema for children and all the other effects wanted something other than a gas powerered car number two it is one of the largest causes of death and injury every year in every country car accidents and truck accidents kill more people than the wars we fight they are a very dangerous way of moving people and goods and number three is a grotesquely inefficient way to move people if you know how most automobiles work they are driven maybe an hour a day and then they sit in a garage or on the street for most of the time this is not an efficient mechanism it is wildly inefficient and I won't even discuss how much of the world's resources rubber oil for the plastic metal go into these cars which are rendered obsolete usually in a few years okay clearly the world needed something better well we all know what something better is we all know what will reduce pollution what will reduce injury and death what will reduce the waste of resources and I'm not even talking about what this would imply for parking garages and the horrific real estate they waste the answer is and we've known it for decades it is something called mass transportation rail bus Street Railway Jitney lots of names for ways many societies have figured out in many cities how to move large numbers of people comfortable Clean safe mass transit infinitely better than what than what Mr musk gave us which is the same idiotic private automobile no public transportation at all now you can say what you want but it's clear what Mr Tesla did he found a profitable way to speak to the anxiety and the criticism of the private gas guzzling car a profitable way to get everybody to sell their gas powered car and buy an Al electric car but that isn't an exercise in efficiency it's an exercise in waste it's inefficient to do that now we can all keep our electric car in the garage 80 to 90% of the time until it is no longer worth anything because it's five or 10 years old and then we can go and buy another one causing us the same set of costs this is beyond inefficient this is very stupid but wait we know why because it's profitable it made Mr musk the richest per person in the world what could better symbolize capitalism that's how it works it makes some people wealthy and only the kind of president who we've just elected would look at this man whose money helped him get the job and give him the task of managing efficiency why because Mr Trump like so many others has in his mind that profit and efficiency are synonyms they are the same thing but the truth is they never were and to confuse them is to allow people whose only objective is profit to present to you as if their Pursuit was in the interest of efficiency for God's sake don't be fooled okay now my general point and I mentioned this to both you and Michael so maybe Michael can comment on this as I look at the programs that I hear about deporting immigrants erecting tariffs making the Europeans pay for the war in Ukraine or else close the war down uh or the mumbo jumbo of privatization I mean what you just showed us is remarkable it's as if this man was rip vanwinkle had been asleep for 30 years remembered the slogans of 30 and 40 years ago which were by the way privatization deregulation energy dominance articulated by a man who seems bored telling us about it which is the only glimmer that there's some intelligence there because bored is what you ought to be because that is the oldest recipe for something which not only didn't work but produced such a backlash that Mr Trump got elected none of which seems to have penetrated through the thick skull of this new secretary of Finance well I think he's a Secretary of the Treasury and I want to talk uh about uh his economic policy and the uh relationship the uh what Trump has proposed is quite r IAL uh Trump has said that he wants to merge the Federal Reserve into the treasury uh I think that's a wonderful idea uh the Federal Reserve was created a in 1913 to break control of the financial system away from the government to put it in the hands of commercial Banks uh JP Morgan and a group of other people said we don't want elected representatives to have any say in how the economy allocates credit so we're going to create a new institution the Federal Reserve and it's going to take over all of the treasury's policies we're going to move it out of Washington uh to New York uh Wall Street Chicago with the Amile exchange Boston Philadelphia and other Financial uh centers and were not even going to let a treasury representative sit on the Federal Reserve board uh the government will have no say at all over uh Financial policy tax policy or uh General who's going to get the credit and what will the credit be used for uh we at the Federal Reserve will run the monetary system to help the banks to help Wall Street not to help the overall economy which is not what our interest is our interest is making money financially not by helping uh raise U living standards well just imagine uh what this would mean to actually put the FED back into the treasury uh the big fight between them uh that I remember occurred uh in the early 1950s uh when uh the economy was just beginning to recover when Eisenhower uh was coming in uh the fight was over interest rates just like it is today uh the Federal Reserve wanted to raise interest rates because it says we have to stop inflation when the FED says inflation it means Rising wages it said we have to keep uh the economies recovering there's been this whole post-war recovery but one bad thing is happening wages are going up and that means that the loans that our banks have made don't have the command over labor as much anymore it's easier for labor to pay off its debts when prices and wages are rising so want to uh raise interest rates to keep uh keep low the uh uh wages low well the treasury came in and said there's a problem here uh if you raise interest rates then the money that we pay to bond holders is going to go way up and the federal budget is going to uh have to spend more and more money paying interest to bond holders then the the FED said but Bond holders are AR constituency the banks are our constituency we make more money at high interest rates uh the the treasury tried toh say no we don't want interest rates to go up but Eisenhower and the Republicans said uh the Federal Reserve has it uh the Federal Reserve has dominance over the treasury what that means is that the private sector has more control than the public sector all of this was called the Federal Reserve treasury Accord uh uh and that issue is exactly what's in today uh right now you have the the Federal Reserve lowering interest rates uh in order to somehow keep the stock market and bond market uh Rising so that when Trump come takes over in January uh the FED can then say Oh there's an inflation let's raise interest rates crash the stock market uh as a result of the fed's action and then say look at what Trump has done he's he's collapsed the stock market the economy is going down because the economy is the stock market the economy is what uh 10% of the population has 87% of the stocks so uh essentially they want to set Trump up for a blame he realizes that and I think that's what he wants the treasury to do so uh now we have uh the Mr uh Scott bessent put in he's a hedge fund manager imagine looking at the economy as if it were a hedge fund a hedge fund it's a zero sum game you bet against somebody else in the financial horse race and uh if you win and he became a billionaire doing this then somebody has to lose uh he made his uh first Fortune working with George Soros in raiding the BR British pound uh and Soros put together a gang of wealthy uh Financial financers that said we can all s sell the pound sterling and the British government won't have enough money to outbid us and we can force the pound down they rid Sterling they forced it uh to to devalue they made a billion dollars on this well just imagine how uh Mr Bessant can repeat that at today with the Euro it uh it's pretty sure that uh the euro is going to go down when uh Mr Trump's policy of cost cutting comes in by cutting uh if if Trump can cut uh the membership in NATO uh there goes uh the Euro down uh there's the question is how is this going to affect the domestic economy well as uh Nima said uh Mr bessent said uh he's going to uh do what uh the Japan's disastrous prime minister AB did in the 1990s uh and Obby did what Margaret Thatcher and Tony Blair did they're going to privatize they're going to shift the tax B burden on to uh consumers uh basically and they're they're going to begin selling off uh whatever assets the government can have it's very hard to cut back social spending because there are a lot of vested interests in there I guess the only thing you can really cut back is uh education because president Trump said he's going to abolish the education department let's privatize education uh just as Thatcher uh began her uh privatization by selling off British telephone and uh the water companies and the bus companies and uh her job was finished by Tony Blair moving to the right of uh the conservatives by uh selling off the railroads prices for everything uh transportation for buses railroads everything went way up prices of water way up phone costs uh went way up uh the uh privatization is going to drastically uh raise prices and uh what we're seeing really is uh the punch two in the one two policy that the Republicans have been using for the last 50 Years first they cut taxes uh on the rich not on people as a whole but basically on the wealthiest 10% then they say look at the budget deficit we've uh created we've got to fix it how do we fix it we cut spending and bring is if somehow uh you bring spending down to live within the tax cuts uh on finance and real estate and basically rent seeking uh activities uh you don't raise taxes again you you you begin selling off uh and cutting spending that's basically uh What uh what they want to do uh the question is what on Earth do they have uh uh to sell off uh what can they privatize here uh that's left well they're going to probably privatize the post office uh they'll merge it with maybe United Parcel or someone else imagine what that's going to do not only to your post office fees but uh you have to pay but are to a monopoly the prices that you're going to have to pay um privatization of schooling is going to be uh essentially there will be no more free public schooling U it'll all be either the students and their families will have to pay or the localities uh New York City and other cities will have to pay for the education so there's a a huge shift in the cost of government uh off uh the uh being financed either out of taxes or out of simple simple uh government money create creation the fact is that it it isn't necessary to uh Finance the uh budget deficit out of U uh cutting taxes as monetary uh modern monetary Theory points out the treasury could solve it very easily you print a trillion doll coin give it to the treasury now you have a balance sheet now you don't have to borrow anymore you finance the American economy today like the United States finan the Civil War you just print the money it's no more inflationary than borrowing the money from Bond holders and actually it's less inflationary because you don't have to pay uh interest uh I think you can expect uh Mr bessent to point out that uh uh the government Accounting Office says that if uh the uh bu deficit grows at the rate we expect and interest rates return to normal high rates like they are today or at least last month then uh the payments to bond holders are going to be larger than all of America's military spending that's also forecast is rising so uh we're we're in an economy that looks like it's going to be essentially draining the whole economy to pay to the bond holding and banking class that's the uh the problem that uh Mr bessent at the treasury faces and that's all also the solution right across the board for Trump's appointees he wants to abolish a federal agencies and essentially uh do to America what Thatcher and Tony Blair and uh prime minister AB did uh in Japan did and it's going to uh raise costs very substantially it's going to put the class war back in business it's going to mean that the wealthy people who used to pay uh the costs of financing government uh are replaced by the lowest uh the lowest income brackets uh it's it's a degree of polarization that they dare not say out loud but uh that's the policies and that's certainly uh the attitudes uh that they have you have a deficit cut we we've created the deficit by cutting taxes uh now let's the one two punch let's cut we can't cut spending that much but we can begin selling off the whole country we've already sold off politics through the citizen United U ruling at the Supreme Court what else do we have to sell off maybe that's what we should we have to be a standup commedian I guess to really begin discussing this yeah Richard yes let me pick up what Michael said but at it from a slightly different vantage point in my judgment what he said could be summarized as a set of consequences or effects from what I keep referring to as the declining Empire when this system can no longer pull wealth from the rest of the world the way it got used to doing in the second half of the 20th century it is now facing contractions and it didn't expect to lose the war in Vietnam it did it didn't expect to lose the war in Afghanistan it did it didn't expect to lose the war in Ukraine it is in the process of losing that one and perhaps ending it is what Mr Trump is going to do because it is such a losing proposition well the importance here is if the American economy is constricting then the people at the top the policy makers the CEOs the big political leaders all of them they basically face an existential choice voice they can say to the people our Empire is now in Decline as every Empire has always been it's not our fault it's the way Empires go and we are now going to all have to get together and work out how we as a society navigate a decline it can be done even the British who didn't do a good job were able to navigate in the end of the 19th and across the 20th century The Disappearance of their empire so that's one way to go and the other way to go is to say we are the rich and Powerful we can and we will hold on to all that we have gained in the last century we who benefited most from the American Empire Empire we will hold on and will offload the costs of a declining Empire on to everybody else who needs a college education who needs payment to working class people who have no job who needs who needs who needs we don't have to have that we can deregulate and privatize or any other Madison Avenue BS to cover it over but what it is is we're going to keep ours in fact we're going to grow ours you it's your own fault look at the the tone that is even B brought in by the people that Trump is gathering but here that's the bad news here comes the good news the decline of the American working class is now 30 to 40 years old real wages are completely St Stant for 30 to 40 years the Wall Street Journal and other magazines and newspapers like that have to say wait a minute no no no uh over the last 50 years we've done the math it's up 10% if you get a real wage increase of 10% in 50 years that works out to less than half a percent a year and that's a rounding error you can't even be sure your measurements are not the reason for such a CH that is that's called stagnation over the last 40 years the real average real wages in China have quadrupled there is no contest here we are sticking it to the working class but why is that good news it's good news because that's why Mr Trump was elected the first time and because he didn't stop that process Mr Biden was elected the next time and because Mr Biden didn't stop that process Mr Trump could get back in and you know what if Mr Trump keeps doing what he did before and what Biden did he will go out in four years as spectacularly as he just got in because neither he and to be fair neither he nor the Democrats are facing what the problem is telling the American people what it is and coming up with something that might unify the country in dealing with an existential decline of an Empire that is rough but they're not doing it they're pretending they can do whatever they want they can you know blow up the pipelines in the North Sea they can push uh push Europe into the status of of a vassel in a feudal Arrangement is horrific to watch the only thing ugly than what is being done to Europe is the complicity of the leaders of Europe in all of that happening because they're so desperate and and the rise of China and the bricks is the counterweight to all of this and there's nothing in Mr Trump's economic proposals and please Michael if you disagree point it out to me I I I would be happy to be corrected I see him doing tariffs that's going to worsen the inflation but the inflation is what got him into office he can't do that you Deport 10 million of the lowest paid people in the country put aside the moral horror of it you're going to take away the people who do the lowest paid jobs those jobs have to be done they are essential I'm not even going to that point about how much it would cost to do that although that's relevant I saw a statistic recently that one out of 15 families in the United States have a relative who's an undocumented immigrant so you're talking about touching millions of American families with a personal catastrophe the political implications of that they don't seem to have understood but I want to stay I'm an economist so you get you get rid of 10 million of the poorest paid people remember what an undocumented immigrant has to go through if you're an undocumented immigrant and you've done a good week's work on a construction site somewhere and so it's Friday afternoon you're about to go home you're very tired they work too hard and you go to pick up your pay envelope and the boss says sorry we're having financial difficulties we can't pay you this week what is the undocumented immigrant going to do he he or she can't go to the police because then they risk being deported they can't go and complain to some employment Bureau for the same reason the first rule of all undocumented immigrants is never go near any agency of the government it's too dangerous why am I telling you this because every employer knows that that he knows he can periodically make a worker work longer hours not pay them make them do dangerous work make them do work when they buy their own equipment their own uniform that it's endless and it's a significant part of the profits of those Industries if you really remove the Immigrant they can't do that it's not just that they have to pay someone a higher wage which they will but it's actually a much higher wage when you factor in what never shows up in the statistics which is all the horror that undocumented immigrants suffer okay lots of wages are pegged to the minimum wage there are lots of job categories where you are told by the employer we pay $1 over the minimum or $2 an hour or three okay if you you raise the minimum then every body's wages go up that's why we haven't raised it I mean here's the reality the the minimum federal minimum wage is $725 an hour it's been that since 2009 look what we have done for 15 years every year prices went up sometimes only one or two% sometimes 7 89% but in every one of the last 15 years a worker getting the minimum wage $720 could buy less than he could the year before every year what kind of society does this to the poorest workers among it among itself what kind of society treats the lowest paid people in that way that's a level of Cruelty and immorality that is beyond language a lot of Americans wonder how do the Israelis perform the horrors in Gaza that they are now performing but you don't have to go to Israel we are systematically savaging our working class and you can pretend otherwise but the numbers are right there they're in what Michael said and they're in what I'm saying and the the anger of the American people so obvious in the support for Mr trunk it's not anger at Kamala Harris no one knows who that is it's anger about their economic pinch that's hurting them and doesn't look like it's stopping and doesn't seem to change with Republicans Or democrats RS so the Republican who looks like he's a little different from the George Bush boredom is Mr Trump so they go for him and because kamla Harris is you know the vice president of Biden and Biden is the same old same old you got something new Trump and the same old same old as my grandmother used to tell us you can't beat something with nothing that's a problem here but that's a problem that Mr Trump shows no sign what he's going to do flamboyan things merge the FED into the treasury and the education department Deport to me it's wonderful it's how he ran his off remember how he ran he had two ideas very bold I'm going to have a wall of Steel against the invasion of the Immigrant I'm going to have a wall of tariffs against the invasion of the Chinese Goods that's it Mr War man but those were dramatic ideas he didn't have to say more people understood oh he's doing this and he he's doing something dramatic everything kamla Harris said was small wasn't dramatic I'm going to extend the child tax credit I'm going to give firsttime home buyers $25,000 towards their I'm not going to tax tips very nice very good but there's no drama there's nothing big there's nothing spectacular the reason people now say Bernie Sanders would have had a better chance is precisely because he by the very label socialism would have been there saying I'm GNA do and then come up with some new deal uh uh package that would have been big and bold and that might have had a real chance because big and bold otherwise was the Monopoly of Mr Trump but his big and bold is as economic policy utterly incoherent he can't afford an inflation he can't afford all this spending he can't afford and do that and cut back on taxes he can't do it and if he does do it the chaos will claim him as one of its major victims yeah Michael well I think that uh what Richard has described politically is that America's in for a uh as far as the I can see uh one one term presidents uh Trump uh gave way to Biden Biden was quite rightly uh uh replaced by the opposition by uh by Trump again Trump will not solve the problems that Richard's talked about and so he'll be replaced uh and the I I guess the idea of the duopoly we have is let the American voters to go uh vibrate Republican Democrat Republican Democrat as long as they're all saying the same thing as long as there's no uh real change and uh everybody's just get more getting more and more miserable all they can do is vote throw the bastards out uh but I want to comment I think what Richard said in his first sentence is really the key to analyzing what's going to happen to the US when he said what do you do when an Empire is collapsing and you can no longer support your riches by what you can uh obtain by imperialism an empire mean and imperialism go together what do you do uh well there are actually two uh uh possib ities there the first possibility is well the old imperialism didn't work let's see how we can still extract something from the rest of the world uh in other words um let's try to solve it internationally and then domestically Richard was talking about domestic attempts to solve it I want to talk about Trump's International attempts to replace the failed Empire with the new post Empire form of exploitation well the first thing he's going to do is realize why do Empires collapse the main reason is they don't really pay in the end and one reason they don't pay is because of their military spending it's really very hard Trump has already said he doesn't want to pay for fruitless Wars uh like the war in Ukraine against Russia uh he's quite happy to pay uh for uh genocide Wards in uh uh in Palestine but not not uh uh the Ukraine war so uh he essentially has criticized NATO said we're not going to pay for uh NATO's spending anymore we're going to cut it if uh the uh Europeans want to indulge in the fantasy uh that Russia is going to somehow create a 200 million man army that it would take to March back into Poland and Czechoslovakia and East Germany on their way to England uh then uh let them indulge their fantasy uh but they'll have to essentially we're not going to pay for that uh because we have no interest uh in the fantasy the NATO fantasy that uh Russia is somehow an imminent threat well immediately that's going to uh cause a repercussion in Europe uh Europe is run basically by NATO uh and the European Union uh leaders like uh vanderlan uh and most of the other NATO leaders there's uh already you're having the crisis in Germany where the proar parties uh Schultz and the uh the social Democrats the Christian democrats and the greens are being thrown out by uh the anti- uh imperialist parties the the Nationalist alternative for deand and the left-wing Sarah vag party I think you can see all throughout Europe you're going to have a revulsion against NATO and a revulsion against the United States now imagine that uh uh I can see what Trump is thinking he said well now uh if we're not going to pay for NATO uh one good thing for America that the fighting in Ukraine has done it's emptied out all of Europe's armaments how are they going to remake the armaments well they don't have gas and uh Power uh to make real metal work and much manufacturing they're going if they really want to indulge and uh by adopting the American imperialist fantasy that was uh they'll have to buy American uh Military Arms so uh essentially Europe will face the problem very much like what Richard has described uh here uh is it going to be uh for uh the right-wing the military uh to benefit Europe as it goes down to try to maintain the power that it's had or uh will there actually be a European attempt to create a democracy and overthrow uh the people there they will have uh a one one- term presidency uh overthrown and again well the second thing that's going to uh uh uh preserve America's ability to exploit foreigners uh is going to be Trump's proposal for tariffs uh he said uh he has a fantasy about what tariffs were in the 19th century before uh 1913 when the income tax was uh created in America how did America finance uh the treasury it was indeed through tariffs uh mainly protectionist tariffs uh and Trump believes that we can go back we don't have to tax anyone get rid of the income tax he's ose that let's impose tariffs well we uh what do we do we'll make if we have a 10% tariff on European Goods uh that's going to create money and he's proposed a 100% tariff on Chinese Goods which will double uh immediately the prices of all the consumer goods through Walmart and uh and also uh the in the uh industrial goods needed by American companies of vital components uh that they're getting from China from Apple to all sorts of computer makers to uh automobiles to airplanes uh Right Down the Line well China will simp simply say well we don't want to U I think we've discussed this on an earlier show with Nima um we don't want America to get rich and have the money to uh use the Tariff receipts uh from our trade to uh spend on uh surrounding us with military uh installations you know we're going to impose Our Own 100% tariff on goods sold out to the United States so uh you can just see where this is leading enormously uh rise in prices uh and A disruption of uh the American economy this is the kind of shortsightedness um and I think when when Neema and Richard talk about about the fact that everybody's going their own way there doesn't seem to be any uh synthesis uh going uh this is what happens when you have uh everybody with a tunnel vision looking for their own self-interest and uh there is no real concept of a national interest that's called the road to suron when you talk about uh taking looking at the economy as a whole road to surom that means government planning that's communism uh and that uh who says that people who want to uh deregulate the economy to prevent economic regulation to get rid of the antimonopoly legislation that we've had uh to essentially uh take away the government's power to even exist everything's going to the private sector that is really the uh the the attempt to use the ending of America's ability to get rich from foreign ERS to make a grab bag here and we're going to see a kind of grab bag of course the uh the uh wage earners are going to be the main sufferers because the vested interests are trying to say if as Richard said is the Empire is going how do we the vested interests make sure we don't lose uh we're going to try to make the rest of the world lose in other ways uh not military imperialism like in Ukraine not military force but Financial fiscal uh all sorts of other economic forms of exploitation uh I want to say something when when Richard's talking about the undocumented IM immigrants uh it occurred to me that people are talk right now there's all the talk about artificial intelligence and robots uh doing jobs and replacing labor there's one kind of Labor that I don't think that uh that Rob robots can replace and that's the kind of Labor that's done by the undocumented immigrants uh you can take them by categories a lot of the Filipino immigrants have specialized in uh nursing uh taking care of uh old people uh uh personal caring uh and cons and construction as Richard pointed out is another thing how are you going to get U to uh use uh to robotize uh construction it's a dangerous job uh it's it's almost impossible to do that uh the the uh work that immigrants uh especially the undocumented ones perform uh can't be replaced by automation uh there's uh no nobody who is going to replace them because the American ideal of working as a wage earner to get your way into the middle class defined as buying a home uh is not open uh to undocumented immigrants how are they going to borrow money how are they going to go to a bank and and uh get a mortgage but more important how can they even accumulate the down payment and earn the money to pay the mortgage to buy a home in uh today's uh today's environment unless there's a massive investment in public housing well instead of a massive invest investment in public housing what we're seeing by Trump's whole team that they have in common is the idea of let's privatize it all let's sell off what uh private housing we have uh let's uh let's their product is homelessness basically you could say that's the product of the of the policy well if that's followed uh you can imagine that what happened to H prime minister starmer in England uh the the British voters voted against the disastrous conservative party they went to the opposite extreme let's get star the labor party and starmer is the labor party always does in England moves to the right of the conservatives uh and is e even worse and now his uh approval ratings have fallen from I think something like 70% to 18% I mean just absolutely plunging we're seeing throughout the world I think from Europe England the United States uh throw the bastards out uh is there an alternative to the idea of well our way of cope our way the wage earners way of coping uh is limited to just uh changing the guard that's uh the vested interest uh lobbyists who uh are appointed or who we are uh are appointed for us to vote for uh in the elections throwing them out or are they going to do what Richard KN spent our life talking about saying there is an alternative I think that's uh what's going to be uh un what is unfolding in the next four years yeah let me comment a little bit about about that last Point particularly but first I I want to invite people to enjoy the irony Michael says everybody's going their own way there is no coordination I couldn't agree more you know the the China and the bricks are developing their notion of how to proceed the United States is doing its thing Europe is not know which way to go this is all supposed to be okay because if you remember how they've interpreted Adam Smith if everybody pursues their own self-interest well it'll all work out really well in the end as if God had led us by his invisible hand to just that happy outcome this bizarre rationalization of chaos has gripped the excitement of people like our new treasury secretary but its patent absurdity couldn't be more obvious than it is than it is today given everything we've had to say let me also underscore that you can't get rid of the undocumented IM immigrants in terms of the work they do we have in the United States over the last 40 years made it impossible for the old traditional family to survive you cannot survive on the husband the man's so-called family wage that was sufficient to take care of him and to take care of the wife and to take care of the children and possibly the elderly step by step starting in the 1930s Social Security had to help take care of the elderly and then after the war when basically the women were pushed out of the labor force and then forced back in because the stagnant wages of the male made it impossible to afford the so-called American Dream unless two things happen the wife the teenage children and the elderly would all go out to work the elderly would become greeters at Walmart the teenagers would do something on the weekend and the wife would get a service sector job or a manufacturing job but of course the family then falls apart because the enormous domestic labor that the women always the wives performed now has to be performed by who by an undocumented servant whom you can get away with treating and paying and working in a way you cannot get most native born people you do away with them you will take the family which is an institution on life support as it is in our country and push it over the edge and that too will come back and kick the best out as the rage about all of that gets focused by the Democrats on the Republicans just like the Republicans just did to the Democrats as we have tried uh as we have tried to say and now finally what's the alternative I think the alternative is what we are doing granted we're not clear yet we're groping it's it's tentative it's mixed but there is an enormous sense that the world could be operated under different principles that you didn't you could have used the 100 plus billion poured into Ukraine for a lot of other things that the American people care more about than Ukraine which a majority of people cannot locate on a map in this country okay those issues are coming to the four when Michael points out correctly that the level of debt service that the federal government now has to undertake is second only and to the defense budget and catching up quickly far larger for example than the combined outlays of Social Security and all health Services it is going to become very easy for radical Democrats to look at that defense and paying off the rich creditors of America are the priorities Social Security and health far behind we the Socialist represent the reversal there's a dramatic issue we are going to prioritize X and Y not a and d and that's going to be the Big Choice you give people a choice between guns and butter after years of too much guns and too little butter and you're going to see the same swing of the voting population that you saw this time in One Direction next time in the next but the next if the next one is another Democrat they may win but if they don't understand this then they will go out in four years and we'll have the one term seesaw that Michael is talking about the irony here is and I think both Bernie and uh a few others have already said in the last few days and it's not just the progressive wing of the Democrats taking advantage of their defeat I mean it is that but it's not just that it's also beginning to recognize that Bernie might have done a hell of a lot better than kamla Harris and that freezing him out may have been good for the Centrist Wing but it wasn't good for the party as a whole and that that perception is going to eat into the Democratic Party so it's important for Michael for me for you Nima to keep these conversations going because they are the fuel to find that new Direction so we don't keep digging a deeper hole for the whole country which is what we are doing uh what we are doing now there's a new just to give you an idea Peru made a deal with China the Costco company of China not the Costco that we know here the the discount retailer it's a Chinese company they are building they're just finishing now a port on the Pacific uh ocean in Peru which cuts the travel time between Shanghai China and the Western Hemisphere by two weeks I mean a very it's an enormous amount of time cut thereby cheapening the cost of shipment and becoming a way for the entire Rich Agriculture and mineral resources of the Southern half of Latin America to create they will now be exporting to China China needs it they need it it you know and this keeps going this has been going on since 2019 while all of these Shenanigans hear the real it on the ground is changing everything in precisely the direction we're talking just like the endless discussion of selling uh f-16s to zalinski that meanwhile on the ground the Russian army takes another 12 square miles takes another Village you know on the ground and that's becoming the dominant shaper as the rest of the stuff up above goes nowhere they're boxed in and a last Point much of what we do on this program with you Nima is an attempt to break through the enormous level of denial that we face look at the people being appointed by Mr Trump are they talking about declining American Empire not a word did kamla Harris or Donald Trump talk about the declining American Empire during their campaign and what we need to do about not a word did they address the catastrophic inequality that now grips this economy not a word what this called in Psychology is denial a way of coping with your problems by pretending that they're not there but that doesn't solve anything and the mixture of the experiences this country will have to go through and a critical discourse about it which is what we try to do those are the crucial two elements which will eventually give us what Michael is looking for Michael do you want add something yes Richard has said so many different things uh I I want to uh I'll have to pick and choose uh right after Bernie Sanders a few days ago said the reason the Democrats lost is they're not representing labor they're not coping with the problems that uh workingclass people actually are are suffering that's why they're not voted the head of the Democratic National Committee immediately said what an awful thing Sandra is to say doesn't really belong in the party at all you know let's repudiate him very strongly uh and said we are never going to let uh the Sanders and that wing of the party gain power here so uh if you if you have the way in which the Democratic party is organized as a corporation legally owned by uh and run and administered by the Democratic National Committee and they are dead Cent centered on doing doing what Richard said the vested interests do when an Empire is falling apart making sure that uh they get to keep their own rake off uh and living standards and make the rest of the economy suffer that seems to be uh the set Democratic uh party policy I don't know how uh within the duopoly system without having a representative uh congression uh parliamentary government like in Europe uh there's no way that we can have uh here a number of different parties uh like Germany and France and other countries have where there is an alternative to the vested interests that monopolize things uh the uh Americas run up against the Constitutional problem of how the electoral system is set up uh in a way to prevent democracy how are they going to do well what is it the way the Democratic Party copes uh with uh what the polarization we're having and the way the Republican uh party is coping with uh What uh Richard has called chaos they call the magic of the marketplace and it's the marketplace that theed interests shape and spent the last hundred years more than that shaping and controlling to make sure that they are in control of the marketplace they are in control of the relationship between debtors and creditors between wage earners and employers between states and localities on the one hand and the federal government on the other so we're dealing with a a fixed Marketplace that uh isn't anything natural at all not an expression of the natural order that the enlightenment Eon economists and talked about were it's a stacked Marketplace in which the casin Cino always wins and the marketplace is in a c in a casino that uh is the rules are stacked against wage earners who are uh not being able to increase the minimum wage not being able to do any of this and uh Richard quite right points out that while uh the irony that while Trump wins on a populist program any party uh who's going to throw out a polarized uh Di dictatorship is going to win on a populist program what does this mean in practice uh we're we're the way that the ruling class is coping is to change the meaning of language chaos becomes the natural workings of the marketplace well doesn't everybody voluntarily sign the contract don't the debtors sign their IOU to the credit card companies because they believe that borrowing money will benefit them well of course it benefits if the alternative is being homeless uh or going without food for dinner but uh that's not really what uh the economic structure is all about uh you have the economic curriculum in universities not talking about this you have the mainstream media not talking about the kinds of economic Pro problems that we've just been discussing for the past hour how are uh I think before you can have a political upheaval uh to of a socialist form you have to have uh alternative narrative alternative set of Statistics to steadily uh put uh the charts and pictures before uh the people to see what's happening you have to have a vocabulary and a narrative that is uh now almost completely absent uh from the discussion here it's the kind of narrative that the bricks countries are trying to put together as they're trying to spell out how do we avoid the problems in America other countries are looking at uh the American uh debacle and saying how let's look at the American Empire and what it's become how do we avoid becoming the sharing the Fate that the American economy uh has had that's uh basically what it's all about right now uh and [Music] the the question the political challenge to Trump is how is he going to avoid becoming an American starer the labor party uh person in England how is he going to avoid become to becoming like the Japanese prime minister AB well you can see inter what if I could interrupt just one moment I I saying about the narrative and I would like if I give me a minute yeah an example of a change in the narrative that could help us at this point let's take immigration we have seen that Mr Trump has made the Crusade against the Immigrant demonizing them they're an invasion they are rapists they bring disease and crime I mean the most extreme language and he's now nominated a person who talks even more extreme than he does about it okay and we watched the sad spectacle of kamla Harris doing a kind of me too but not so harsh okay here's an alternative narrative that a left that was conscious of the the situation in the way you described it Michael might have responded here we go across the 19th century and into much of the 20th the United States experienced extraordinary economic growth from being a small colony of the British Empire to becoming a global power it did so by means of attracting and integrating immigrants step two a healthy growing economy attracts and integrates immigrants who then go on to become productive members of the community that's what we did in the 19th and 20th Century what Mr Trump represents is an indirect admission that we are no longer a healthy growing economy but instead of doing something about it he's going to deport the immigrants which is a stupid self-destructive response they therefore will not go on to adapt and become productive Ive citizens the country's economy will be minus the product of what they could have produced and then we could string in 400 examples of stunning immigrants you know like I don't know Elon Musk and others you know easy but we make the deportation either a stupid act or an admission of something they don't want to admit or both it's a way of saying we're not we are about the growth of the American economy and therefore we will accept them and now imagine the last step the Declaration of a new Marshall Plan a kind of let's call it not a green New Deal an inclusive New Deal every person is guaranteed a job first priority all native citizens who want a job will get one second priority all immigrants who want a job will also get one that takes care of the competition between domestic and imported workers they will not be there one another's enemy and we will do something both of them will applaud and by taking those Millions off of unemployment the government will help pay for this program and by raising the taxes on all the expend these employed people will now be able to make you'll generate government revenue Etc here's a plan and a good one and a bold one and a lot better than what Mr Trump either offered or is able to do in the period coming ahead and I think comparable shifts in narrative will build the very movement that Michael's talking about I think what Richard shows is that the The Narrative uh should be historical not economics instead of just talking about economics in the abstract telling the historical uh the how history works out what Richard has just said this is the way that people will understand it better so uh you call us economists but what we're turn turning out to be really is uh is historians is the way to get our point across I agree I agree the history is always always the best guide to these sorts of things always yeah thank you so much I can I think we can wrap it up great pleasure as always Richard these are these really are important conversations and again Nima I want to thank you for organizing and making sure that they keep happening my pleasure I agree
