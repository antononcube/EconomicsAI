uh General broad world worldwide impactant hi everybody today's Thursday January 23rd 2025 and our friends Michael Hudson and Richard wolf are back with us welcome back thank you glad to be here yeah let's get started with what's going on right now with Trump and his policy toward the conflict in Ukraine uh here is what he said about sending more weapons to Ukraine and what he's going to do to deal with pun could be very soon and and you talked a bit about Ukraine and Russia but how long do you think it would take to end that conflict and I have to speak to President Putin we're gonna have to find out he's not he can't be thrilled he's not doing so well I mean he's grinding it out but most people thought that war would have been over in about one week and now you're into three years right so he can't be he can't be thrilled it's not making him look very good now eventually you know I mean it's a big machine so things will happen but uh I think it'd be very well off to end that war we have numbers that almost a million Russian soldiers have been killed about 700,000 Ukrainian soldiers are killed Russia's bigger they have more soldiers to lose but that's no way to run a country and here is what he put on his social media he says that he's going to put more taxes tariffs and sanctions on Russia and not only by the United States but also but by other countries they he's going to force them one of these countries would be Saudi Arabia here is what he says about Saudi Arabia going to ask Saudi Arabia and OPEC to bring down the cost of oil you got to bring it down which frankly I'm surprised they didn't do before the election that didn't show a lot of love by them not doing it I was a little surprised by that if the price came down the Russia Ukraine war would end immediately right now the price is high enough that that war will continue you got to bring down the oil price you got to end that war they yeah here is Richard he said that he Russian economy Russia is dealing with the their problems in their economy military and their political problems here is what the Russia's Financial Times shows the GDP of Russia 2023 and 2024 we know that the Biden Administration tried to put tremendous sanctions on the Russian economy and here are the countries who have sanctioned Russia and huge amount of sanctions on Russia and do you right now in your opinion what Donald Trump is trying to do Richard and what is different from Joe Biden and what he's going to bring to the table that is different from the previous administration well given what you just read me he's not bringing anything different he's going to do the same thing um he had given indications that he wouldn't uh maybe now he's forced by his advisors and by the people he surrounds himself with uh to talk in a different way very hard to know with Mr Trump what he's going to do or not he doesn't think about it very well or very clearly and certainly not consistent consistently I would like to talk about a couple of the things he said which I found really interesting and typical of the United States in a way we should be very concerned about he seems to think that a war a costly one to boot is somehow un necessary evil for a country I wish that were true but it isn't and the the strange thing is for an American to do that let me remind you of our history roughly a century ago our capitalist system had collapsed in 1929 for an entire decade actually more than a decade we had an economy with levels of unemployment in the double digits uh into the 20 5% level in 1933 we had a cut in our total output that is we didn't increase our economy we shrank it we had Devastation across the country and everything the Government tried didn't work it seemed to work a little bit in 1937 and then it collapsed later in that same year you know what finally lifted the United States out of its depression that brought it back it was the war during the war they took half the unemployed people and stuck them in a uniform and the other half they put to work making the uniforms and the guns and the bullets it brought the United States out of a war It produced a military industrial complex that has been a sustainer of American capitalism ever since even though it is Stupify costly much more costly than the Russian Wars ever were including this one but the United States seems to think that the war is a cost that can only have some sort of negative effect on an economy does it have negative effects of course people die resources are wasted but it also has all kinds of other effects which American history is the number one example of when Mr Roosevelt took the United States into World War II he rescued the economy and everybody with half a brain knows it so I'm astonished not really I'm just saying that I'm astonished when my colleagues write arti Les about how much the war must be costing where were those articles back in the 1940s the war was costing no the war was saving democracy and just coincidentally saving the capitalist system guess what it's doing comparable things for the for the Russia of Mr Putin and if you actually wanted to know it just look at the polls Mr Putin's popularity makes that of Western leaders look like the disaster it is Michael well your chart is uh wonderful because it shows uh that who the the loser uh was of all this Germany uh at the end so uh I even even broader for Russia the issue is not just the Ukraine war What's called the Ukraine war is the war of Russia to undo NATO and undo the whole NATO system that's what every statement of President Putin is Led off with you've had uh numerous uh guests on your show that are all explaining explaining this how for Putin uh he winning in Ukraine is just one front of this broad us war against Russia uh that is it's being fought in the baltics where uh the US is trying to get uh Sweden and the Baltic states and Norway uh to block Uh Russian ships from using the baltics that's been threatened uh it's being fought in uh the uh Georgia and uh Romania where the US is installed is trying to install pliant oligarchies uh overruling the election but most of all it's being fought uh in in Europe and the collateral damage of the War uh is been uh the European economies as uh Trump has already described what he wants them to do and uh the war has and the sanctions which are certainly part of the war on the economic front have been strengthening Russia which is why its GDP is growing but also its balance of trade is it's now making its own food F its own manufacturers its own products that it used to be importing from Europe here are you Richard here is what yeah go ahead Richard I just want to add to that there is something here and I'm not used to giving this sort of analysis but it keeps jumping out at me so I thought I'd mention it you know these the politicians of Western Europe together with those of the United States are becoming and I know it upsets them historical relics they strike me as fighting the old Cold War as if it had never ended they learned what their craft if they have any during the Cold War and it just conditioned them that the way you make your way on the conservative side of politics whether you're in a conservative party or a liberal party or a labor party you make your way on the conservative Side by being a cheerleader for capitalism and putting as much hatred on the Soviet Union or Russia but you got to put some hatred somewhere it's in your genes by now you don't know any other way so even if Mr Putin or or asks to be in NATO you can't know I mean we you're not to deprive us of the person we can fight against we can claim is the enemy of democracy look how seamlessly the leaders the conservative leaders of Europe who used to tell us that communism and socialism are the great enemies look how easily socialism and communism were replaced by Russia and China or Russia alone they need somebody to just oppose it's it's in their way they don't they don't know how to deal with a world that isn't divided into the good guys and the bad guys with a need to show how loyal you are to the good guys and how determined you are to fight the bad guys look at Ukraine itself its leader is a joke an ex comedian in in what was called before the war the most corrupt government in Europe to make a a a genius leader saving his people you know what that's called that's a reach that's hard because it is so difficult not to start laughing at the very project but no no no in the great struggle of Good and Evil we know Mr zalinski is on the right side so he is good his his denial of civil liberties in his country we do not discuss Mr Putin's we make a big deal it's childish behavior and in the long run millions of people will recognize it for what it is here is Michael do you want to add something Michael all of that's true it's uh obviously what's at stake is something much more than Russia and uh the important point about uh the US strategy is that it's so self-defeating and I think we're seeing that in almost every policy that Trump has announced it's a not only is it driving the wedge uh against the European uh countries that are making really the all the war sacrifice but Trump has o opened a economic war on all fronts and the war is aim uh mainly against his closest allies like Mexico Canada uh in the Western Hemisphere uh and that's because he can control his allies it's very hard to get uh non-allied countries or distant countries Global South countries or other the bricks countries to go along with his policy but he starts with the countries that are closest economically to the United States and by pursuing his policy of America First he's saying all other countries have to be the losers because that's what America First means uh America's sort of like a a black hole uh in Cosmic sense it's its gravity is pulling all of the other countries uh towards it and the countries closest to it are like Mercury around the Sun they're the ones that are being pulled into it uh and we're seeing the strains are threatening to break up America's ties with its closest neighbors Canada and Mexico right now and then spreading to uh the European allies Japan and the other uh countries that it's uh believes that has the most diplomatic leverage over yeah here is what Trump said about the EU and the future plan he has for them or are you going to send turn off the tap soon well we'll look at that we're talking to zalinski we're going to be talking with President Putin very soon and we'll see what how it all happens we're going to look at it very one thing I do feel the European Union should be paying a lot more than they're paying because under Biden I mean we're in there for $200 billion more now it affects them more than it affects us we have an in between right little thing called an ocean uh the European Union should equalize we're in there for $200 billion more than the European Union I mean what are we stupid I guess the answer is yes because they must they must think so but the European Union takes advantage of us tremendously on trade and they now take advantage of and and always have if I didn't get involved years ago my first term one of the first things I noticed was that they're not paying enough they're not paying and a lot of those countries weren't even paying the NATO countries they weren't paying only seven out of 28 were paying we were one of them and Poland was one and they had a few of them that were paying and some were paying very proudly usually the closer to the borderline of Russia they were the faster they paid okay the ones that were further away tended not to pay so fast and one thing on that I think they should lift their number not to 2% but to 5% NATO should be at 5% not at 2% 2% is ridiculous yeah US president here is what he said Richard and it's it's it's unbelievable because the policies of the Biden Administration literally destroyed the economy of Europe and right now he wants to increase the defense budget which goes to the pocket of NATO which we know whose NATO is the United States and military industrial complex he wants to increase that to 5% which all of schs that he's not resisting any sort of policy from the United States is just saying we is not possible for the size of the economy for the situation that the German economy is experiencing right now well I I find it interesting for these for this reason the postor War II deal as I understand it was that the United States would provide a military umbrella and that the European countries would not have to develop their military because they could rely on the United States to be their protector against the evil Russians the United States undertook to do that because it meant an immense flow of money to the military industrial complex that would otherwise have been cut off since World War II was over and you didn't need to spend that kind of money on a war that you weren't fighting so you had a new kind of war the Cold War and the role of Europe as the great Front Line the way Michael just said or no As Trump just said the countries closest to Russia were at risk blah blah blah and and so we would do that and what this allowed the Europeans to do was to reposition their conservatives into Power how because the money that the conservatives didn't have to spend on Military they could spend on making themselves rich but also funding a welfare state which they had to do because otherwise their own people would have made a revolution particularly let's remember after World War II Communists were in the cabinet and the government in France and Italy and that that that whole resistance against the Nazis was led by socialists and communist etc etc so you had to make a deal here that this was very dangerous so that was the deal they'd buy off their own people with a welfare state by the way one more generous than anything the United States was willing to do and that has been true ever since to this day so for Mr Trump to tell them I'm going to hit you with a tariff and I'm G to press you to spend 5% rather than 2% which is sort of what they were doing is is where's that going to come from either the people who run the society will have to take the wealth away from the rich which they can't do because that's their only real support or they'll have to cut the welfare program and with the size in of the left in their countries and the size now of the right they're in they can't do that that that's their political undoing so he's putting them in an impossible position by the way the same applies to Mexico if he in fact deports millions of people which he says he's going to do and he puts it tariff on Mexican Goods coming into the US which he says he's going to do let's very briefly be clear that means millions of people without work coming into Mexico looking for jobs the tariffs by cutting off a part of their export Market the US is the largest market for Mexican exports means that they're going to be firing people not hiring ing people because unemployment goes with losing your export finally the return of millions of Mexicans not only means people coming for work that isn't there joining their own unemployed compatriots but the end of the workers here means the end of the flow of remittances which has been an important part of Mexican economics that means you are plunging Mexico into an economic catastrophe all good that's what you want on a country you have a Thousand Mile border with from who you haven't been able to stop the flow of immigrants before you are creating a situation where millions of Mexicans are going to try harder to get into the United States if you do this stuff than they did before before and your crappy wall won't stop them any more than it did before so the these are policies that are designed well let's put it this way I don't think they're designed for anything these are theater pieces you see I'm a president who's going to do better for America by sticking it to the people who aren't those folks in Panama are over charging us I'm going to take you know what this is an impotent giant thrashing around because he can't stop the decline and he got into office as promising to do something for the people already suffering it's great theater it got him into that office but it isn't going to solve any problem and the poor idiot is sitting up there going to Pres died over his own undoing which is what he did the first time and he'll do it again well Richard uses the term theater piece and uh I was thinking earlier today that there's a wonderful metaphor for what's happening uh it's a movie piece and probably Richard's the only one of us who's old enough to remember the Bing Crosby Bob Hope Road movies of the 1940s uh and 50s and uh bing and Bob were two song and dance conmen uh who would go to foreign countries trying to take advantage of the natives and they'd always find themselves in some scrape and uh bing would get out of it by selling Bob as a slave to some Arab is the road to Monaco uh in 1942 was uh was there uh he promised Bob that he'd buy him back uh and Bob went along with all these plans in every movie uh Bob Hope was the Fall Guy and Bing would end up uh as the conman's leader who would always sort of make a plan uh and pull them out and because this was Hollywood uh there was a Hollywood ending and they'd all Escape together uh with what they'd uh stolen or taken from the victims well it's like we've seen a series of diplomatic Road meetings uh uh with regard to the United States and Germany uh or Germany uh Germany's playing the Bob Hope uh victim character uh the US has sold out Germany uh its industry by destroying nordstream and uh uh Chancellor Olive Schultz went along with this uh agreed to it all uh spending in other countries uh have gone along and uh it looks you you now have the head of the European Union uh Von Delan saying yes of course we should pay 5% uh of our GDP for for uh for military uh because she knows that most of this is going to be paid to the United States for exports of Military Arms because German industry uh is pretty much dismantled uh even though the war is your other guests have shown uh the US arms have not done very well and the American German and other tanks have been blown up uh very quickly uh Trump uh basically he told today uh the Davos economic Forum that's the clip I wish you'd shown uh he said I want to quote my message to every business in the world is very simple come make your product in America and we will give you anything uh we will uh we will give you among the lowest taxes of Any Nation on Earth unquote uh otherwise if they try to continue to produce at home and uh other countries their goods uh and don't shift their production to the United States their products are going to be charged tariffs that Trump has talked about uh 20% so it's as if Trump is saying to Germany s your Enterprises of quadrupled come to America and get them for almost as low a price as you were paying Russia before you elected uh uh leaders uh uh to let us cut off northstream it but I'm I'm glad that uh Richard mentioned Mexico that indeed is the problem and let's look at the balance of payments effects of this are most important uh the the imports from Mexico from the United States are basically from a whole ribbon along the border between them and uh president uh the US Mexico policy really was pushed uh uh forward by uh the neoliberal uh president Carter who said we we've got to keep American wage levels down uh what do we do let's uh promote trade with with Mexico and under Carter the American companies begin to set up [Music] U small Affiliates all along the line mad Doras where workers would come they were assembly plants and workers would take all of the manufactured parts and assemble them into goods and sell them uh to the United States uh and this was a major source not only of Mexican uh dollar Revenue but to um corporate profits because corporate profits said uh thanks to uh you know President Carter uh we can now applo uh lowcost Mexican labor instead of having to pay Americans uh where there's a minimum wage well then came Bill Clinton with NAFTA and NAFTA formalized uh the free trade area North American free trade area with Mexico and Canada and uh you had this madora uh low wage labor making goods for American parent companies uh take place and the counterpart to this in Canada was the auto PCT uh the autoa was back in the 1970s there was a an argument over who's going to benefit from making American Automobiles and the American uh companies uh car companies established Affiliates in mainly in Windsor a Canadian city right across the river from Detroit and so they basically there was an argument I won't say an agreement uh it's it's called an agreement but really there was a dictated Arrangement where the Canadian companies would make the auto parts uh that would go into the cars and the parent uh auto companies uh in Detroit and elsewhere would assemble would put these assembled Parts into uh the the finished uh automobiles so all of this was uh part of the auto company's attempt to by low priced Canadian labor and the price of Canadian labor to the American companies kept falling and falling and falling not because can Canadian wage levels were going down but because the Canadian dollar was going down uh as a result of uh Canadian Financial policy and US Financial policy so the US found that when uh you could get countries with depreciating currencies uh that was a way of uh getting uh more and more lowcost Imports and these imports from Canadian Auto pars and Mexico's Maduras were not competing with American uh uh exports they were making American exports to other countries more competitive because they were low not made by high priced American uh minimum wages but by even lower uh wages to Mexicans and Canadians that is what uh Trump is threatening to uh interfere with so uh with seemingly without recognition he has two choices either he's going to say well of course we'll make an exception for uh the melador and for Canadian autos because they're not really Imports they're part of the US economy uh northern Mexico and Southern Canada are really part of the US economy um and so we won't tax them well this kind of favoritism would be so blatant to other countries that it would destroy the whole us Narrative of uh promoting free trade democracy and uh the free market so I I don't think uh Trump knows the uh Inc es of exactly how much America is gaining I was in Ottawa when the uh trade the autoa was going through and you I can assure you that the uh Canadian politicians were very resentful but they felt there's nothing they can do well what can they do now if all of a sudden uh there will be mass unemployment in Canadians I can't imagine that the auto companies uh would have so little leverage over the Trump Administration that they'd say we've got to producing stop producing cars because our Imports uh of the assembled parts that go into the cars now have to pay such a high tariff 20% that there's no way we can export our cars in competition with those of Europe or China especially Europe because the European currencies are going down as they have to spend more and more money on on arms uh for NATO that's going to force their currencies down their trade balance will go down the currency exchange rates are going down and uh so these uh Financial instabilities are going to uh backfire on the United States which rarely takes into account how other countries are going to respond to US economic aggression yeah they can't because in order to sustain the theater of Mr Trump he has to be able to bloviate about taking the Panama Canal and subordinating these he can't ask let alone answer the question what are these countries going to do in response if we do all these things it's as if he controls everything and it's just been a matter of Having the courage to do what his predecessors didn't do which by the way is how he talks he imagines they you know that they didn't have America First of course they did he's not there's nothing new about saying America First not nothing new about saying it nothing new about trying to do it the problem is as we are going through here the things he says he's going to do have open-ended contradictory consequences right across the board let me give you another one from the clip you just played when he says to the assembled Davos dignitaries come to America you can come to a place where we'll have the lowest CL taxes in the world all right now let me translate that he's inviting them and he's making them a promise and that promise is either to provide them with these lowest taxes in the world by stopping spending on the social programs that Americans need and that's probably what he means or or he's going to go even further into deficit which he has promised not to do in his budgets otherwise he can't deliver the to lowest taxes in the world come on if the American people paid attention they'd realize he's telling the rest of the world come here because we're going to give you in in fact not just the lowest taxes but we're going to compete on wage levels with the rest of the world because unless he does they're not going to come just as they haven't come before they didn't come here because it doesn't pay the wages here remain much too high and the market is not growing anywhere near fast enough if they hadn't been that way we would have seen the arrival of large numbers of manufacturing jobs we haven't seen anything of the sort let me be very blunt everyone of the last dozen presidents has made the remark often in their inauguration how it's terrible how MA manufacturing has declined and as their commit to Bringing manufacturing back and Manufacturing never came back because they didn't believe in it of course they did because they didn't try of course they did but the economic truths of the system mean that capitalists around the world would be nuts to come here this is a declining Empire this is a country divided politically with a level of hostility and animosity that ought to make you wonder you spend a lot of money investing here you've got a leader who will take that away from you whenever it's convenient look what he's doing to his close allies to the countries that have done a lot for the United States which is Canada Mexico I'll omit Greenland because that's not a serious proposition or or Panama So you you're not going to make big that's why every president's invitation to manufacturers has gone unheeded the percentage of our economy that's manufacturing is ridiculously low has been at that and stayed at that across all the presidential bloviating to the contrary yeah well I'm glad Richard uh mentions Empire because it's uh uh Empire is much broader than just a set of bilateral relationships uh between America North America Europe and other countries there's uh the every Empire is really financial and the key to America's uh Imperial domination since since 1945 has been Financial the dollar and um what uh Trump is threatening with his trade uh uh tariffs and sanctions is the entire system of international finance that is denominated in dollars uh and I can explain this uh uh partly because of America's already uh trade trade policy uh but also because of the Federal Reserve raising of interest rates as we've discussed before in this show the dollar is going way up against other currencies uh not only uh Mexico uh the Canadian dollar has gone way down as a result uh Global South countries and other countries all of these countries are falling behind uh in their Debt Service and Mexico and Canada especially Mexico uh is going to be the canary in the Gold Mine uh about what is breaking up the whole dollar system that underpins the American Empire uh you may not remember that in 19 82 uh it was Mexico's default on its short-term bonds its tesso Bonos uh that led triggered the whole Latin American debt bomb of the 1980s once Mexico said we we cannot afford to pay debt unless we impose such drastic austerity that there's going to be unemployment and uh our party will be voted out of power uh because any party that follows uh the that puts the interests of creditor Nations first in being paid over its own industrial uh politics uh and Welfare of its own population is going to be uh uh voted out of office unless of course you're in Romania Georgia or Germany where uh Angelina burbach said it doesn't matter what voters say you know we're we're here and we're going to fight Russia but for most countries they can't afford that luxury uh of saying uh we are in uh independent of Elections and if they vote against us we'll just nullify the election uh American style or National Endowment of democracy style uh so there what is going to be the result if Trump would really do what he's threatening to do against Mexico Mexico would have to say uh since we can't pay the uh the foreign debts were suspending payment on the foreign debts this is pretty much what happened in 1931 when uh the AL allies in Germany all of Europe said uh we can't afford uh the to pay the debts that America insisted on uh charging us for the arms he sold us before World War I that forced us to impose reparations on Germany and uh uh we're broke we're going to have a moratorium we're going to stop all of this same very much like the other Brady Bonds in the 1970s other countries will say that uh Trump's trade policies have made it impossible to pay the dollar debts that are owed by uh countries that no longer can uh earn the money to pay the debts by exporting to the United States and what is being violated is the moral principle that is under underl uh the whole uh not only the US uh uh economic Empire but underlaid uh Britain's economic Empire in the 19th century the deal was that uh if other countries were going to let you dominate them financially and denominate uh their the what they the money that they borrowed either in British Sterling in the 19th century or dollars in the 20th century that uh the the uh Britain and America had to promise to let them import enough of uh their goods to earn the Sterling or the dollars to pay the debts uh and America violated that immediately uh in 1921 22 uh as soon as Germany suffered the hyperinflation and its currency exchange rate began to go down as a result of having to pay reparations to the Allies to pay their debts to the United States uh the Congress passed uh a tariff against countries with depreciating currencies namely Germany so they blocked Germany from earning the dollars to pay uh the hard currency to pay the Allies to pay their debts to the United States so there was a bit by the 1928 27 and 28 there was a big argument over uh the whole system of uh American uh Financial demands on Europe uh and John Maynard KES said that the the only logic uh defending a creditor Nation or a creditor economy such as the United States was enabling countries to pay their debts by exporting to it uh and he said this again when uh at Britain Woods in 1944 when the international monetary fund was being uh described he said that has to be uh you have to prevent a country who's a creditor from taking actions to block other countries uh from uh exporting to the United States and so he developed the bankor that if a country like the United States would be a chronic creditor country and Country like Britain would be a chronic debtor the at a certain point that would be Define the the Creditor claims would be wiped out along with the debtor claims uh that was kann's principal representing uh Britain of course uh and in way back in 1809 and 1810 David Ricardo who developed the entire Theory almost word for word oppos that's uh imposed by the international monetary fund today austerity uh Ricardo said of course other countries have to pay the Creditor Nation um and this will happen automatically you don't have to do anything let the free market work because because the Creditor Nation uh the the debtor country is going to pay money that means it's going to lose its money supply by paying it to uh uh to Britain that means its prices will fall and as prices and wages fall their exports will be more competitive and the money that's paid to Britain uh its prices and wages are going to go up its exports are going to be more comp uh more expensive and less competitive and and this is going to continue until the point where the uh debt paying country automatically is able to build up its exports to uh to to supply uh to Britain well that's junk economics of course but it's the junk economics that underlies the international monetary fund and it underlies the American fiction of somehow an international economy working automatically inbalance uh even if there's military spending uh and uh that was exactly what Ricardo was talking about during the Napoleonic Wars that were going on uh even military spending would automatically um lead to adjustment mechanisms well what Trump is doing is breaking up all the interconnections that have made these adjustment mechanisms work and uh the only response from other countries can be we've got to survive and uh we uh we have to put our own Sur vial against paying the dollar debts that are owed uh not only to the United States Banks and bond holders but to our own oligarchies like in Argentina that owns probably most of the Argentine dollar debt is Ed to its own oligarchy that's why they loved Miley's strengthening of the dollar it's making them Rich while it makes the rest of Argentina poor so your EXA you've created not only an international uh breakdown of trade and finance you've also uh spread a class War uh throughout the various countries uh outside of the United States and that's a wonderful way to say the economics that you teach in the school that is informing Mr Trump's advisors may be giving him the idea based on a little model that they worked out when they were 12 years old that if a happens then B then C and then D and all the rest of the universe is going to be quiet and not interfere in this nice AB b c d Story I mean that's how I was taught in the university and I knew as a student that this was nuts that this was fantasy that these relation and and you know the history of Economics is people who come along and say that TR that truism here's six examples where it didn't work and blows it up and gets a good by the way a good job doing that and then unfortunately sinks back into doing more of those little models as if he didn't learn from his own success it's silly you can't do the game Mr Trump is playing but you know maybe there's a deeper wisdom maybe Mr Trump knows somewhere and I I understand this is a reach but he knows somewhere what kind of a hustler he is and that his job is to stay in office and all this theater is is to stay in office I'm the unusual one I do the naughty thing I started my career by calling Mexicans rapists and I will continue my career by snatching the Panama Canal away from that country I'm going to pit the United States with its nuclear Arsenal against all 11 members of the Panamanian military you know the the absurdities of what he's doing the outlandish Behavior you know it's going to lead Americans at some point to say you know if you have a problem with the rate structure of ships passing through the canal what you do is call for a meeting send your foreign minister have a conference raise a question solicit propo what do you you jumped over all of the rest to threaten people this will not be forgotten if he proceeds he's going to be in trouble if he drops it it will not be forgot what is this about this is a man who's presiding over a sinking ship but to avoid the other people noticing he keeps saying look at how we came over this wave look at how we're overcoming this wave yeah sir but the ship is sinking oh no look at look at how well we got over that this as you said earlier Nema about another historical period I think this doesn't end well it never has it is hard for an economy and an Empire to decline I understand that but the best way to do it is to face it and to sit down with the others on this planet to work out a way to make that a livable experience for all of us not a shouting match heaving threats of Deport deportation uh tariffs punishments withdrawal my God what a statement of weakness this all is well that all seems to end well Richard uh I I like the fact that you've got personal and called uh uh Trump a hustler that's exactly what uh uh how he's made his fortune uh he will uh make he's making a threat to attack other countries he will do big tariffs unless you uh do what I want uh he usually makes a big demand and he's really just he knows that they're not going to go along with this what he does think is that okay settle for 50% of what I'm asking that's how as a real estate developer he treated his suppliers he wouldn't pay them he'd pay the normal policy of his was to offer them 50 say well I paid half well I didn't like your work so much here's half he no matter whether it was dealing with suppliers or subcontractors or uh uh Consultants uh he'd always end up uh paying them half after promising them the full thing I think that's a strategy with Europe he's trying to uh frighten Europe and Canada and other countries uh and trying to see how much they're going to uh protest and how much they'll actually say okay okay well uh we will give you this much and other this much is what Trump has wanted uh all all along and uh the the surrendering to Trump therefore is a you pointed out Richard uh would have to come at a the cost of a class war in Europe because if Europe uh follows its uh directives not to run budget deficits and it's spending more uh it's more than doubling its military spending it has to cut back social spending uh and uh the strongest response of Europe uh isn't to uh to give in uh it's simply to call his bluff they can say yes impose your tariffs uh and uh this is going to hurt uh us customers first of all because your prices are going to go way up and there goes your uh uh the inflation that you promised to cure uh on the other hand the neoliberals the billionaires that uh Trump brought to his uh coronation uh want a class war that's their ideology they want a a European Maga um you know make America uh make Europe a low wage country again make them into uh Mexico make them into a what we had dreamed that China would become uh that that basically is what he's trying to settle for and they don't have to settle just like Mexico doesn't have to say well okay you've you've vastic reduced our ability to earn or uh dollars but we're still going to pay the debts anyway because paying debts is a sacred assumption and that comes that's the prime directive even before developing our own economy and raising our own standards of living that's exactly the choice that he's forcing uh the other countries into uh and uh you know You' pointed out that that seems to be a bad choice if they uh succumb but if they decide this is an impossible uh choice for us to make then it'll be a good outcome because they they will find okay Trump has pushed the American Empire to such a critical mass of greed that uh we we've got to all join together with the bricks and can create an alternative economy yeah and I think that the rest of the world is more and more bringing to an end in a in a wonderful hegelian way the effort since the second world war of the United States to isolate and extinguish communism socialism Russia China and the ends up it's isolating itself it's making it you know if the future is green and Mr Trump is successful in getting rid of all the subsidies here then the all the rest of the world will produce Green Machines and green Alternatives and then when Americans want them they'll have to buy them outside the country and that will shape our economy because of our dependence on Imports it's like the story with the electric vehicles America's future is now in the hands of the Chinese because they're developing and constantly improving what is already the best electric vehicle I mean this is this is going to be repeated over and over and it should shouldn't surprise the United States because that's how the United States did it out of its infancy my God there's a level of historical Amnesia lurking around these conversations that's really scary because it suggests yet again the horror of looking at your actual circumstance and the choice of fantasy and self- delusion as the alternative and electing the most ambitious self- deluder of them all you see Mr Biden and and kamla Harris you know unable quite to equal they are the products of when it wasn't necessary to do that which is why the average people who suffered under them hate them and won't vote for them anymore well Trump's uh delusion that you're referring to is uh has underlain American uh diplomacy since 1945 and that delusion is that America is uh the exceptional Nation because we're entirely self-sufficient in raw materials in energy in agriculture we can feed itself uh and they assume manufacturing as well the illusion is precisely that America is self-sufficient so if it smashes up the international economic order like Trump is threatening to do uh it can survive uh because it can it can pull itself together and other countries will be uh so disrupted that American companies can go in and buy up foreign countries at a Pennies on the dollar certainly at a big discount and uh it'll the economy will be turned into a a grab bag well uh the the fact is that underlying all of this is Trump's imagining that he can make America an industrial power again that's is uh is his big mistake he doesn't realize that we're not in American industrial capitalism anymore we're in American Finance capitalism and finance capitalism is not very friendly towards uh uh industry it makes its money by carving up industry breaking it up selling it off in parts and moving uh it labor force abroad Outsourcing uh its labor and uh the I don't think there's a realization not only in Trump but in any of the American diplomats just how America has uh undercut it its economy and it has it's focused on what Mark's called the sphere of circulation uh money interest rent uh charging uh but not on profits wages and the uh actual uh expenses of making an industrial agricultural economy as a whole it's hollowed itself out that's what is not realized by the United States and other countries also are naive enough to think that somehow uh they don't have the upper hand in resisting American policy because America is will fall apart faster than they do if they stick together with each other and are mutually supportive and with a compliment agricultural industrial raw materials of production yeah there is a deep sadness in me really I mean it you know I was born in this country I've lived here and worked here all my life and I I appreciate what Michael is trying to get across to us there is a deep sadness in this in the kind of hysterical self delusion that's going on here I keep reading appr propo of what we talked before uh because I I had to do with Yale University a part of my life I get literature and they have a program for corporate Executives the leader of which writes these pieces that are wild F Russia's falling apart we don't have to worry by the end of this year they'll stop the war in Ukraine because they're falling a you know you know what this looks like and sounds like it's a person who's kind of lost their their connection with the world and are living in a dream world and you kind of understand them because perhaps they're ill or perhaps you know something traumatic has happened to them and so they make it all up as they go every weapon that Mr zalinsky could think of he asked for and in the end every weapon he asked for short of nuclear was given to him we weren't going to give him the Abram's tank we did we weren't going to give him the f-16s we did we weren't going to give him the missiles we did we weren't going to give him the a permission to shoot the missiles deep into Russia we did and every time he made that plea he said what you've given me so far hasn't worked which we all knew because we could see where the Russian army was compared to where it was last month last year so we all know it hasn't worked but we are we we are listening to be look at that clip he's going to go to have a meeting soon with Mr Putin and he's going to threaten him with what sanctions that's a total failure that's why we saw the table you put before the sanctions have allowed Russia to grow faster than it used to and faster than the United States it is an illusion to throw more TR sanctions what are you doing it is and you know at a certain point you stop being irritated and angry and you become kind of sad for people that are now so deeply underwater that all they can do is gurgle the nonsense that didn't work because they don't have anything else they have nothing to sit down and talk to Mr Putin about Mr Putin is a very popular leader in his country his army is winning the war he has not going to change because that's been a successful policy the effort to get China to act more like the United States has been going on since Nixon and and Kissinger went there that hasn't worked the Chinese to the surprise of no one having a system that has grown faster than any country on Earth for 30 years isn't about to change that because that would be lunacy so either you face this or you start disconnecting from the world and live in a fantasy my wife is a psychotherapist I talk to her a lot this is a country in what those folks call denial it's when a human being has such difficulty facing a personal problem or a health problem and so it magically goes away by pretending it's not there that that and you know what that has never solved the problem ever well the question is whether this is really an illusion or whether it's part of a narrative that uh they know is not realistic but they're hoping and uh convincing the rest of the world that it works my wife is also a psychotherapist uh and she sees how manipulators try to create uh an illusion in uh their victims that uh uh of something that isn't really real but they're trying to frame how to look at a given problem uh in a distorted way and I think uh the function of the American Media the New York Times the other the television NBC uh and the others is to try to promote an illusion that somehow Russia is losing that America is winning therefore uh you should support uh the existing uh neocon neoliberal uh group in power for as long as they can all that they know that it's going to break in time I think they they realize that this can't go on that it'll break but they're trying to hold on to the last year the last minute as long as they can keep grabbing what they can uh before they say time to Take the Money and Run yeah I I think we can wrap it up right now thank you so much Richard and Michael for being with us today great pleasure as always okay thank thank you as well yeah thank you byebye
