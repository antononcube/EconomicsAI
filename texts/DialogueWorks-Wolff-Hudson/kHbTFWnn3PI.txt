hi everybody is Thursday February 20th 2025 and our friends Richard wolf and Michael Hudson are back with us welcome back glad to be here let's get started Michael with your recent article about the price of gold and how the United States is trying to manage that what's your point in that article well the point is that the uh demand for gold has been running way ahead of supply for the last 15 years and yet the prices remained remarkably quiet uh there was a a range of gold from 14 to, 1600 uh dollars an ounce uh maybe 10 years ago and then uh there was another range from ,800 to $2,000 an ounce until just a year or two ago and all of a sudden fin finally the prices began uh to rise and there notes in the newspapers about England bullion dealers uh sending enormous plane loads of gold to the United States so needless to say what how do you explain what's happening just a half hour before this show began I got a phone call from one of the big uh uh cable networks wanting me to go on their show and to explain why gold today hit a new price uh and I'm talking to you not them so uh here's what the situation is uh the United States uh wants to keep the dollar is the main International reserve and the one thing that frightened American uh policy makers was that other countries would begin to dollarize by increasing the proportion of gold in their foreign exchange reserves uh China way up Russia way up uh about six years ago Germany said you you know that gold that we moved to you in the 1950s to keep in uh the Federal Reserve safety uh could you send that physical gold back to us uh you know we're noticing that you're grabbing the gold supplies of Venezuelan and countries you don't like we' just like to have the gold here and the United States said well you know we really uh can't send it right now how about in six years which is right about now they still haven't sent uh the gold and the question is is there any gold left in Fort Knox and why not how can it be that the price of gold has been held down by the US Treasury uh manipulating the price and it turns out uh that we can all now see that the price of gold is not like the price of copper or wheight it's not based on supply and demand it's all based on the treasury manipul culating the price of gold and it does it in two ways one is a very technical way that I won't go in it sells gold short in other words it sells uh well the price may be 2,900 now but we'll sell it to you in three months time for $2,800 an ounce well that uh for that means that nobody's going to buy more gold now if you know you can buy it at $2,800 an ounce in three months so they keep holding the price down and uh the other way for the last 15 or 20 years uh the United States uh treasury the bank of England and other central banks have made money leasing their gold to gold bullion dealers in other words uh it's like Avis uh leasing a car to uh somebody to drive and uh the US uh will lease to a bullion dealers for a given price yes uh we'll lease you the scope here's the current price of gold you pay us a premium for renting this gold and then the uh the bullan dealers will meet the supply of gold from uh hoarders whether they're jewelry makers whether they're investors whether they're hedge funds and this has worked pretty much ever since the United States went off gold in 1971 uh but what's happened is that this making money by leasing the gold to other countries all of a sudden means that uh there's no gold here the United States has a claim on bullan dealers to say well send us back the gold uh that we've leased to you now uh it's like Ava saying you've rented our car you know for two weeks now give us back the car but the the bullan dealers have sold most of the gold and so they'll say well we'll give you the money for the gold uh but uh we don't have the gold so it looks like all of a sudden the United States I won't say a paper tiger what you call it a gold lame tiger uh there it seems that the United States doesn't have uh the gold in its possession uh that it's reported and so a few days ago uh Mr musk said uh we've been trying to find out to do an audit to see how much gold is there in the Federal Reserve in New York uh City that acts to hold foreign gold Holdings and Fort KN well uh you have some of the cons monetary conservatives in Congress like senator Paul saying I want to go to Fort KNX and look let me see whether there's anything in the vaults they wouldn't let him in and he said look I I'm a senator I'm a congress you know you have to let Congress we get have to get in the answer was this is National Security Congress can't know about how much gold we have or have not got there so now you have Mr musk saying we're going to do an audit of uh the the fed and uh we're going to do an audit of uh the Federal Reserve Fort Knox you've got to let us in and the United States panicked and it's been uh the speculation is now the gold price is going up because the United States can no longer have the gold to keep it down and in fact the United States is trying to buy it all back to put back in Fort Knox so that people will think gee uh it's not the US does have the gold after all so all of a sudden you're seeing the links to which the American government went to say there is no alternative to the US dollar don't buy gold it's not going up you can make much more money investing in treasury uh Securities where we pay interest gold doesn't pay an interest all of of a sudden the uh the motivation for buying gold that has existed ever since 1971 uh has sort of broken out and everyone says okay now as demand for gold is going up that means the price of gold is is going to go up when demand exceeds Supply that's what's happened and uh as gold goes up other countries not only Russia and China but all Europe all over the world are going to say say uh we can make much more money holding gold in our reserves than holding us treasury bills uh or Securities in our reserves so let's sell our US Treasury uh claims and buy gold well what if that happens you can imagine the dollarization of the world and there goes the whole lynchpin of American Financial control of uh the the world economy there goes the central role of the US dollar all of a sudden it's given up not only to Gold but it's been uh it's been giving it up to foreign currencies uh countries trading in each other's currency like China and Russia trading in their own domestic currencies for their imports and exports so you're having a whole unraveling of the fiction that somehow uh there is uh no alternative to the uh treasury Securities that foreign government so in their uh foreign exchange reserves uh that is a better buy than uh us treasuries all of a sudden yes there is a better buy uh it's gold and so the gold bugs are all jumping on this and uh we're all waiting to see whether Mr musk and his investigatory team gets to go into Fort Knox in the fed and say is there really gold there what happened to it and you mean that there hasn't been a free market in Gold All These Years uh you mean the can you explain to us uh what's behind us policy and essentially it'll be the dynamic of uh uh the America having the exorbitant privilege of being able to pay for all of its military spending abroad it's cold war it's deindustrialization simply by printing IUS uh that end up in foreign central banks uh and finally they have an alternative just to say going to buy more and more IUS when if you do the basic accounting the United States owes foreign governments so much money while it's running a balance of payments deficit mainly because of the war that there's no way it can ever pay the other countries the money that it owes them uh in dollars for the dollars they hold in their reserves so the whole Lynch pen of the America's free financial ride which I described in my book super imperialism is is coming undone uh every along with everything else we're saying a coming undone in American foreign policy these days Raa John yeah I think you can see this um and I guess Michael and I play this this duet fairly often let me try to put it in a in a in a bigger historic context what he's saying the decline of an Empire takes many forms it took a lot of complicated Maneuvers to build the Empire up the system that Michael just summarized the ability of the United States dollar to play a certain role in the world and then to be able to continue to do that even when it goes from a a surplus budget to a balanced budget to a deficit budget and now to deficits that we calculate in the trillions of dollars per year okay it doesn't take a genius to understand that what might work at one level won't work you what you can do if you don't have um a national debt higher than your GDP becomes a more questionable issue when your national debt is greater than your GDP we W we've gone from one to the other and what what is it's not a technical issue basically what Michael is teaching us is what are the mechanisms that begin not to work at one level even though they worked at another level why is it now that people are asking these questions well it's because the price of gold is going nutty and when you ask you know what is it because literally the price of gold is if you take a look at the last 10 years you will see price movements that have no no possible explanation in the normal language that we use for that now you you know smart people will start saying well what's going on here right the investor only cares if if I can sell it for more than I bought it but the rest of us are trying to what is going on here now you begin to see that oh look um the Chinese who once were number one creditor of the United States are now number two uh why because Japan which was used to be number two has become number one and the the political relationship between Japan and the United States is about opposite to what it I mean Japan subordinates itself to the United States for all kinds of reasons China does not and that's a big fat hint as to what's going on here and then when you point out that Russia is also then go even further that our great Ally England is also these are statements of people making a very old decision the deeper in debt is the debtor you are giving credit to the more you better rethink what you are doing because that person if they get to the point that Michael mentioned being unable to repay because they can't play the old game you're going to be St stuck and you don't want to be stuck and even if you're only stuck temporarily that temporary being stuck could be the moment when you need that and you can't get it it's like people don't understand the FDIC guarantees your bank deposit but they don't guarantee how quickly you're going to get it if your bank folds and you make a claim okay they'll process the claim two years later you'll get the money yeah but in those two years you needed the money for the operation for your wife who didn't get it and who died you know I mean I'm I'm making it up but I just want people to see there's a rational way in which a declining Empire let me go even further let me drive this home Europeans over the last 10 days have been delivered a message they didn't want to hear that the difficulties of the American Empire require not just tariffs and protection because they can't compete the way they once did but also they are going to eat their allies they're going to starve them and break them and take back from them whatever they think they gave them and you know it's a very old story if it's very cold in your house and you have no more wood you start taking the clapboards off the side of your house and feeding them into the furnace does that get you warm yes it does but the next time there's a storm the snow is going to come right into your living room and you can't do what you are do it it's not Costless to take the cadboard it may seem that way cuz you don't have to pay for it it's already on your house but you can't do it and you can't do to the Europeans what you are doing without them now taking steps not not in hostility but to save themselves that interfere with your plan to use their resources to save yourself this is a we are at a very key moment I know Michael and I have been saying that for a while but does seem to me that whether you look at gold prices or you look at vice president Vance's remarkable behavior in Europe last week that you are seeing the acceleration of signs of decline well Richard that's what allies are flooring we'll call them protectorates yeah I want to make it clear that what that what we're talking about is the foreign debt of the United States the problem's not domestic debt a months ago on neeman's show we explained how there's no domestic problem about running a deficit uh because as long as the United States owes debts in dollars it can always print them uh for Americans the problem is that if it owes debts in dollars to foreign countries it can't print their currency and they don't want any more dollars there's a dollar glut now and it's that dollar glut I think that's LED uh to uh president Trump to say we've got to cut back our military spending the military spending is not only increasing the domestic budget deficit that's uh now uh causing enormous interest payments to the bond holders uh but it's also U creating a real problem internationally people uh are now doubting the fact that the dollar can pay doubting they're calculating that they know that the dollar can't pay so he's trying to say well what do we do we'll make the Allies pay let's send them a bill for the uh uh for the Cold War we're going to stop uh spending money on Russia uh war with Russia because uh that's been uh the single largest factor in the US balance of payments deficit pumping all these dollars into the uh World economy that end up in foreign central banks that want want to use them now to buy gold so that's the connection between military spending and the reason that gold is going up and uh Trump I think that that uh is to avoid this uh reality breaking through that the dollar now has uh run out of its ability to dominate the world economy in the way that it's done since World War I by having most of the world's gold Supply in 1950 uh the United States had 80% of the world's monetary goal well you can imagine how far that's gone uh down now uh it it was uh the major export power for for agriculture oil and Industry because Europe had been uh destroyed during during the war none of that exists anymore the whole world that was put together after World War II uh is Fallen apart and Trump is recognizing that and uh is uh is is trying to disengage from the Cold War and the problem is that by disengaging he's not only shown uh the fiction of uh uh that's underlining the price of gold in the US dollar but the fiction that the uh the Europe needs uh Cold War protection that Europe needs military protection in case uh Russia is going to invade and you've seen in the last few days uh a radical for the first time a change change in the whole narrative about what the cold war is all about and what the war in Ukraine uh of NATO against Russia and NATO against China is all about you're having a whole change in the narrative and it's met on absolute denial uh I watched last night on NBC and CBS uh and uh uh Trump saying uh you know it was NATO and Ukraine that attacked Russia Russia responded to that that's uh uh Ukraine had a chance for peace uh and it didn't want it that's why we don't want it at the table it's had three years to negotiate peace it was on the table all signed and then uh Boris Johnson came from England and said no no fight uh and Trump is saying here's what really happened and uh Europe uh you know we're not going to pay for the fiction that Europe is going that Russia is going to be willing to lose 10 million people 10 million soldiers militarily invading invading Europe it it's not going to it has no need for Europe there's nothing Europe has uh to offer uh Russia it's all a fiction and the fiction is made up by the Military Arms makers that are trying to say you have to buy our arms you have to make us enormously profitable in order to stop Uh Russian elephants from uh invading uh this whole fictitious narrative is all coming apart now uh and partly it's the financial narrative it's the military narrative it's the whole narrative that the uh that countries are going to invade the only country that's doing in that is doing the invaded the only group is NATO's uh expanding and Trump says we we just can't afford to uh waste money uh subsidizing the uh military-industrial complex and in fact his uh Team musk and the others are looking into the enormous overpaying by the Pentagon for military spending uh the enormous uh overpaying for Cold War spending through Aid and the National Endowment for democracy and uh all of the cia's black budget all of this is being calculated and present it I think that when the State of the Union message comes up by Donald Trump in March he's going to give all of the preliminary results of the finding and he's going to say you know this is what we found almost the reason we're running a deficit is this enormous waste on projects that we don't need that don't help America that only help the special interests of the arms manufacturers uh the neoliberals the neocons that have taken over the whole Democratic Party party uh and the newspapers and the magazines and the media that the grand worlitzer of us the CIA policy has been manipulating foreign opinion to imagine that uh Russia had an unprovoked uh attack on Ukraine instead of being provoked for all of the reasons that President Putin of Russia and secretary lavro have been spilling out and talk after talk I think all of this was discussed at Saudi Arabia at the meeting last week and it's very clear when you have Marco Rubio and uh the Secretary of State and the other people there who in the past have not been actually been cold warriors uh not been soft on Russia uh they're acknowledging the reality of what's been happening historically is very much like Nixon going to China only the Republican could have done this uh not because it's obvious that they're not Putin's uh uh puppets they're not puppets of China uh only they could have uh been able to do this and uh without being said oh you're just foreign agents the whole fictitious Narrative of the Biden Administration uh and the uh the the Democratic the Obama Administration before that that started this uh whole Cold War pivot towards fighting Russia uh is all coming untangled now and we're going to see the unraveling being Spilled Out in the coming months I let let me add again this is the unraveling of an Empire it is the effort of a particular group of people uh to manage that process and to achieve it by providing support for the people at the top the 10% of Americans who own the 80% of the shares who sit on the boards of director all of that and the enormous apparatus that they created over the last 80 years of American hegemony this is a recognition by a portion of them still a minority in my as best I can tell but a minority that captured power which is already telling you a lot and they are they are going to try to hold on for the top that's who they are while the larger picture is adjusted because they can't do it anymore and they're willing to say it I want to remind people because Michael just reminded me that let's go back to 1971 when the unthinkable thing W mothers was to take the United States off the gold standard that had been established in Breton Woods at the end of World War II as part of the new uh International order and Nixon said we're no longer buying o gold at the agreed price we're going off the standard and gold then you know what do it now it's it's thousands of dollars not 42 or whatever it was back then okay so that was a republican conservative who was in a position to say the unthinkable that a Democrat could not have you know could not have done with done it and so I think we're seeing again uh somebody who for his own political advancement reasons latches on to something much bigger than himself that he can ride for a while but now and maybe here's a disagreement between Michael and me I don't know the neocons thought they had the way to run the system for a while it looked like they could do it for a while they kind of did it and then they couldn't anymore and now they've Fallen no one should think that the people people now in charge are not equally full of contradictions that they may not be able to control they may not be for example it may not be to make put it in the largest turn it may not work out to hold on to the wealth and privileges of the top 10 or 15% of the United States as the rest of the Empire Goes Down And as those people at the Top push the costs of decline onto the mass of people so I'm I'm reminded of that when I watch the wholesale firing of large clumps of federal workers what what what is that we're not stupid so the notion that all of this is about efficiency I mean that's too stupid I'm not going to deal with that that's like saying it's all because of the oak tree over there in the corner I understand that the oak tree is very powerful but I I'm not going to take that seriously so what are they doing well Michael gives us part of the answer they have got to do something about the level of deficits that are now out of control so they're going to they're going to cut the government workers they're going to tell us it's about efficiency but we all know that you know efficiency is like Beauty that's in the eye of the beholder you're going to Savage all kinds of programs not just diversity equality inclusion Dei programs obviously that but lots of other things are going to go we already see a dozen examples in the Press of firing people and then rehiring them the the next morning when you realize this is not a group of workers about whom the efficiency story can be told you know you'll do a lot of that you'll get a lot of media because the right the the liberal media don't understand the situation so they give the right story for Trump to overthrow them I mean you you're watching stupidity squared here it but that again is a sign of a decline but the working class may not accept this the working class May understand that if you actually fire hundreds of thousands of employees from the federal government you are number one teaching a section of your working class that accepted lower wages than they might otherwise have demanded because they got Security in their job yes it's hard working for the post office but once you have the job you have it for the rest of Europe they're being told no you don't there is no security in federal employment that's a shock to the American system and you know who the bulk of of government employees have been for 50 years those excluded from the mainstream of this culture women black and brown people that's who you see in the post office I mean exaggerating but you get the point you're taking people who whose loyalty to capitalism was already questionable and you're hurting them and you're shocking them and you're taking away the security that was what they bargained for in accepting the rest of this culture we're going to watch that play out and I guarantee you that's going to shake this Society but I'm not done those people laid off in the public sector where the hell are they going to go they have to go to the private sector and there they will be an excess supply of labor and they will drive down wages working conditions all the rest of it as they offer themselves Desperados with no government job to save them they have to go and and join the other GRE twers at the Amazon's workplace or or shopping or the Walmart or wherever they can get the lousy jobs that will be available to them also without security we already have a Reviving labor movement in this country this is going to be a big recruitment boost for them hopefully they know it and will understand it and will take advantage of it but I'm not so clear that Mr Trump has understood this well enough to have a billionaire be at the head of who's firing everyone that's not smart that's stupid because what that does is it galvanizes the gap between them and me I'm a postal worker I just lost my job and that that evening on television I see the world's richest man gloating over what he's doing uh uh oh that's not smart that's not smart at all and that that kind of mistake can come back and bite you in the rear end the Europeans last point there is something pathetic in what we're watching all of those European leaders who can't can't agree on hardly anything gathering in some expensive Palace in downtown Paris being spoken to by Mr macron whose whose days as the leader of France are numbered and the number is small you know this is there's something pathetic here we're going to spend billions on defense sure you are of course you are and where's that money going to come from how are you going to do that Germany is your Powerhouse they're looking at another year of recession they're not power housing anything they need the the oil and gas most from Russia and they're looking like they're not even going to take it even if it were provided or offered to them they're so lost and these are people of whom the best thing I can think of to say is coming out of World War II they did what I understand made sense then but over the decades they should have come to understand the leaders that they bet everything on the wrong horse well Richard I think what you're describing is uh while on the one hand we all approve the movements by the Republican to end the Cold War uh and to stop the military conflict uh the aim of all of this is to position themselves for the domestic class War uh that you're describing and I cannot disagree with you on that uh that is precisely what's been happening and when you see the uh that uh I was going to say president musk uh when you see musk uh supporting the alternative for deuts and the uh right-wing parties in Europe uh the the other parties that are doing what we like to see ending the Cold War ending the military confrontation ending The Killing uh all of this is uh motivated by the fact that uh we we don't want to run a budget deficit anymore and we're not only going to stop with the uh cancelling the military budget running running back uh military industrial weapon spending we're going to just uh walk right down the line and cut back the uh the deficit for public uh service spending uh public spending social spending in the way that you've just described now what is so striking about this historically is that it's the right-wing parties that have prepared themselves for all of this uh and it's all the way from uh a German uh to Italy and to Holland to Austria to other countries and saying well we're not going to stop by ending the class war the Cold War the Cold War is Over the class war is back in business we positioned ourself uh for beginning to uh balance the budget uh we're going to have to spend a lot more of our money buying American uh oil and gas that's going to create our balance of payments deficit we've got to uh counter the infl that we've having by pretending that the inflation is caused by employing too much labor we need more unemployment Europe is doing exactly what you've described as the United States wants to do the solution to any problem is to cut Wages that's the universal right-wing solution and that's what you're going to be seeing the economists uh come out with all the way from Europe to the United States that's the common denominator and it's that Harmony of class interests uh between the uh the financial classes uh the the upper 1% uh that is just as unequal in Europe especially country uh socialist countries like Sweden uh as it is in the United States and part of the uh the the Striking feature of this is there's no left-wing defense about it what you and I are saying today is uh what you would think that the labor union movement the leftwing movement uh his uh uh would be acting on and preparing themselves for and to put on a plane just as important as the settlement of uh NATO uh with Europe but that's not the case because the left has for so long put its uh Faith behind the ultra right-wing party the Democratic Party in the United States it's put its faith in the Democrats which are the war party uh The neocon Party The neoliberal Party The Obama uh party uh the party that in 2016 would rather lose the election to Trump with Hillary than win the election with Bernie standards Sanders who uh was a quasi socialist um the party that in uh refused to have primaries in 2024 and would rather lose against Trump than letting an open set of primaries occur where some PR Labor uh candidate might uh just wipe the uh wipe the street with the uh Harris uh so you're you're seeing the need to create create a whole a whole separate political party and that requires a political movement and a political ideology and a political program uh and the only uh uh the only presidential candidate that had a program uh for that was uh Jill Stein uh that we've had on neema's show a number of times spelling that out uh and the the one thing that the Democrats and the Republican are in agreement on is we we see the danger of a workingclass party and a workingclass self-interest occurring we've got to prevent any third party from getting access to the ballot for presidential election and for state and local election we've got to make sure that the American voters are limited to voting on uh between the Republican and the Democratic party both of whom back the uh the uh the 1% and the only difference between us is uh is the 1% going to make most of its money on military industrial stocks or on uh on other uh non-military uh non-war spending exactly the same thing is happening in Europe This is the common fight with Europe where uh the labor party uh in England under starmer uh just signed a a 100-year Reich uh agreement to support uh uh Ukraine he's coming to uh meet president Trump next week in Washington I think that's going to be very interesting uh to hear uh you're having the Germany saying we are going to uh ban the uh uh the afd uh alternative for deutan party from running on the fact that it's uh fascist what fascist opposing the war in the war with Russia uh what fascist uh opposing uh genocide in uh in uh Gaza uh they they've banned criticism of genocide and fascism uh from the near East to uh Ukraine they're trying to uh ban uh political parties uh who are not cold war parties there uh and uh certainly parties who would represent uh social spending uh and uh labor interests and because the labor interests have been co-opted by groups calling themselves Pro labor like the labor party in England or the Social Democratic party the SPD in Germany uh you're uh you're seeing this is this is going to be what determines the next 10 or 20 years and the United States is uh in and Europe uh has let the media be concentrated in in the hands of right-wing interests uh in the United States it's the the neocon right-wing interests the New York Times The Washington Post The Wall Street Journal uh saying the the major media papers in England Germany uh other countries are also controlled by the rightwing so uh uh the the fight the prize in this fight is the narrative who are people going to believe are they going to believe that uh the way to stabilize the economy is uh well you've got to Great unemployment you've got to prevent we've got to save your uh in you workers from inflation by firing as many workers uh as we can if we can only hold your wages down enough the price of eggs won't go up so much this is uh the neoliberal this is the economics profession uh in the mainstream this is the philosophy of how central banks operate and it's the philosophy of both the what passes for the leftwing and the right-wing governments in Europe so uh I guess what we're trying to do all by ourselves here is to create an alternative narrative hoping that somehow this will uh solidify uh and create a concrete political movement and concrete political program to oppose this uh from from the uh almost absence of any program that has access to the public media to the press to the television cable uh to the media outside of the internet here let me let me add to that if I can two considerations one um for all of this to work there has to be a redistribution of wealth and power in other words for this program that Michael has outlined for you to end the Cold War to reconnect the US and Russia to subordinate the European all of this um they're going to try to redistribute wealth in a variety of forms one that we've talked about by offloading the costs of e of Empire decline onto their middle and lower classes by concentrating their wealth so that they can create quote a European Defense uh architecture trying to hold power in this universe of Russia's our endangerment we are the leaders you should all vote for because look we are are saving you from Russia you know the alliance with the United States was rationalized and celebrated in that way now that the United States won't play the role they're going to do it with defense and that means cutting back on social program in order for this to work there has to be an acceptance by the mass of people of a decline in their standard of living I don't see any way out of it certainly relative decline but possibly an absolute decline okay so how are you going to get that the only way to get that given what we see in the world today is If political coalitions of the sort we see in Trump or for that matter in the Christian Democratic Union or the social Democrats in Germany or maon all of that is the following the ruling class a small group of people the 1 to 5 to 10% who sit at the top have always understood that in a in a universe of universal suffrage their hold on power is insecure they don't have to use old language a mass base and so they have crafted a way to do that I'm going to use the American example but with suitable adjustments it applies in Europe as well so here in the United States the Republican Party presents itself traditionally as the best way to do that over recent decades the Democratic party has tried to become a competitor to do the same thing so the Republicans build their Coalition as follow they go to White supremacists and say if you support the Republican party and in particular tax cuts for the rich free doing whatever it is we want we will give you a a lease on life which the rest of American society won't give you number two we will go to those of you that are very upset about abortion we will give you more than Republicans have given you in the past if you give us the support we need to take the economic steps that are necessary they go to the gun enthusiasts they go to the Christian fundamentalists they go we can make a list we all know the communities that have cut a deal in the words of Billy Graham's son Mr Trump is not a good Christian but he is very good for Christianity okay there it is don't need a don't need a compass to know what that's all about this is a deal the Democrats couldn't or wouldn't do what was necessary to hold on to their Mass base nonwhites trade unions women minorities all of that intellectuals because the Democratic party leadership wasn't able to deliver to them socially so decided instead to go after the money of the rich to become competitors with the Republicans for the big donations and they got them on condition that they downplayed the unions and the minority ities and and they did that so they lost those people and they ended up voting for Trump okay so now the question becomes and here is what I would like to say it is conversations like this bringing up the aspects that mainstream media either ignore or downplay that's our best chance and here's the politician in me to weaken to break to atrophy that Alliance if we can make clear that the cost of what is proposed by Trump and musk and what is accommodated as I'm sure we'll see by the Democrats is the undercutting of the social position of people who are Christian people who are white suprem and we can't and we don't want to argue them out of their prejudices that's who they are that's that's something else we will be the enemies of that no matter what we do they'll figured that out we know it but we can appeal to them on the grounds of what is happening to them as caught up up in the very things we discuss on this program and that is the way to weaken to break down that coalition to make it much harder for the trumps and the muses to get the support of all of those particular Mass bases they count on that's crucial I think and we should understand that that's as important a function of what we dis of our discussions is anything else yes we want to equip the left to understand better to strategize better to to figure out weak points to attack yes we but we also can do very important work on the Coalition without which none of this is going to happen none of it and by the way if we don't the Democratic party will they will have to do it in order to once again become the party in power with their Mass bases out voting the mass bases that the Republicans get and in that struggle we will always see jimie Diamond explaining to the world that he doesn't care which of these parties wins because he wins in either case and I can see it now I can see him being in no way Disturbed to watch Mr musk using efficiency to rationalize cutting social program that is as old as Methuselah all businessmen want to believe that you can cut taxes and all it does is remove the freeloading fat from the federal budget that's how they talk they were brought up on that way of thinking and in that way there's nothing new about Mr Trump at all Richard there's one word that uh we haven't uh said and I haven't heard it uh anywhere in any uh public media and that is peace dividend just think after every earlier uh end of a war there was always a talk of a peace dividend at the end of the war you don't hear about that now and why not well you just described how the peace dividend is not going to go to the people that uh have expected it on the end of earlier Wars uh th I think this phrase peace dividend can be our stake that we drive through the heart of Dracula and the Democratic party and the uh Republican right uh what are they going to do uh for a peace dividend who is it going to go to uh is the peace dividend going to take the uh form of large scale unemployment of laying off of Government Regulatory Agencies they've just began to lay off IRS officials so nobody can check the tax returns of the wealthiest people and already uh the tax returns uh investigations are mainly on the middle class not the uh uh not uh the 1% so that's really what we're uh let's look at what kind of cuts are and for every kind of cut that musk's team comes up with and saying is this a peace dividend or a class war dividend that's the uh phrase that's the narrative I think that we want to put uh in place and uh the it is a a peace dividend not to uh spend as much money on the military budget Ron and the uh all the other uh uh mergence of debt uh but is it going to be basically okay we're cutting down the deficit so we don't have to spend so much uh interest uh charges on rolling over the federal debt and can uh lower the interest charges along with the military spending but they're going ho ho when uh musk says we're going to cut it across the board what he means we're going to cut the peace dividend uh is as well as the end of the Cold War that's exactly what we want to point out that uh ending the Cold War should be uh an ability to increase uh wages consumer spending to increase the uh living standards of wage earners and what's called the middle class which are wage earners that don't want to think of themselves as wage earners but sort of as uh Real Estate Investors in miniature capitalist and miniature uh uh we we want we want a change of the narrative I think that uh you talk that maybe uh the uh voters can change the Democratic party I don't think that's possible I think the Democratic National Committee has structured the Democratic party as a separate corporate entity controlled by the uh the existing board of directors of the uh party that is more Soviet than the Soviet Union used to be and uh you you've just had the last head of the Democratic National Committee saying that uh any any supporters of Bernie Sanders we want to keep out of uh the National Committee and out of voting so the National Committee can uh when it comes to the nominating convention for presidents can outvote all of the voters talk about the 0.1% having more votes than the 99.9% that's how the Democratic party is structured with the uh Central Committee so I don't think it can be done through the Democrats it has to be done through a new political movement that is not suckered into thinking that somehow the only alternative to uh supporting uh labor and wage earners is the Democratic party uh the Trump has already won more of the labor support and I'm uh I think if with the his skill at narrative he's probably going to retain the support uh and I don't see any of the Democrats in Congress in all of the Partyline votes that have uh been coming up is being willing to uh take a stand in uh the kind of things that uh you used to be called associated Bernie Sanders uh and the uh the squad i i i they've been utterly silent in all this uh they're tickled to death to see finally the Democratic party and Republicans have a consensus today that they can achieve the dream of President Obama uh who was going to be uh change everything finally they can roll back Social Security and uh uh Medicare that was Obama's dream the the bipartisan chance uh bipartisan agreement the 2008 crisis when he bailed out the banks prevented him from doing that uh but that remains the dream of both the Democrats and the Republicans together as a duopoly so we're fighting two parties we're not just fighting uh one party there uh you've described uh how uh the Republicans uh mobilized their own base uh which is rather unique uh but the Democratic Bas is equally unique and uh that's really the problem here and it's the same problem that you have in Germany France and the other countries you have Macon holding on to power and the whole power elite there uh you're having that all throughout Europe uh while all of that's happening uh just today at the uh group of uh 20 uh meetings you have uh pictures of president Putin meeting with uh President Chief or the the the Russian and Chinese delegates I'm sorry uh meet meeting together uh providing the alternative so I think uh we may juxtapose the N position in the NATO countes to the much more pleasant uh discussions that are occurring in the uh Global majority yeah one is in the elevator going up and one is in the elevator going down and they pass each other but the movement is unmistakable here's two things to to end with that I think illustrate your point Michael um I noticed in the Press yesterday somebody in the musk operation is nervous and the way he articulated the nervousness was the reaction they do a lot of polling the reaction of of workers all over the country to the mass firing of public employees nobody is missing it so the suggestion of this worker is that what they better do is have an immediate dividend his word an immediate div he didn't call it a peace dividend he called it getting the people to support the effort at efficiency so that they can send every voter a check for $82.99 which is your benefit from the achieved efficiency of firing 280,000 or whatever it'll be workers but you see they are worried they are worried about what they are doing and how it might spin out of their control and turn against them and here's the second example tremendous effort coming from the spokespeople of military producers how what we are doing is a very important get ready pivot to Asia P you know what that is that's an attempt to say okay you can cut the budget but we have to make as big a danger out of China as we used to out of R when Russia is no longer useful as the arch enemy to protect against we have to say it against China the United States which shares the Pacific Ocean might pull that off for the Europeans that's too big a stretch they can't do that they have to hold on to Russia and in that difficulty for them we also will have extraordinary opportunities I agree then let's wrap it up thank you so much Richard and Michael for being with us today great pleasure as always listen and learning from you I learn each time and and I'm I'm grateful too take care by-bye
