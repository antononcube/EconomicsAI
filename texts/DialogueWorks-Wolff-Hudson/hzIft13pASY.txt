let's start with your latest article on Empire Decline and costly delusions you talk about this conflict in Ukraine and the complexity of this issue that we witnessing with Russia the West NATO and could you elaborate on this article because I found it so important for our audience well first of all thank you for your kind words about it um I wrote it because of my concern that the level of miscalculations involved in this war have to be explained I mean there are many aspects of this war and I know you have explored them with various guests and and you will continue to do so and that that's an important service but I want to uh pose and answer a question question and the question is there were terrible miscalculations made and I want to uh explore them let me Begin by explaining what I mean um early in the war and even before the War uh Russia had indicated that it considered this a threat to its security and um safety the possibility that Ukraine would join the economic Union the European Union and also NATO uh and then when they made the decision uh to invade which they did in February of uh of 2022 we know that there was um there were statements there were meetings and there were negotiations early in the war to bring it to an end before it could do terrible damage either to Ukraine or to Russia or to both of them uh but those failed and we know that there was a a role played by British prime minister Boris Johnson who went to Kiev and persuaded zalinski or at least that's the best sense I can make of it not to sign an agreement not to work something out uh with the Russians um okay then the war begins in Earnest and I know from the United States and from others countries too that the following miscalculations were made and articulated number one that Russia was weak and could be defeated militarily even by a much smaller country Ukraine if it got support from Western Europe and America number two that one of the objectives was to bring I quote bring Russia to its knees and or quote break Russia up into smaller uh National units like Ukraine for example and so on uh then the calculation was made that the Russian Ruble would collapse then the calculation was made that the Russian economy would collapse it could not sustain for any length of time uh a war I could go on but these were all shown to be huge miscalculations why because Russia showed that it can wage a war of attrition that it can do so better than the Ukraine and it can do it better than the Ukraine with Western Arms and Western financial support for anyone who isn't blind the Russians have won somewhere between a fifth and a quarter of the Ukraine territory which they now control and if anything they look stronger than they did a year ago and Ukraine looks weaker than it did a year ago the Russian Ruble has not collapsed the Russian economy is doing better in 2023 than it did in 2022 and is continuing to perform better uh in 2024 after 3 months than it did a year ago so the the military calculations the economic calculations were mistakes now finally the political calculations despite an enormous media effort to portray the Russians as war criminals to demonize Mr Putin as another incarnation of Stalin and Hitler and all the rest of it uh votes in the United Nations have been showing that the political support around the world for Russia is as strong or stronger than it is for Ukraine uh so I see here a Monumental miscalculation economically militarily and politically and I find that that the thing to explain more than what happens on the military Battlefield or what even happens in the United Nations or even what happens in the global economy what in the world made the collective West the United States and Western Europe and Japan agree to a level of calculations which undergirded their decision to fight a war and this is of crucial importance to understand how and why this happened and if you're wondering why is it important because it has already led to the literal destruction of the UK of of Ukraine I mean the economy there will not recover for years something between a quarter and a half of the population have left Ukraine and millions of them will not come back the combination of the military destruction and the economic destruction and The Exodus of millions of their citizens are major catastrophes for Ukraine okay so the damage done here and I won't even discuss or all of the dead people and all of the Wounded people on both the Ukraine side and the Russian side which number in the hundreds of thousands at least these are catastrophic and as if that weren't bad enough miscalculations like these if they are not corrected if they are not explained so that they can be corrected will be made again and we will see other related miscalculations with equally horrible consequences if we had time and perhaps we can do this on another occasion I would show you that what is going on in Gaza is another similar miscalculation in this case by the israelies about both a military political and economic uh resources that Hamas actually has and this is not a question of whether you agree or disagree with what happened on October 7th or what has happened since those are important questions and I I respect them but I'm asking a different question what kind of miscalculation LED Israel to do something which in my own opinion in the long run is worst of all for Israel but we stay here with Ukraine all right here's my answer to why the miscalculations have happened it lies in something you and I have discussed before but I want to bring it forward now for people to think about every Empire in the history of the world has been born developed and then passed away usually giving rise to another Empire that was emerging as the old one was declining that was true of the Roman Empire the Greek Empire the Ottoman Empire the Persian Empire and I could continue in the 18th and 19th century it was the rise and fall of the British EMP Empire which happened right after the much briefer rise and fall of the Dutch or the Netherlands Empire and in the 20th and 20 into the early parts of the 21st century we saw the rise of the American Empire out of the decline of the British Empire all right here's my argument the American Empire was born some people say in the aftermath of the American Civil War some people say only at the time of World War I and some people wait until World War II but you can disagree about when but no one disagrees the Empire emerged after World War II it systematically replaced the dying old empires of Britain France Germany Russia and so on and so we've seen in the last 70 years the rise the peing of the American Empire it has variously been called the American Empire the American Century the unipolar moment American hemony lots of people have understood its birth and its rise now now we come to my proposition it is now in Decline it has been in Decline for the last 20 years roughly from the crash of 2008 and N from which I would argue we will date the decline of the American Empire it had been hoped that it would never again see a terrible economic crash like the one we had in the 1930s but the crash of 2008 and n and then again the crash of 2020 even though they were called subprime mortgage crash or they were called covid-19 crash these were actually crashes as bad as the one in 1929 the crash in 20 through half the American labor force out of work some for only a few weeks some for a month or a year but a half of the labor force losing its job that's even worse at the peak of the Great Depression of the 1930s in 1933 American unemployment was 25% and that was considered catastrophic it's true the 2020 crash did not last 10 years the way the one in 1929 did it was shorter but it was deeper and these were crashes that were supposed to not happen they were supposed to have been put away by the reforms enacted after the 1930s crash by the development of Keynesian economics which was supposed to include the mon monetary and fiscal policies to prevent to minimize anything like the crash they were shown to be insufficient that's what we've learned in the last 14 years at least next we have learned that the United States cannot Master being the world's policeman it cannot do it even though it has 700 military bases around the world even though it is very rich as countries go and even though it has the most developed military in the world here is the reality it was brought to a stalemate in Korea in 19551 it lost the war in Vietnam in 1970s and it lost the war in Afghanistan to the Taliban who now run that country like the Communist Party of Vietnam ran the country after the defeat of the United States in 1975 and the United States effectively lost the war in Iraq because the dominant influence over there is now Iran which was not the objective of the American intervention and my guess is unless something happens that I don't see we are about to see the loss of the war in Ukraine as well all right these are signs of Empire decline they have always been signs of Empire decline when the Empire suddenly discovers it cannot afford and it cannot win endless battles around the periphery of the Empire to protected that's what's happening the American Empire was Global very ambitious but that requires a global Military presence and that proved to be more than the United States could Undertake and now finally the most important issue of all it's economics the reality in the United States is that for the last 25 to 30 years the American economy has grown poorly it has averaged the GDP increase of around two to 3% depending a little bit on how you count over that time another econom ecomic unit the People's Republic of China has achieved annual rates of GDP growth between six and %. in other words two to three times what the United States did meaning that the gap between the United States and China is closing and closing fast I believe I have given you in the past but it's worth repeating the GDP of the United States and its major allies the G7 added all together is about 29% of total GDP in the world the GDP of People's Republic of China and its allies in the bricks is now 33% of the world's total output the year 2020 was when the two lines crossed before 2020 the United States and its allies was the bigger economic unit since 2020 China and its allies are the bigger economic unit and the gap between them grows each year today as we speak the British economy is in recession today as we speak the German economy is in recession the American economy is growing maybe again two two and a half% the Chinese economy is growing at two to three times that rate even though it's a poor time the Chinese have many economic problems but the Gap is narrowing the GDP of China is now estimated depending on how you count in the neighborhood of 17 to18 trillion do the American GDP is $23 trillion that's a very small difference the GDP of Russia right now one and a half trillion Russia is a small economic entity China is enormous and China and Russia together even before we add Brazil and India I mean we are talking about A Whole New World economy in which the declining wealth and power is G7 and the rising wealth and power are the bricks the miscalculations in Ukraine can be TR traced to the inability of the United States and Western Europe to face the reality they are in what psychologists call Mass denial and that's why they miscalculated they didn't understand that if they didn't buy Russian oil and gas bricks would and that's what happened bricks purchased the oil and gas from Russia and therefore everything that the West had counted on didn't happen the bricks also mobilized the rest of the world China's wealth has enabled them to help half the countries in Africa with major Investments major loans when then the Chinese want support for their view of the war in you in Ukraine they get it that's exactly what used to happen for the United States but it doesn't happen now because there an alternative for every country in Asia Africa and Latin America that has a problem it can go to the United States but it doesn't have to it can go to London or Paris or Rome or Berlin or Tokyo but it doesn't have to it can go to Delhi it can go to Beijing it can go to sou Paulo and it has more resources in the latter than in the former had the people who make the decisions been able and willing to face what I've just said they would have saved themselves the miscalculations that have now destroyed Ukraine and threaten more horrible damage if these miscalculations continue There are finally forces in the world that are working for continued miscalculation and against it I didn't have the chance to develop this last point in the article you refer to so maybe I can briefly mention it here the neocons the the right-wing governments that govern in most Western European countries certainly in Germany in France in Italy and in uh um Brit did I say Britain France Germany and Italy and also the United States and also Japan there are strong forces there that will continue these miscalculations they're the kind of thinking that supports Benjamin Netanyahu in Israel as if that were the only immediately reasonable thing to do and to stay with him him even in the months since October 7 and they terrible miscalculations that threaten the whole world but there's another force and it was on display this week even today in Beijing where you see many of the leading uh CEOs of the largest American corporations Apple computer Google go and many others in Beijing meeting with xiin ping why because these large corporations over the last 23 years have invested hundreds of billions of dollars in China they don't want to lose this investment they went to China because the wages are lower and it's the fastest growing Market in the world and as all capitalists have always understood your chances of success depend on going where the wages are low and the market is growing and they went there and they profited enormously and so did China they want that to continue so the real struggle may appear to be Russia uh China us but it isn't the real struggle is right here in the United States and to a lesser degree in Europe between those Industries those corporations that need and want a continued relationship with China the export Industries upon which Germany depends and it's the strongest economy in Europe they need that relationship with China and so do the Americans so it's a struggle inside those countries between the old war Cold War mentality the hostility to everything socialist and communist the neocon notion that the West is forever hegemonic those people versus the corporate majority who either are already dependent on China or want to be because that's where their future is that's where the profits lie that's where their competitors are busy and they know they better be there too and under the headlines that's the battle being fought out I think one of the important countries in Europe is Germany there is an article recently in financial times it says that Wars in Ukraine and Middle East boost orders at German defense supplier it simply says that Germany is benefiting from Ukraine and Gaza it seems to me that they're trying to shift the focus of German economy the glory of German economy on their military we know the last time they were focused on their military how how it ended up why they're trying to do this to Germany in your opinion well it's all that Germany knows let me be blunt with you and and in in case anyone's wondering my first language is German I speak German fluently and I have all my life and I follow the Affairs of Germany Germany was catastrophically hit by the Great Depression in 1929 without that depression it would never have happened that Hitler was given the government in the in January of 1933 the collapse in Germany was catastrophic between 192 9 and 1933 and this catastrophe followed a slightly earlier catastrophe in 1923 when the Germany had one of the worst inflations in the history of the world where the currency became useless where the collective Savings of the mass of the German people was wiped out and that came just a few years after Germany Lost World War I so in a very very short time we're talking here 10 15 years Germany lost the world war suffered the worst inflation in in world history and the Great Depression it was too much it was a trauma a trauma of misery of suffering of unemployment of a crash of the whole society not just the economy and what pulled them out of that situation was the rearmament of Germany undertaken by Hitler this is obviously not an in uh an endorsement of Hitler Hitler was a horrible leader the I Have Nothing But hatred for everything he represents but not to understand this is to make again the same miscalculation so the Germans learned that the armaments industry and the government focused and prioritized ing that can help them out of bad situations okay now they have a bad situation the thing that gave Germany its Edge for the last 25 years was the combination of very cheap energy from Russia and an advantage in a unified Market because their uh heavy industry had developed further than that of the other parts of Europe France Britain Italy and so on so they could have a special place in the unified Market of Europe and the cheapest energy to serve that market okay so they now have lost that that is a catastroph for them that's why for the first time in many many years they are having a recession two quarters of negative economic growth the literal definition of a recession they lost it's hurting them terribly it's scrambling their society it's disrupting their politics they have a very unstable government because of it Etc now is it true that some of the defense orders that are coming from the war in Ukraine and the war in Gaza are helping some German engineering company of course but the reason you read that in the financial times is the struggle going on inside Germany like in the United States between all the industries hurt by what's going on hurt by the rise in the cost of energy that makes makes Germany uncompetitive with other countries that didn't depend on Russian oil and gas as much as the Germans did those Industries are hurt likewise the industries that used to have a market in Russia and don't anymore those Industries are struggling to change German policy then there are the political right-wing Cold War center right governments that want to hold on to the anti-russia want to hold on to the alliance with the United States are afraid of what will happen to them or to Europe if they don't they don't want to go make a deal with China although that's coming so they don't do that yet they're torn between Russia and the United States and for 50 years they've G with the United States so they want to hold on to all of that they don't want to see the decline of the west or of the United States because it's literally losing their own foundation so they want to continue and they want to make sure that Publications like the financial times put on the front for the mass of the Germans to read we are benefiting in some ways from Gaza we are benefiting in some ways from Ukraine it's true they are but that's because they are fighting these two sides and make no mistake it's a tremendous fight it will determine whether the Olaf Schulz government survives that's what's happening right now just as it will determine and is determining the very possibility of another Trump Administration here in the United States that's the fight but it's the fight of an Empire that's going down that's declining that doesn't know how to solve that problem that does not want to work out with China How To Live and Let Live let me remind everyone when the United States decided to break away from its position as a colony of Great Britain there were two Wars that the British fought to prevent that the independence war of 1776 and then another war in 1812 both times the British were sure they would win they were bigger they were richer they were more armed and they were defeated to their surprise just like the United States was defeated to its surprise so the British then decided we can't force this and they came to an accommodation the United States has to decide will you continue to try to stop prevent undercut smash the Chinese economic Machinery you haven't succeeded so far and I don't think you're going to it's not the way history usually goes the betting will not be on your side maybe you better decide to work something out believe me if and when that happens there will be enormous support which should surprise no one from many parts of Britain France Italy Germany Canada and Japan who will benefit from that alternative way of figuring out what to do and they won't make the same miscalculations that are catastrophic and they always have been you know in the decline of the Roman Empire it was fashionable for Romans to refer to the people on the edges of their empire as barbarians they were known as The Barbarians threatening the Empire it turned out that those barbarians were stronger than the Romans and they ended the Empire how different is it if we call XII ping or uh Mr Putin or we can call them every name in the book demonize them they har it's a silly it's not dealing with the underlying realities that are governing the situation in the end Richard just to wrap up this session in your opinion are we heading toward a new cold war or you see something worse than that I think what we're seeing now is an experiment an experiment led by the United States A desperate experiment to see if we can use a revived Cold War against China and its allies that will give us the period of prosperity that we enjoyed as a nation in the first Cold War the first Cold War was a period of the American Amer Empire's rise you could even date the American Empire from the Russian Revolution in 1917 for the next 100 years that was the period of the growth of the Empire so it's understandable like in the story I told you about Germany that they would once again see well when we demonize Stalin and we said to call the Russians were the evil Communists trying to take over the world and all of that even though Russia never be was even a small kind of economic competitor for the United States never ever the Soviet Union was Tiny relative to the United States never had the the power the size the wealth that the Chinese had he say completely but you know you have to face that reality if you're going to calculate on that basis so I think the United States is making an experiment hoping that a revived Cold War now aimed at China and Russia that ignores the fact that the socialism of Russia was overthrown and that Putin is the enemy of that part of Russian history ignore all of that because that's what you need to deny what's going on if you accepted that Putin is the negation of the Soviet history you'd have to ask other questions why are we fighting him we were supposed to be having a war between capitalism and communism between the United States and the Soviet Union why are we at war with the internal leader who opposed and overthrew the Soviet system but they don't this has to be negated most Americans don't even know that this is the case so an experiment is made and if you you want my guess about the future and that's all we can ever do I think they will discover I think they are already discovering that that experiment is a mistake it is not working the conditions have changed Russia is not China and the world is not divided that way uh it's over and I think therefore there's not much left for the United States they can try militarily to control the situation but that invites nuclear war and none of this is worth that you're not going to win that between the Russians who probably have the greatest nuclear Arsenal in the world and the Chinese who have the second or third biggest one this is suicide and I don't believe that this is likely to be the policy so I think with much difficulty much fakery much dishonesty there will be the recognition to work this out and because the corporate leaders of America include many that want that to happen I think the chances of that emerging after a difficult intermediate period I think those are coming soon but they may require also big political changes tremendous shifts inside the G7 from politics of the right to a politics of the left that there will be a rejection of what has been the political Norm in Western Europe North America and Japan and a reversion to the kind of new deal Franklin Roosevelt solving the problems in a completely different way um that will be more likely the outcome my guess uh than any of the others very good thank you so much for being with us in the is my pleasure Nema and thank and thank you for producing these programs and distributing them it's a very very important service and it is not being done by very many people around the world so my is off to you and I'm sure your audience agrees that these are valuable discussions you're not going to find elsewhere
