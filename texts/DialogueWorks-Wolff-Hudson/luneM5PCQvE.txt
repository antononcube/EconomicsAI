hi everybody today is Thursday December 5th and our friends Michael Hudson and Richard wolf are back with us welcome back glad to be here it's good to be here let's get started Richard with what's going on in South Korea well uh I should begin by admitting freely that I am no expert on South Korea I do not speak that language I have never been there so uh please understand that I'm relying on Public Information in what I uh suggest I'm interested in it and I think we all should be because its connection to what is going on in the larger part of the world and by that I mean the decline of the American Empire the decline of American Capital ISM are very major influences on what has happened and here's how it works but before I go into it for South Korea let me show you the analogies in terms of what's Happening much closer to home a government yesterday collapsed other than South Korea that was the French government which disappeared which was voted out of office uh strictly speaking a no confidence a overwhelming majority of members of the French Parliament the assem uh National voted no confidence in macron's choice of prime minister also starting on Monday of this week 12,000 my apologies 120,000 Volkswagen workers in Germany went on strike uh about nine of their major plants are going on strike and it's most important for me to tell everybody what the strike is over the uh Volkswagen company wishes to close two or three of the nine plants that they maintain there which would mean thousands of people losing their jobs in addition it wants to cut wages 10% and these are are described by the head of it as necessary for the survival of Volkswagen which is if not the largest corporate employer in Europe it is in Germany it's certainly one of them all right let's let's look at this the reality is that in France Germany most of Europe the United States for its own reasons and for its own advantages has subsidized their budgets in their country and it has done so by providing an a defense umbrella basically uh telling them all that they don't have to worry about spending all that much money on defense the United States will do that this of course becomes a subsidy to American um military production but we put that aside for the moment every government then in Western Europe and by the way I'm telling you this because it all applies in South Korea these governments are subsidized to a significant extent by the United States the United States gets benefits from doing that this is not laress this is not charity this is not selfless money giving nothing of the sort but it enables the leaders of these governments to be able to deliver pretty good services to their people with without taxing the way they would have to if they had to maintain a defense appropriate to their situation without a subsidy but the decline of the American Empire is eating away at the ability and the willingness of the United States to do this kind of subsidy and that means more and more step by step the you and this is before Trump has nothing to do with Trump trump only says it a bit more loudly but other than that nothing new what you are doing is you're putting a squeeze on the politicians in these countries one source of support for them their position in the American Empire is the deining because that Empire is declining it can't do what it did before you can see it literally because a major part of the victory being won by Russia over Ukraine is because the collective West led by the United States literally cannot deliver any more weapons because they don't have them they haven't produced them they so all of these budgets are in trouble the United States is running record level multi-trillion dollar deficits uh they're not in a the Germans who used to be the wonderful example of of having a a national debt lower than your GDP now is has a national debt 20% higher than its GDP with no end in sight when when the United States Empire shrinks all of its elements are squeezed because the United Straits tries of course to offload the burden that it can no longer carry Mr Trump if if wers to believe him is about to tell the Europeans you want a war in Ukraine you pay for it I'm out you know I quit I'm not doing it I can't do these things you know I I just won't do it now we come to one little corner of the American Empire South Korea the only time I have seen the behavior of the president of South Korea the one who unilaterally declared martial law and is therefore up for being impeached by his own Parliament two days after he made made that effort right stunning the only other time I've seen him is he visited the White House some months ago and during his visit the president of the United States Mr Biden at the time asked him what his favorite song was I didn't make this up go look it up you'll find it and the man said the name of an American song all think about what it means if you're the president of South Korea and you tell a questioner that your favorite song is not South Korean I mean whoa first rule for a politician don't ever do such a thing but he does it and then the president of the United States says well we would all like to hear you sing it and I'm watching this on my computer screen and the president of South Korea does a good I know the song it's a very famous song he does a really pretty good job of singing it with all the verses in English uh and in tune you know it does a good job okay this is a man who is very close to to the United States as he keeps saying and as Mr Biden celebrates him for that okay he found himself literally weeks after this event he found himself unable to deliver to the United States the kind of support it wants and that he wants to give them because of their Alliance because of the defense umbrella that the United States provides in his case against North Korea and against China by which they are surrounded basically they don't have very good relationship with Japan because of what Japan had done the Korea over the last century or two which is a story for another day okay so he couldn't do it there is a rumor that's all it is I have no knowledge of it but there's a rumor that the United States asked South Korea to produce and ship to Ukraine 155 millimeter uh Howitzer shells artillery shells shows you shows you what kind of this is an Empire on a Sho string they can't do it from the United States they can't do it in Europe they have to go 10,000 miles to to South Korea so he wants to ship to honor his Alliance his place in the American Empire he wants to honor it but he's got a problem the majority of people in in the parliament of South Korea are left of center they will have none of it there will be no shipment and you can't move without it but he took decided he was going to move in other words his loyalty is not just to American Music his loyalty is to do what the Americans want whatever that really is I don't know what it really is but it is symbolized by the possibility that it's artillery shells but whatever it is he can't get it through his own Parliament so what does he do this member of the Dem Democratic American Empire he throws democracy out the window he unilaterally clo you got to get you got to read the proclamation he closes the parliament he dismisses all the people in the parliament he declares martial law which gives him an immense array of powers including shutting down the Press closing the borders uh you know and it's only only only because the left-wing party called out its supporters and they have the majority of people clear majority they even have a majority of seats in the parliament but they have a clear major called them into the streets and said okay we're GNA now we're going to see what you can and cannot do they couldn't they sent crack troops from the Army to do this at the Parliament building and the the leftwing representatives went out they brought the non leftwing the the the cerist the rightest with them and all of them told the troops you can't do this and the troops had that wonderful moment of truth which way are you going to point that gun and they didn't they couldn't and they stopped and at that point of course it collapsed and by the way who collapsed it the president the Minister of Defense that's important because the most uh collaboration between the United States and South Korea is in their military the United States trains their military equips their milit it's all that so obviously the military knew and therefore obviously the Americans knew however long this was planned but it is actually about the declining American Empire and it is very similar in its core explanation for the collapse of the macron government in France and the fact that the German government is two millimeters from collapse already because of the war in uh Ukraine the sanctions and the impact of that on the German economy you know no one bets on Mr Schultz being the the German coun much longer and the the the strike by VW I mean the writing is on the wall but in all cases the Germans can't do they can't do for their people if they're going to have a war like this if they're going to carry their own defense where's that going to come from they're already borrowing Way Beyond what they're normal and that's very nerve-wracking you know Americans have to remember Germany lost two world wars had the worst inflation in modern economic history in the 1920s that's only a hundred years ago that's that's in the mentality of people I heard stories my mother was living in Berlin at the time of the great inflation the 1923 24 grandfather come rushing home with bags full of money which he would give like a a relay Runner to his wife my grandmother who would run I don't mean walk run to the store to spend that money because by the evening it would have lost 2third of its value that's how fast prices were Rising for Americans have never had uh anything like this kind of an experience this is what the phrase runaway inflation really means the Deutsch Mark collaps a country with that in its DNA lost the wars it it it is now in a terrible terrible place which is why you see the rise of a right wing again which is remembering that part of its history and glorifying you know AA fantasy the way we do here but also the rise on the left um both in the Dinka which we had before and now around the former co-chair of the Dinka Sara vagen so I think the South Koreans that this is this is a sequence of symptoms of decline becoming visible tangible you know we talked about it on this program in terms of more the abstract way it's its causes and its Evolution what we're now seeing is its symptom symptom ology its literal presentation in shaping daily life and I think that's what you saw in South Korea Michael jump in I think that Richard's got the Dynamics exactly right and that's what's going to shape the future uh all I can do is uh provide some of the background for that uh from the 1930s to 1940s all the way until 1950 the United States had a huge balance of payment Surplus especially after 1945 when the war ended uh the US just sucked a lot of savings out of uh uh Europe and other places it was a flight Capital Haven in 1950 a uh historic change occurred since 1950 when the Korean War began the United States balance of payments for the first time moved into chronic deficit every single year of the 1950s the 1960s and the 1970s the entire us balance of payments deficit was military spending as I've described in my book on super imperialism with all of the charts uh one of uh and the largest uh mil uh US military Outpost was in South Korea which remains today the largest military Outpost so when Richard talks about the uh until now uh the US Cold War spending uh supporting uh uh Korea uh all of these troops in Korea uh have spent US dollars to buy Korean uh goods and food and all of the other services they have supporting Korea's balance of payments uh so that's part of the uh uh Korea remains a key element of the US uh Empire's balance of payments uh I went to Korea in U 1974 with Herman Khan uh to meet with the president uh there uh to his advisers and U Herman explained uh to the president uh who like all of Korea's presidents were dictators uh that uh actually uh this was the road to democracy uh because he pointed out that uh all of the European countries began as uh Royal States or religious states that there would there had to be a centralized government uh Power an autocracy in order to create and design a democracy certainly to do one American style in Korea so uh he beca he explained uh to Korea and to the American press that uh Korean dictatorship was uh part of the movement towards democracy well after that uh I uh asked about uh the balance of payments in Korea and they took me to a Pharmaceuticals uh company uh looked at the assembly line there they were all women and uh they went to to a factory all the workers were women and I asked you know why is that and they said well in Korea uh it's a very uh male dominated country uh the men are paid four or five times what the women are uh the the the the reason Korea is able to make so many of its exports to the United States and to Europe is because they're made by women uh female labor that is subsidized by uh the fact that the husbands make enough for the whole family because of the male female disparity there a light went off in my mind that that was their whole uh International competition was based on uh male Supremacy o over over uh women and uh the uh you can see how all all of that is unfolded it it it was a an authoritarian country well basically the authoritarian this was back in 1970 for this was 50 years ago obviously there's been uh an increasing protest against authoritarianism in all forms not only uh uh gender based uh but also uh based on uh the United States the uh as the United States protectionism is is increased and is Chinese competition uh in electronics uh and Automobiles has increased Korean uh businesses are being squeezed just like Volkswagen is being squeezed uh in Germany so uh there this is forcing them to decide uh we're about to have Donald Trump come into office he's going to be uh further protecting American industry and that includes against the Koreans how are they going to uh uh operate their economy plus having to Bear uh more and more of the Cold War costs just as EUR is uh being told to Bear the Cold War cost they have to make a decision and you can imagine there's a Rising group within Korea saying South Korea uh do we really want to be part of this constant war with North Korea especially when they're getting so many bombs and uh so much more military power uh do we uh want to REM develop a closer relationship with China and the bricks because that's our Market in other words what's going on in Europe Germany and other countries where is their Major Market going to be uh the Koreans have seen what's happening in uh in in Europe and how they're being sacrificed uh for the United States they uh the question is do they want to be sacrificed in the same way or do they want to say well uh Europe wasn't able to turn toward Russia and China because America told them not to uh but can we afford to make that same choice that Europe did and faced the same problems with our leading chibo the the dominant monopolies China's uh very uh not only is it an autocracy but it's an oligarchy of the big chable the monopolies that they have there that are being threatened by us trade policy and I would be surprised if the Chinese uh uh diplomats are not talking with Korean diplomats and say look uh we can make a win-win why don't you uh you shift our Market we'll support you we you know we'll uh tell North Korea uh your enemy isn't you don't have to worry about South Korea focus on Japan which we can all agree we hate uh and I think that the dynamic that you're seeing now and I don't know what the United States can do because as Richard said it's losing their power I do think that uh Richard's point about Korea selling shells sending shells to the Ukraine must absolutely infuriate uh uh Putin and uh the other bricks members but at the same time uh this has created this uh social and political crisis that uh I think the inherent Dynamics favor Korea's moving being driven by US policy out of the US economic orbit by the way as just a side additional point that that what Michael said reminded me of the chairman of VW when interviewed over the last couple of days about the strike at VW in Germany mentioned repeatedly Chinese competition it's beginning and notice that Michael points out that the South Koreans have also to worry about Chinese competition I see the point I understand it and we knew that but I also think it's becoming a very convenient ideological crutch a a way to avoid dealing with what what is actually happening in which China's development plays a role no question and it is a competitive challenge no question but it's not the reason all of this is happening that's crazy it this is all happening because the evolution of China is part of a decline of another Empire now it's fact able and my guess is Mr Trump is going to ride that horse as far as he can to make it all unic causal it's all about the China who wants to rule the world I mean that's a that's a convenient Trope we we did that with the Russians they all commies wanted to rule the world and so that justified almost anything still does and so this is an easy switch and the fact that it has a grain of Truth makes it that much more useful as an ideological Hammer with which to try to focus the upset that this is causing I mean when the chairman of VW says it nobody in China came up with a cut the wages 10% I mean this is silly but he then becomes merely the messenger the cause is external he just delivered word that it has to happen and that's how the media in Germany the the compliant media they are also handling it uh this way the the other irony is the critics of all of this those who are worried about where Germany is going to end up in all of this those critics are quick to point out whatever may be said about China it's also this war in Ukraine that Deni which was cheap energy imagine how it must play out in a German capitalist mind the the cheap oil and gas that used to come in Limitless quantities from Russia which offset the fact that China was increasingly encroaching on the market that Germany fed remember Germany is an export economy uh machinery and and high-tech that's what Germany's famous for okay China is competing with them China is also a major market and in that market Chinese competition sooner or later is going to Prevail so they have to look at this as the worst nightmare that the country that is their greatest competitor is about to get the cheap energy without which Germany could never have done it in the first place this is a double punch in the face you can't you got to pay a fortune and watch what you can no longer buy find its way to China to fuel even more more efficiency lower prices because they're getting cheap energy out of all of this uh must drive the Germans crazy and it produces right below the surface in Germany I see it all the time remarkable statements by Leading forces in Germany that their biggest problem isn't China it's this business in Ukraine and they want that over they want that done they want to start having meetings with Russia about resuming cheap energy and they want those meetings to start early last week well that may Michael let me play a clip to see what bebok said okay the promise to people in Ukraine we stand with you as long as you need us then I want to deliver no matter what my German voters think but I want to deliver to the people of Ukraine and this is why for me it's important to be always very Frank and clear and this means every measure I'm taking I have to be clear that this holds on as long as Ukraine needs me we are facing now winter time where we will be challenged as Democratic politicians people will go on the street and say we cannot P pay our Energy prices and I will say yes I know so we help you with social measures but I don't want to say okay then we stop the sanctions against Russia we will stand with Ukraine and this means the sanction will stay also in winter time even if it gets really tough for politicians you're mute Nema Michael go ahead well the uh United States has doubled down on European uh German politicians to say uh not only fighting Russia you haven't cut you've only cut off one arm we're telling you to cut off both arms uh you can't trade with China either they've placed all sorts of export controls on uh Germany uh against export and you've had the German uh leaders Schultz and others go to China and saying uh there's something unfair here you're exporting more uh to us then we're exporting to you and I think we've mentioned this in one of our earlier shows China said well there are all sorts of things that we'd like to buy from you like uh the Dutch uh chip engraving agreement you're not allowed to sell us anything that could technically be used for war we can't even buy shoes for you from you because soldiers might wear those shoes so you're you you're defining any export to us as potential war and of course uh we're not buying from you uh and if if you continue to make arms to sell to Ukraine we're not going to sell you the raw materials that you make uh need to make these arms and the Germans like barbach Schulz all of the German leaders except for Sarah vagen conect and the alternative for dland have said uh that's fine our loyalty is to the United States because uh Europe is ruled by NATO the political system of Europe uh European countries is ruled by NATO politically and that means by the ultra right-wing I won't say Neo-Nazi but the people like uh vandan uh who's in in charge of uh NATO so uh what we're seeing what passes for uh German politics is really uh the US uh dominated uh NATO politics and that's uh told Europe to commit economic suicide so the dynamic I think that we begin by talking this show uh about Korea having to make a choice which civilization do you want to be a member of U is exact the same fight that's occurring uh in Germany and the rest of the Europe yeah I would only add that we're watching what I think um is the swan song the final duet between the political leaders of Europe and the United States uh I understand that those people grew up in a in another setting was called a manikan universe a universe of the devil on the one hand and God on the other and there in an endless combat for The Souls of all the rest of us or or something like that and so that the world was neatly divided the evil communist Russia all of that and the Democratic liberal goodness of the West and they made their decision it happened to be good for their career it happened to be pleasing to their parents and so they committed themselves to be the loyal bearers of this wonderful godc connected side of the great battle and they're ready to fight they're ready to fight first of all to the last Ukrainian but they're also willing and notice her language in barbach she doesn't care about the Germans I you my constituent who what yeah then she be then she sticks that adjective Democratic we Democratic politicians almost in the same breath that she says how we are going to be challenged what is what could she possibly mean you just told us you don't you will not be told what the German people want by the German people by the way the PO in Germany and I want to mention this are increasingly making it clear that German people in huge numbers see it as Ukraine versus them they don't see it the way she does and when she says I'm going to do what the Ukrainian people want the latest Gala poll I believe I mentioned this on a on a previous show but the latest Galla poll November of this year for the first time Gallup measures public sentiment in Ukraine for the first time the percentage of respondents in the Ukraine Galla pole who want the war to end the negotiations to begin went over 50% it's now about 53 54% so if you want to play games she can do what the what the ukrainians want unfortunately it's the opposite of what she's about to do nor could she care less I'm going to deliver weapons she's famous in Germany I I read the German press she's famous in Germany she's by far the most anti-russian spokesman in the cabinet of the German government you know she's on the left of that government she's a a green she comes out of the green party but she's more proar than are many of the conservative politicians the the traditional Christian Democratic party which is where the conservatives mostly are in Germany and and as Michael has pointed out it's the far right uh aan and vagen KES and the farle that are the anti- Ukraine War uh forces in the country and that that are big enough to make an enormous difference in their politics but I think you're watching the twisting and the turning the odd remarks like the one you you captured in that video where these politicians are now let me put words in their mouth it's not them it's me here's the word I would put in their mouth the secret conversations I would imagine they're having oh my God hunts or Fritz oh my God have we bet on the wrong horse is it is it time to really re-evaluate the alliance with the United States is it or are we at risk of being taken down with their empire Europe already had lost its own Empire now it is at risk of being smashed further down by having hooked itself up to another Empire that died and no one displays that better and more than Great Britain well Richard You' just made a very smooth segue You Begin by talking about uh Europe's feeling about Ukraine but the Ukraine war is over it's an American war now uh it's America's war against Russia and so uh I I think the Europeans are following your segue and say what they thought and on the surface was a war of Ukraine is really a uh the US side the US Cold War against Russia that that's exactly what it is uh and the problem is that if you look at the career of uh barbach and the green party uh I used to work closely with Ramsey Clark and uh he was protecting the green party at the sense at the time that the United States was uh trying to uh overthrow it and throw its uh leader in jail and the United States uh specifically the National Endowment for democracy uh and other non-governmental organizations began to look around for people who would uh basically Pro Americans to give grants to uh money to uh in order to create a group of politicians who would know what side of the bread was buttered on uh and turned to the US and uh just yesterday I had a postmortem with Joel Stein who's been on this show about you know what happened to the green party uh here she said the US government has been uh FBI and other national security agencies have been trying to flood the green party here uh in the same way they did in Germany with uh people who offered to be volunteers and she said we don't know whether they're crazy people or whether they're plants there's no way of knowing but it's obvious what they want to do is uh take our uh take control of the party well that's exactly what happened to the green party in Germany that began as one of the left-wing alternative party there and was turned around by uh the us subsidy and the US Takeover in the same way that the US took took over the British labor party with Tony Blair uh and other and back the right-wing parties in France and uh uh Italy and other countries so finally the the Europeans are realizing the political system has been poisoned by the uh the the the American oriented uh politicians who've been nurtured by the US sort of a a fifth column and uh they're realizing that uh the political system system has been corrupted what do they do about it that's the that's what they're trying to figure out and of course the us back German government says maybe we should ban the alternative for deuts land so in order for us to support the Nazis in Ukraine and the Nazis in Israel and now the Nazis in Syria idlib and Isis uh we have to call the opponents of uh Nazism Nazis and close them down that's the irony that you're seeing uh in Germany now and uh uh how long can this tension remain without uh an Institutional crisis transforming the whole structure of European politics it's not just that the Europeans could somehow vote to Let's uh support re rment with Russia uh I don't think there can be much of a Repro I think Putin is uh correct when he says it's going to take 30 years for us to be able to trust them again uh and to begin to make uh trade with them again how can Russia trade with them for oil when without Europe giving them back the $300 billion dollars that they've stolen uh there there are just too many too many splits for a short-term easy takeover it requires a social revolution of one form or another to make this smooth this transition uh that you're talking about from joining the US Empire to joining the global majority of civilization it all it also Neema it also makes one Wonder think about the last few years of American politics in which the defeat of Hillary Clinton by Trump was then excused or blamed if you like on the outrageous interference in American politics by the Russians remember the Russia gate and all of that there's there's something stunning going on here the country foremost in the world in systematically using its dominant position coming out of World War II to become the world's policeman to become the funer of of political parties all over in country after country manipulating their polticians manipulating their elections manipulating their media it's been exposed in Congressional hearings it's been exposed in an immense literature that anyone who not can see yet this country exposed as the manipulator abroad par Excellence presents itself to the world not as the performer of such interventions but as the victim we were inter they did can you imagine they interfered and no matter how difficult it was to find the evidence to to show this didn't matter who cared about the evidence there were enough people and it was wonderful for the Democratic party therefore didn't have to question its own politics didn't have to question its own dependence on its own donors none of it it could blame the Russians for which the Democratic party had become famous throughout the Cold War anyway this all came second nature they dusted off the same speech that they had given in the 1950s and 60s adjusted the dates and gave it again it's a stunning when you realize that that's that's almost the epitome for me of the Madison Avenue advertising idea of politics that whatever you're doing write it up as Mom the flag and apple pie you know every Advertiser knows that your job is to take the money from your client and then to say the O only the best things about the product you know about the defects of the product and if the truth of the matter it's not enough to hide it then make up virtues in your product and make up flaws in the product of your competitor which happens all the time every day we all know it we take it in now in routine we don't see it but the minute we stop and ask we see politics is of course taken over Years Ago by Madison Avenue that's what a political race is my advertisers versus your advertisers but we should be aware that it it comes in here that it's the advertiser who says I can portray this as us being victimized by them I will do what's necessary to portray them as the victimizer and I will do what's necessary to portray me as the victim the fact that for the previous half century I have been victimizing a I can push that out of the picture out of the conversation and keep it focused that that's the commitment of an Advertiser and that's why we had even in election lots of speculation revving up again are the Russians or the Iranians or the Chinese manipulating you know as if everybody I remember it Michael you may too I remember reading about the Val the currency exchange rates it became obvious the minute you do any history the governments are always manipulating their exchange the idea that there's an exchange rate and then there's the manipulated one as if you knew what the difference was that's the game you don't you can't and to free the exchange rate from manipulation is the equivalent of going to heaven on a special boat that's not going to happen either well Richard you described the final stage of uh the US Cold War it's about the narrative who's going to win the narrative uh it it can't be won on the battlefield by the United States it can't be won economically by the United States because it's the industrializing all they have left is the narrative uh and uh the advertising and the narrative always ends up in uh a fight between good and evil the whole world now is saying who is the good and who is the evil what kind of society is a good Society is it the deindustrializing Society pushing War everywhere uh and trying to uh engage in regime change and color revolutions uh to say uh we win you lose is Donald Trump would say or is uh the the good uh Mutual multilateralism win-win uh Mutual uh benefit uh what is the good and evil the United States says we're democracy we're good democracy as in Ukraine democracy as in Israel democracy as in what we're trying to do with the Isis terrorists to overthrow uh uh Syria uh democracy is in our plans for war with Iran uh that's the good the evil our countries defending themselves against our interference because we're doing it for democracy and that means American first that means we win how many people can uh untangle their brain to to recreate a reality-based economics and political view of the world that's uh what we're going to be seeing uh in the first year of the Trump Administration by the way in Germany one of the things I discovered talking to some of the people I know is that a kind of inflection point was reached when the uh underwater pipeline from Russia the the gas line was blown up for them this was an act that only an advanced technologically sophisticated Society could do it's comp you have to have machinery and and so it it the German love of irony and sarcasm it has produced an endless array in which it is said so that was the great achievement of Western techn techology was to blow up the pipeline that brought them the energy that enable them to have that advanced technology that self-destructive contradictory behavior is a sign of where we are you know just and they're bitter that they don't have the gas that would have come through that pipeline at this moment it's it it's it's killing them and to think not only that the Russians they can't get it anymore but that literally it can't come because they blew up the it's really for the German mentality that really is too much you're taking one step too much I don't know the German mentality is very flexible yes as all mentalities are but the German word is t too much is to and that and that's the punchline to a series of stories about that pipeline for those who know German in the end or finally or ultimately it was too much too much just before wrapping up this session Richard and Michael we had Donald Trump talking about bricks countries if they're not willing to use US dollar he's going to put tariffs a 100% tariffs on all of them and if we assume that he's going to do that if which is impossible in my opinion but what would be the repercussions of these type of actions on the part of the United States for the people in the United States and in in the west well the United States has prevented Russia from using dollars by excluding it from The Brick from The Swift system uh and the United States is preventing other countries from using dollars for trade with China in a uh broadening array of components and uh if a foreign country uh uh Imports uh from or or exports to China uh any uh computer or other product that has a single element produced in the United States uh that country will be sanctioned so on the one hand uh Trump is saying we're not going to let you use dollars for change on the other hand if you don't lose dollars you're our enemy uh talking uh so it's not only Europe that can think of two opposing truths at the simultaneously uh it's uh Donald Trump where can this go I don't think it'll go anywhere I think the TR will have sanctions against China but the the fact is that uh Russia would say we'd love to use dollars give us back the 300 billion you've taken uh we're happy to transact our foreign transactions in dollars uh as long as they're as good as gold uh as long as they're an international thing it's the United States that won't let other countries use dollars well I think what you're seeing is a number of things on different levels Donald Trump more than other presidents is is a creature of of Madison Avenue his whole life is a endless projection of a a great businessman you know he's he's had I don't know what is it a dozen bankruptcies he's a great negotiator he can't negotiate his way out of a paper bag it's silly right he's just a he he's a showman and he's showing so that always means you have to work at M multiple levels so part of this is showman he won the presidency in part because he's protecting the American working class from all that befalls it all that is eating at it he's going to bring us back a Prosperity he's going to bring back to white men their good jobs he's going to bring back to white men their social position of being the bread winner and blah blah going to subordinate the minorities and women the way they were in the good old days all of that and and I'm going to threaten you you don't do you don't respect the dollar I will Smite you this is this is perfect Madison Avenue imagery and the media are there to project the image which they do okay when it comes to Economic Policy not so much because no one knows quite what to do with this you know you have 50 years of developing a US umbrella for quote unquote relatively free trade okay typical the British did that at a comparable point in their empire too if you're big enough and strong enough and dominant enough then in a free in a free session you Prevail the minute you can't Prevail that way out the window goes your commitment to the free Market you can see that now Mr Trump is he could care less he just got a new Secretary of Treasury who mouths the crap about freedom and privatization and everything that Trump isn't doing but he picked a person who is a will be acceptable to the financial Community he's one of them hedge fund Hustler or whatever exactly he was or is uh so at one level this is all performance but now at a second level if he actually does some of it it will hurt two groups exporters whose stuff is hit with a tariff exporters in other countries whose stuff is hit possibly exporters in this country who will suffer a retaliatory tarff the you know the Chinese respond as do others with retaliation Mr Trump and the media have to keep that story kind of quiet because that looks like the policy has got a a cost to it and that will hurt that you can't have you can't have that so for examp I don't know if if people watching this program no the Russians have seized all kinds of American corporations their Assets in Russia because the the United States stole from them okay we'll steal from you so a lot of them American companies have lost their assets there or they're in limbo until the this gets resolved well the same thing there'll be retaliatory tariffs there already are retaliatory tariffs that are hurting Europe that are hurting the United States in China and elsewhere re best example Trump famously is going to protect us from the invasion of the immigrants and he built a wall did that wall stop immigration not at all in the four years after the wall during the time the wall was built Mr Trump could say well the wall isn't finished okay then when Bren came he made it crystal clear the wall makes no difference immigration zoomed up with the wall relative to what it had been without a wall I mean is silly it's just silly but that silliness has to be kept quiet because you can't have a the advertising mentality is so deep that a product has to have only good qualities that's why you never hear an Advertiser say a word about anything negative the the philosophy is say nothing it even though human beings know it is never always good there's always always some they know it but the advertisers have suspended that's what you get here and if we do have tariffs a lot of them then they will raise the PRI you know it'll worsen the inflation the last month or two the inflation's decline stopped effectively so we already at the point where once January comes if he does the stuff with it with tarff that he says he's going to do starting on the 20th of January well then the inflationary numbers will show up in February in March and it'll happen right away and there are companies that are already doing things that you can see I mean there there's a a horrible story but it needs to be told about um one of the largest Health insurers in the United States anthem Blue Cross Blue Shield they announced that starting February 1st they are assigning a certain number of hours of anesthesia that will be allowed and covered for every operation so that if you have a complication and your operation takes more than the allotted hours one of two things will happen they'll wake you up out of your anesthesia and ask you if you would like to be put back under anesthesia and then they will charge you for however many hours that is try to think about this or you'll make a commitment beforehand or you'll only get six hours covered of the 10 hours that you're operating required and then you can make a claim they say proudly and they will adjudicate they will adjudicate whether some or all of your claim for anesthetic hours will be covered by your insurance notice they're not reducing the premium the premiums are staying the same it's just the number of hours covered is this is an inflation your you're anesthesia the price just went up that's what this is and you know how many companies seeing what's going on are going to get out ahead of the inflation you know if you ever a study inflation inflation is self-cancelling I raise my prices 5% but if all the people I buy my inputs from raise their prices by 5% I'm not ahead so time is of the essence I've got to raise my price before all the others do which is a guarantee that it'll go faster than it otherwise would anyone who studies this knows this but you have the American public that can be told all of this and the Tariff is viewed how we're gonna get that's why the president had to say China will pay the Tariff we put on Chinese goods and to this day polls show that a a a big majority of Americans think that the tariffs are paid for by the Foreigner by the Chinese you they don't no one has explained to them that that's not that that's not how it works but why would you do that why would you make that mistake because it's advertised you you have to be able to say tariff is good it's successful it does the job it can't have a drawback it can't have a negative it can't and I'm going to be interested as an observer of clowns how Mr Trump is going to manage the Absurd contradictions of the policies he announces well an anthem's uh act on an anesthesia uh worked pretty well for Bill Clinton he said I feel your pain it's sort you could turn it around uh but regarding the uh the tariffs I think the the situation is much worse uh than just tariffs uh you've described how tariff will increase uh the price of uh uh Imports but uh they've already there's already a sanctions War uh and U China has announced the other day that it's not going to export a very broad array of essential raw materials and essential uh manufactured inputs that are necessary for American production to take place for computer chips for computers for cars for washing machines for all sorts of things we've discussed in the last few shows some of the uh sanctioned Goods that China says uh America can use our gallium our germanium our Rare Earth elements are uh the whole array that we've been discussing to make milit AR Goods to fight in Ukraine and just as uh America has blinkin has gone to China and said don't export these Goods to Russia they can use them for military goods uh the Chinese have turned the tables on the United States and said absolutely right we don't want to export goods to any country making War because we're against Wars so we're not going to export to you the goods that would help you uh wage war in the Ukraine with uh all of your military applications uh you know can't even sell your shoes your soldiers might wear them I'm exaggerating there but that's the uh how broad the whole approach is so what this is going to do uh is cause Supply breaks uh in the in the supply chain and uh that will mean that these Goods simply will not rise in price they won't be made they won't be available here so we're talking about a break down uh in uh the supply chain and the essentially countries will have companies are going to have to finance uh caring charges for inventories they'll probably do here what Volkswagen did in Germany and saying well we can't really uh employ uh the labor force to continue to make products that uh require certain inputs that are only available to China we have to wait until all of this is over Well we I'm sure that neither of us I don't know if anybody has read the 200 Page list of uh products and all of the special exemptions that lob lobbyists have put in to these uh trade uh blocks to prevent uh certain companies uh especially if you're a large contributor to the Republican party from being shut down but uh I think China has ways of getting IR this they're not going to Simply say oh okay we're going to send our raw materials and ra Rare Earth to uh Vietnam to send to the United States if they see some country simply uh or company in increasing uh the degree of sanctioned uh products they can uh have a pretty good idea about how to stop that so uh we're talking about something much worse than tariffs since the rising prices we're talking about shutdown of companies and layoffs and of course there will be an inflation for goods that are not being produced the price will not reflect the higher cost of production as a result of tariffs it'll it'll be the whole scarcity of goods that are not being produced that's what what the Americans are going to be facing after January and just as a footnote when products start disappearing then you're going to see ramifications that nobody has even figured out what they're going to be I mean I I've been going around the country talking to people about what it means that an electric vehicle which is now best produced most efficient cheapest highest quality is a Chinese electric vehicle so happens well those are not allowed here have 100% tariff so it's a kind of a case study but the Ram ifications of that are staggering they have and they're not just economic in the sense that um a a competitor of the US can buy the best cheapest truck for their business if they're located in Canada if they haven't copied the US I don't know but his competitor five miles away across the Canadian border he can't buy that cheap high quality low price truck and the competitiveness between them is thereby affected how are you going to handle the losses of jobs here and there that come from this kind of be no one is explaining to the American people what the costs of all of this are I mean it's ex it's extraordinary it's like the remark Trump made about how the the revenue from the tariffs is going to allow him to cut taxes on corporations I it's fantastic you know just what you C do you know what kind of Revenue is going to flow you don't I did like that he did it because inadvertently he taught the American working class who doesn't understand this I know I I go to meetings I explain it to people they don't seem to understand that there's something remarkable about the leader of the Republican party that has spent the last century presenting itself as the anti-tax party having an economic program whose centerpiece is the raising of the Tariff tax uh hello what is that about what happened to all that rightwing stuff that Michael and I have had to endure in our professional careers about the government shouldn't be picking winners and losers what the government shouldn't be intervening the go this is we we're seeing maximum intervention by a republican it's wonderful to watch it's like Nixon when he was famously quoted as saying we are all keynesians now all right we'll keep going forever thank you so much for being with us today Richard and Michael great pleasure as always okay same here same here see you
