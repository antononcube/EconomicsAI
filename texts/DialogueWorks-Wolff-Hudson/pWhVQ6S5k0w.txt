we had an interview with Putin Tako Coulson went to Moscow to do this interview how did you find this interview how important was that you know an interview especially one that lasts as long as that one did which was much longer than these kinds of interviews usually are uh but an interview like that is usually an opportunity to do two things number one to get a condensed summary of the official position on a range of subjects so in this case we knew in advance the key subject would be uh the war in Ukraine and what it means and why it's that happening and so forth so you would get a condensed statement from the leader of one side well how they understand the purposes and the problems of the War uh it would and I would re look for That interview in the same way that I would look for an interview of Mr zalinski um on the Ukrainian side or possibly Mr Biden on the United States side the second thing one looks for in an interview like that is whether there is something new and there's something new information a new kind of emphasis a new Point indicating an openness to ending a war because a war is a is something that assumably we all want to end uh as soon as possible so I looked at the interview with Mr Putin to see if there were any new items anything different any emphasis that had changed that would be a reasonable basis um to speculate to hope for something and to talk about that so and and I do that with all these kinds of things I'm never disappointed that it's that that part of it is just the official line being presented because that's what it's for a a press conference with Mr zalinski would be full of that and they have been and press conference with Mr Biden are full of that and they have been and you likewise look for something new which is sometimes there or a change of emphasis so I found Mr Putin's uh interview with u Tucker Carlson perfectly u in line with that there were a few I wouldn't call them new things it was mostly a a statement of a position I found it very very interesting that he spent that first half hour on the the ancient history of Russia and and and Ukraine not so much because there was new information uh I'm a professor of economic history I'm familiar with that but it was interesting that it was so present in his mind that he was so concerned to talk about that history to make his audience aware of that history other than that I thought he did a perfectly reasonable job I didn't think it was terribly brilliant but I didn't think it was a disaster either he got across the Russian view of all of this um and I thought that he did that perfectly uh reasonably we could you could have asked him some more questions on the other hand it was a long interview um it is not Tucker Carlson fault nor Putin's that there are so few I am frankly ashamed of the mass media in the United States um I don't expect much from our government anymore it is really it has reached a level of of disconnectedness where it's more pathological than it is interesting as a topic that there's there's not much there uh the symbol ISM of having the same old men who were the oldest who ever ran four years ago to be once again the oldest to ever run I mean it's pathetic it is a kind of a wow these two countries can't do better excuse me this country can't do better than these two candidates wow what a statement anyway uh I found it disgusting to see the the media line up and attack Tucker Carlson he's a journalist he's not responsible for what the people he interviews have to say he really isn't he asked a lot of questions uh and he went about as far as you can to be aggressively impolite I know some Americans think that's great journalism it usually isn't what it does is it irritates the person you're asking questions to and then you don't get a thought through answer you get a kind of push back and why this is attractive I don't know is I never understood it um it the real flaw here is let me put it this way a great thinker and I don't remember who it is but a great thinker once said that the first casualty in every war is the truth that what wars do is make people lie terribly each side tells unspeakable stories about how awful the other side is and how wonderful they are war crimes are always committed by the other side and you are noble and you care for PE it's and nobody in their right mind believes this anymore so you the only strange thing is why people talk like that it's very strange you know we should have had Mr Putin interviewed all the time he should be interviewed you know by this person and that person one question here another question there what's the fear by not allowing him to have a chance to speak to the American people what you're doing is suggesting to the American people that we have something to hide which we probably do cuz it's been suggested to me let him speak you know let him speak you can make a criticism afterward you can question him you can do all of that but the idea that he shouldn't be allowed to speak this is a very crude and unfortunately very a bad American habit we call it here the demonization of your opponent it it it comes out very bad religious wars in the Europe which led to the colonization of the United States in many ways so that the people came were uh parts of sects that were being persecuted for their religious beliefs and so it wasn't matter that God preferred you to to them or say all these dramatic exaggerations of what we were all doing was being human beings trying to find a way to live a way to build our societies and so on very very bad habit and you see it here inside the United States these days where people call each other every name in the book and there's a constant desire to demon every the Trump is a criminal Biden is a criminal they are stealing they are murdering they this this endless overdrawn drama wow it it doesn't help solve any problem it makes communication more difficult and it makes these interviews more rare so again my feeling is I'm glad Tucker Carlson broke that pattern had the courage uh to try according to Carlton in other interviews he was working for at least three years trying to set this appointment up and that the the Russians didn't agree because of activities by the United States which didn't want Carlson to do it I mean this is what he says uh and nobody has refuted him so I'm willing to give him the benefit of the doubt in this interview when tuer Carlson asked him about the relationship between Russia and China who comes to two key points he says that the China's foreign policy is not aggressive it's all about compromise and cooperation why we are having such difficulties when it comes to these superpowers they can communicate to each other okay I should explain that I I watched the interviews with as much interest in learning about Tucker Carlson as I did in learning about Russia Ukraine and vadir Putin and I came away feeling I had learned very much about Tucker Carlson that I had not understood before which I am grateful for because I think Tucker Carlson is an important person in American history in the way that he is now changing and I think it's worth our discussing that because it is for your audience important to see the broader changes that are signaled by what is coming out of the mouth and the the life of Tucker Carlson uh but to answer your question first I think what Russia means is that they have discovered that despite profound tensions conflicts and disagreements between them and the Chinese they have been able even before the war in Ukraine well before the war in Ukraine to work out a an arrangement of cooperation compromise and so on just to remind an audience that may have forgotten it's not that many years ago that China and Russia were at war with one another they had military conflicts over borders over they had profound disagreements on the policy to take in relationship to the war in Vietnam and a whole host of other issues that brought them to physical blows okay all of that had to be rethought had to you had to work out some compromises they have some disagreements that there's still some leftover issues um in the in the Pacific Ocean in the in in the boundary areas up there between Japan China and Russia in the north and so on so there's a lot of compromise and adjustment that had to be worked out over recent decades between those two countries it is not a simple coming together in the face of the United States or anything like that they were in Greater Danger from the United States back when they went to war against each other than they are now and yet they had that war they took those risks so it means a lot when Putin says it's he's talking about what they had to do to work all of that out uh number one number two uh who Putin clearly proceeds with a deep historical awareness and I have to tell you in all honesty that American uh politicians don't do that it's not that they don't do history but they do a fantastic history a make believe a history of an imaginary I mean you can literally see it now uh president former president presid Trump calls his movement make America great again so he has in his mind an idea of America great again although most of the things he points to weren't great 40 years ago and they were even less great 80 years ago what is he talking about he's not really talking about how what conditions were imagine telling for example a female in America or a black person in America or a Hispanic Latino immigrant he wants to make America like it used to be it used to be a country of of horrendous Jim Crow racism of discrim women have only had to vote for barely a century in this I mean how far back do you want to go and the further back you go the worst the conditions for non-whites and women right away that's a majority of our people okay I mean ah what are you talking about it's not a real history it's a fantasy history very very different you have the feeling that Mr Putin looking at him and listening again to that remarkable historical lecture that he is more aware than Americans are that there have been multiple efforts to force Russia to subordinate itself to military attacks coming from the West uh let's review okay let let's let's really do this carefully there's the invasion of Russia at the beginning of the 19th century by Napoleon attack Russia invade Russia determined to take Russia over failure then there's the Soviet revolution in 1917 immediately following the revolution an attack from the West mostly the United States France and Britain with a A partnership of Japan invade the new Soviet Union trying to change its regime the war there the civil war with the foreigners involved l last three or four years roughly 1917 to 1921 and it is a failure okay between those two you had World War I which is again an attack on Russia this time from Germany and you have it again in World War II with Hitler every single one of these four distinct attacks failed Russia defeated everyone the so the record the modern historical record of fighting a war in Europe against Russia is West zero Russia four now that doesn't prove anything about the future it doesn't mean we know what will happen next time but it ought to make you be very very careful about attacking the the Russians or the Soviet Union these are people who have demonstrated not a good idea very likely you are going to be defeated and to make sure that no one misunderstands me I follow as close as I know how the war in Ukraine I have now become aware over the last three or four weeks of how that war concentrated in the city of adeva yeah sorry about that but it's clear to me from uh bakut for before to this city now Ukraine is losing the war and Russia is winning the war and that should surprise rise no one the United States cannot use the nuclear weapons that it has because that's crazy given what the issues are you wouldn't you and short of nuclear weapons you're not going to defeat Russia nobody ever has this is this is not rocket science folks this is very strange politics that go in here okay so I think Mr Putin knows all of this and understands the array of forces he doesn't make the kinds of slips that Mr Biden does in speaking and he doesn't make the kind of slips Mr Trump does in speaking no one can miss that you can pretend not to notice but that's what it requires pretense otherwise you can see what's going on so I am trying to look at it from an American perspective seeing him as the leader of an important country in this world against which we have conflict all right now a word if I can about the conflict there is something deeply suspicious here that ought to be asked but by American Media never is and it was alluded to by Mr Putin during the interview and Tucker Carlson could have done more with it although he did take it further than most American reporters are willing to so I I want to be fair to Mr Carlson okay here's the reality for the entirety of the Cold War roughly from the late 194 40s until the collapse of the Soviet Union the enmity between the United States and the Soviet Union was presented to us by every single American leader as a fight between capitalism freedom and democracy on the one hand and socialism communism and dictatorship on the other it was a noble struggle of one set of political and ideological commitments against another when the Soviet Union collapsed in 1989 and when they went through their change what emerged was a new government completely opposed to the Soviet Union it dismantled its socialism it it converted State Property to private property in large part not 100% but it's not 100% anywhere in the world including the United States it denounced socialism and it made come the Communist Party a minor political organization as it is in many countries Mr Putin emerged as the leader of the anti-soviet new Russian Federation in the course of that he proposed as did all the European countries a completely new relationship with the West now that the ideological political conflict was no longer there there was no longer the democracy versus socialis ISM communism now one of two things happened either they could not work this out or as Mr Putin presented it he asked to become part of NATO to to overcome the division and the West refused I don't know the details and for what I'm about to say it doesn't matter but to discover today that we are told as we are that Mr Putin is the same thing as Stalin was and that that equation is made all the time by all kinds of commentators political leaders and others Putin and his thugs you know you we are presented with an image very like what I grew up in here in the United States hearing about Stalin but then later grof and later you know filling the blank all of them that is very suspicious this looks like we have to have an enemy and if it is in one kind we'll make the next one an enemy too I mean Russia and the Soviet Union are radically different in a thousand ways that I can explain to you and that anyone who studies them sees why would we have the same hostility and enmity using the same language to describe the same leader who is so opposed this is extraordinary and one ought to wonder how much of this is a problem between the United States and Soviet Union on one hand the United States and Russia on the other there could be some problems of course between them but how much of it is the United States being a society that always needs a terribly dangerous foreign enemy maybe that's the behavior of a country that can't hold itself together any other way maybe that's the behavior of a country made up of one wave of immigrants after another who suspicious of each other who worry about each other who don't trust each other who need an external enemy and if one goes away they got to find another one come on you don't need advanced psychology to at least ask the question all of that struck me as in that interview but not explicit not put into the words that Tucker Carlson could have and should touched upon hinted at but not really wow and by the way in much of the world whether the Americans like it or not but in large parts of the world Putin's idea is widely believed I don't know if it's true or not I'm not commenting on that but it would be stupid not to understand that in many parts of the world what Putin says that this is an attempt by the United States to push NATO closer and closer to Russia and to threaten Russia completely around you know from Bulgaria in the South to Finland in the North and the whole thing everything that was done after World War I to create that Cordon San as the French called it that row of countries that would be a barrier the barrier is gone all those countries are now in NATO or are about to become that or like Ukraine are trying to do that and the Russians feel endangered look they have been acting and saying this endangers us for a century they have said it is an existential threat they have drawn the famous red line I they've done everything you can ask to make the point including now going to war invading uh Ukraine okay uh the world large parts of the world believe that part of this story is the expansion which means that part of a way out of this war would be be if that's not the intent then say so have a commitment of everybody in the world that that Ukraine doesn't join NATO and that whatever economic relationships it has will not become political and or military my understanding of the meetings that were held in Istanbul and in Minsk During the period before the war begins and just after it starts those were the issues on the table it could have been and again I'm not sure that's 100% right that's what I've been told I find the work of the Chicago University professor John mimer very helpful he's a real specialist in this kind of work and has written and commented in great detail from which I have learned I don't mind saying so but if I understand it correctly these are ways we could end this horrible War uh and and yet what I get is a refusal and I I cannot as an American I cannot help but notice that the war in Afghanistan was clearly also lost years ago but it took years before any president could dare bring the troops home but it seems it's very hard for domestic political reasons that the other party will attack you for having lost the war which is clearly a con a bipartisan achievement to Lost War this is a war that never should have begun in the first place etc etc so all all of this seemed to me um the core of what was important about the interview and I think Mr Putin uh whether we like it or not that's another matter but he was effective in giving the world a sense that they have a position that they have their grievances uh and that makes a certain sense what they did so why don't we stop this silly game why don't we congratulate Tucker Carlson for having had the courage to go out and have an interview which is useful for all of us to have seen and beyond that my God it reminds me of my worst teachers who didn't want the students to have any critical perspective for fear it would poison their minds we all got the critical perspectives we all knew where to get them and whatever poisoning of our minds it might have achieved uh we would have had it one way or the other what would have been better if you had talked to us dear teacher and presented it honestly we would have learned it better and we would have had more respect for you but that's a lesson that either you learn early in life uh or you don't the rest for me what's most important to be honest with you is Tucker Carlson and if I could indulge you I would like to talk to you a little bit and to your audience about some important insights into what is going on here in the United States that you can get from the interview by Mr Carlson of Mr Putin it wasn't the point but it was by far the more important Revelation okay what you saw in Mr Carlson and what you have seen in a number of the interviews he has given since the interview with Putin because he has been challenged by other media folks like fared Zachariah and others who have attacked him mostly attacked him very few have defended him uh and I'm not here I'm not interested neither in the attack nor in the defense I'm not interested in the attack because basically I think it is um mean-spirited what what they're really doing is attacking Mr uh Carlson because Mr Putin comes off as what he is a political leader he's strong he's coherent and he's effective he knows how to smile occasionally Etc I think the the the reason they're angry is because he doesn't come off as the monster he has been presented as to the American people which he couldn't because that was a fantasy anyway he is what he is he's the product of the Russian system as it has evolved after 1989 and to some degree of the Soviet system before that he grew up in that he is a product not more not less that's what he is he's not a monster he's that so it's it's just and and everything Carlson says about his trip to Moscow has the same quality it's he recognized that this Putin is the leader of Russia impressive in some ways unimpressive in other ways a product of his society and his time but that means he's not the the Hideous woman monster that he was led to expect and if you follow um Carlson's interviews later you'll notice there there are Clips he visits a supermarket in Moscow and there he has his little cart and he's going down the aisle and he grabs a bunch of bananas and puts them in his cart and a a plastic wrapped what looks like meat or bread or something and he talking about I can look at me I'm in a shopping C he's in a shopping uh place he's in a supermarket it's like a million other supermarkets it's in no way remarkable as a supermarket he's Amazed by this why because he imagined a Russia that was monstrous and therefore didn't have the everyday things like a supermarket with bananas and wrapped meat and bread he talks about gee and when I when I paid for it it's cheaper than it cost in the United States you see again what did he imagine it would be much more he imagined and then he shows you in in other clips that he had taken his team took pictures there's a picture of the Soviet uh excuse me uh it is the Soviet but the Russian subway system for those those of you that have never been to Russia and never been to the subway it's spectacular it it it it's beyond beautiful and the way it is done it's Crystal Clean it it is carefully constructed beautifully maintained I mean it's extraordinary so most Americans are not aware of that if if you live in New York as I do you're used to a subway system that is dirty and broken BR en and really ugly most of the time right that's what it is it's it's better in other American cities in fact but it's no great shakes in most cases nothing like the Moscow Subway and he's in transed as tourists have been for a long time if you go on any kind of tourist trip in Moscow they take you into the subway to show it to you because it is a showpiece so he he does all that and then he says look at this look at this and fared Zachariah to knock him says something which only shows that fared is a hack politically and not a serious thinker he makes a terrible mistake he says oh oh poor Mr Carlson was taken in in every dictatorship or some words like that Zachariah says there are always pet projects that they put a lot of money in to Showcase that they have done something beautiful why is Zachariah wrong because if you go to the Paris Subway which has never had a Soviet period you will also see a beautiful clean subway system as you will in many other countries you don't need a Soviet Union you don't need a dictatorship to have a decent Subway that's Mr Z Zariah wanting to squash Mr Carlson much better to learn look what's going on here he expected something monstrous and he discovered something beautiful but the mistake here is Tucker Carlson's what's what he's telling us what he's showing us is that he and he says this he was led to believe things about the Soviet Union and about Russia that were crazy that were fantasies just like they were led to believe about Mr Putin and then Putin is No Angel and Russia is no Paradise it never was and it wasn't under the Soviet Union either but the crazy demonized horror show the monstrosity painted here that people growing up in America like Tucker Carlson and like me that's what we grew up with so it turns out that when we reach a certain age for some of us high school for some of us college for some of us full career like Tucker a moment comes and that's where Tucker is when he realizes he has been lied to he has been misled he has been miseducated and he's not only upset to learn it but he's angry why was this done to us why have we been told this silly story why does and then he gets angry now why does fared Zachariah who has intelligent things to say sometimes what why is he so upset why is he making this mistake you don't need a dictatorship to have a beautiful clean subway system Paris is famous for its clean subway system and it never had a Soviet dictatorship not for one minute so what what is this what's going on here fored Zachariah is holding on to the monstrosity he needs to say that the beautiful Subway is a great exception that these folks these evil folks sometimes put resources in to fool us all with the pretty subway stop fared wake up you've been drinking the Kool-Aid too long and all Tucker and Tucker Carlson wants is to have some other people join him in saying wait a minute let's go look let's go see let's have the truth he's bitter and he says so and I think here I'm going to go out on a limb little bit but for those of you that want to understand the United States you are watching something very important yes Tucker Carlson was once with Trump and with Maga and with the right wing and with Fox News and with all of it and he was gungho and when he's asked what's wrong he he likes to give what passes for Theory among those people the theory that all the bad things that are happening are the result of a government a government is doing bad things it's never the capitalist system it's never the economic social totality own that's great oh that's great they we drink the Kool-Aid Capital bad government get rid of those evil Democrats bring in the Republicans who know how bad government can be and will keep it from being bad this childish mentality which doesn't ask The Logical obvious question that ought to keep all Libertarians up at night if the government is doing bad things why is it doing bad things who is making it do that who runs the government is it your typical worker who becomes the president no it's your typical employer is it your typical employee who becomes the Congress person no it's your typical employer you get the picture why the government is and who the government is ought to be your question by not asking by making the government the bad guy all you're doing is protecting all of the forces that make the government do what it is you don't like and why are you doing that and whatever your answer is my response is I sure hope you're getting paid well for the service you're performing Tucker Carlson is at a crucial point and how many million Americans are with him they're realizing they've been told nonsense about capitalism socialism communism Russia and many more topics they now know that what they're told about the Ukraine war is a carefully packaged propaganda story but it's clear what's going on here and it's clear to Tucker Carlson now that's part of why he wanted to go he wanted to see can Putin make a case or is he just going to stand there and be the Hideous monster that we portray him as has you know the United States for years before the war in Ukraine used drones to kill large numbers of people in Iraq in Afghanistan and elsewhere the breast beating now for people's for Naval in Russia I mean it is so f that that you takes your breath away it's inappropriate to jail your opposition absolutely it's horrible to put them in jail let alone to kill them no question but take a step back and ask who is who is talking to whom about what the United States invaded four of the poorest countries in the world Vietnam Laos Iraq Afghanistan biggest most powerful military in the world invading the poorest and then his outrage when Russia invades Ukraine what the ability to live in a world where the United States can just do do these things and I'm not even going to talk now about bombing Yemen bombing Lebanon Syria what issuing a statement we are not interested in escalating the war on the same day that you escalated who do you think is fooled by this so for me Carlson is realizing there's a lot of fooling going on and he doesn't want to be the fool and he's angry that he was made the fool he's embarrassed by the things he say he's saying that now I'm changing he said I'm glad I'm changing I learned things I've got to change look at the supermarkets they have in Russia look at the subway station they have look at this what I'm learning my God and now let me make this prediction the model for where Mr Carlson is going is the new left of the 1960s and 70s in the United States why because there was the same situation A young New Generation grew up they grew up in the late 1950s and 60s it was a time when they were told in class that the United States was the land of Freedom equality democracy opportunity and so forth and as they grew up and went to college and took a job during then the 60s into the 70s many of them discovered that this wasn't true that large numbers of people black ones brown ones female ones poor ones rural ones less educated ones the vast majority didn't have freedom equality or opportunity wow they felt betrayed they felt lied to the America they had led to believe was their environment wasn't slowly they began to understand when they were shocked to discover that the land of freedom and opportunity was busily mowing down hundreds of thousands of people in the jungles of Vietnam for what for what these poor people were no threat to the United States 10,000 miles away what and they slowly began dimly to understand that the United States was the new Global Empire that it was busy replacing the now defunct British Empire finished in World War II by itself and it was organizing and showing the world we are the new Empire whether it's Vietnam or Guatemala or Iran whether it's arbans or mosad or anybody else we're in Char we will deter and of course this involved killing people Wars Devastation yeah and that didn't look good and a whole but you know for those people in the 60s and 70s the theoretical air was coming from the left that's because of the Great Depression the rise of socialism and communism here in the United States that put all that kind of thinking in the air so that young people trying to understand their feeling of betrayal had a leftwing explanation Tucker Carlson never had that he grew up in an America that hated the left that was busy moving to the right that wanted nothing to do with Socialism or communism wanted to believe in robust capitalism that the government had to be kept away because it was inherently somehow bad this was the theoretical framework they had to work with wasn't much wasn't very welldeveloped but it's what they had so they went with that as they now undertake what happened to the new left in the 1960s they began to learn they began to study they began to realize they had to rethink the left they had to ReDiscover Marxism and socialism and find out what is and isn't useful and they've been doing that ever since and a whole new kind of socialism and Marxism are emerging the work is paying off taking time but it's paying off I suspect the same is underway now on the right and Mr Carlson may very well become an important leader if he can stay with his quest if he can dare to question the libertarian uh Theory I'm being polite here uh that he has embraced ask the question why the government is what it is when he's upset about it why the government lies why the government goes to war why why he is smart enough and he's acute enough to get there and there will be others whether Tucker Carlson is among them or not who will we're going to see the splintering up of the right as it tries to come to terms with what it has to face which is the horrific gap between the reality of us capitalism at this point and the fantasy story that has been told for half a century now it's a story that cannot survive in in our in my period it couldn't survive the cost of the Empire the Vietnam War the the inequality at home the fakery in international relations for them it can survive the end of the US the decline of the Empire is going to be impossible they can't there's no place in their Universe for it and it's going to eat at their self-confidence over and over again I think that's what's going on and I think what the interview by Mr Carlson of Mr Putin I don't think it changed Mr Putin all that much but I think it's a major step on the road to a Mr Carlson breaking away from what what he was quitting Fox News or pushing until they pushed him out breaking that connection that was part of it forming his own was part of it being now able on his own to make ideological breaks like talking to Mr Putin like the other comments he's made remarkable he was asked in an interview you which caused Great concern about what does he say Mr Putin uh killed Mr naal the the opposition person uh who died in the prison and he gave the proper answer which horrifies everybody he said I've learned that political leaders kill people you know what that let me translate he always believed that the monster evil other like Putin killed people what he's saying is he knows they all do and you know what that means he knows that his own leaders do it too he's no longer captured by the illusion of the we're good they're bad dichotomy monsterization of the evil other that kind of politics childish widespread in the United States is in the process of losing one of the intellectuals it needs it has used and it has now lost one of the points that P made during this interview considering the economy of Russia he said that more than 50% of Russian trades before this war started in Ukraine was in dollar right now it's below 133% this is a huge change for 19 months how do you see this type of Behavior coming from these governments who are not accepting the way they were treated by Washington well I wouldn't go quite so far as you are going I I think this reflects the fact that Russia is now much more reliant on India and China than it used to be on the bricks than it used to be he's right that was underway before the war in Ukraine it's accelerated I think over the long run there's no question that the dollar will decline in its importance however I expect I I could certainly be wrong I expect that it will take time for that decline to happen I do not expect it will be in a straight line you will see it decline sharply then it will revive for one reason or another uh countries like India or Saudi Arabia you know could make political changes there that reorient how they trade and and and the United States has not exhausted the measures it can take to restore the confidence in the dollar I think the direction of change is question but the exact pace and so forth I don't think we can see that that that that's something that you can only measure in years not not in weeks or months uh but really only in years and probably in years not only those years of a war when when when the War uh kind of shapes it the United States is in a period of Decline and there is nothing let me underscore that there's nothing nothing I see or nothing I can see pointed to by others that suggests to me that that decline is going to be reversed or stopped I mean if I saw something I would say it but I don't I just don't see it I mean every day it seems to me I see evidence of the other way around I'll give you an example today's headlines are full of over the last two or three days of of uh stories about how the leading airline in the world the company that makes airplanes Boeing uh an American company is having more and more difficulties it cannot make airplanes except the kind of crash or or have their doors fly off in the middle of the flight as many of you know uh it's having one problem after another meanwhile the the the comac corporation a Chinese company uh just unveiled its new international uh airplane the c919 which for the first time is being offered to the whole world it was available in China it has now been purchased for the first time by an Indonesian Airline which will use it but there you have it the decline of something as crucial to the future of the world as Airline traffic the decline of the old am Pioneer and the arrival of the new China I mean this story is repeated with electric cars it's repeated with lithium batteries it's repeated repeated but that's the point it is the the the direction is unmistakable
