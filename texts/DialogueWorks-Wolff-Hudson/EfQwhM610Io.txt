Michael let's get started we're GNA have Richard today but he about to to arrive here but let's get started with Michael Michael how do you find this Russian plan for cryptocurrency in order to facilitate bricks trade well I I think it began uh being talked about already uh a year ago uh at the beginning certainly of 2024 is the unit and it was developed as a kind of Bitcoin plan uh very anti-government they said the whole purpose of this is that it's non-political and it's hard money it's just like gold it's not governments will have no role to play in this at all and basically it's going to be for uh investor private investors corporate uh uh investors uh basically to save uh what they didn't say is who's going to get this money who's managing the fund the indication is a group of private investors have already bought a whole group of uh Russian Bitcoins or cryptocoins uh and uh they want to get other people to jump in and uh begin buying them and uh it's promoted by the most recent Russian uh press releases is this is going to be a crypto way of getting around the American sanctions against uh Imports and imports and trade and investment in Russia uh but all of the promotion is uh this is going to be a way to make money and uh this Russian coin is going to be based uh ostensibly on uh gold on Russian currency uh Chinese currency and Bricks currencies but suppose that you uh you pay money and you buy uh the Russian Bitcoin how is this money going to be invested is it going to be like Sam bankman freed and uh they can invest it in anything they want uh or is it going to be run by the Russian Central Bank and the Russian Central Bank will either convert this money into rubles or will use this money to do uh what it's supposed to do to buy gold and to buy these other currencies uh to buy uh Chinese currency and uh uh bricks currencies there's no indication at all of uh what who's going to manage it uh whether it's uh going to be able to go up and down it's supposed to be based on gold and currencies but uh so are uh stable coins and the stable coins and the Bitcoins are going way up uh relative to these prices uh are people going to somehow make this into an investment vehicle and if that's the case and it's set by the open market uh then how how is this going to create stability uh for the the governments that are using it in the first version of this Russian stable coin uh the unit they said this is uh we're following this from Fon me and Hayak and Mandel uh we hate governments the governments will have no role to play only we will have a role to play and because it's crypto uh we don't have any any idea of what's happening so uh suppose that you're an exported Russia and you want to uh get around the uh American uh sanctions European sanctions uh you'll buy crypto cryp coins uh and uh send your ship to Russia and apparently nobody's going to know about there a follow it uh and uh that's that's pretty easy but suppose that Russia buys something from you uh that is sanctioned okay you're going to get a a payment in U in this cryptocurrency how are you going to convert this into American dollars if the markets for the these are in St Petersburg and Moscow then how uh who given the sanctions against dollars and convertibility how are you going to get your dollars out of St Petersburg in Moscow is there going to be some uh uh around process or are there going to be uh other cryp cryptocoin uh markets in in the West in America and Europe maybe in uh in Asia somewhere uh none of this uh really makes sense uh how if you're converting money from crypto Russian crypto uh into Dollars uh there has to be a record of it in your balance sheet uh the corporations have to publish are they going to have uh in their assets and liabilities if they have uh we have this much uh uh money in cryptocurrency uh is our uh Capital Gap backing maybe somebody from the FBI uh will look at it and say wait a minute this cryptocurrency is only used to evade controls with a with a with Russia and to do something illegal can you tell us just about what that transaction is uh maybe we'll come in and could we U take your computers and look over and see what happen here none of this makes sense on the surface and when something doesn't make sense on the surface there's usually a good reason why the designers of this currency uh don't want it to make sense on on the purpose so uh we we can look at the details uh uh of what they own say they say they say it's to facilitate bricks trade uh well again trade channels uh they say the key High highlight is that it's the Gateway for uh the bricks trade but uh again who owns and manages this new currency will it only be government officials that manage it or what I suspect is private individuals have set up this fund uh on a consignment from the government uh acting on their own and the government has to leave the management to these non-government officials I would surpris be surprised if Russia's Central Bank is actually managing it and if it's not managed by the central bank or Russian government Authority then somebody else must benefit are they getting a commission for all of this what's their commission why and if that's the case why doesn't Russia just do it itself what why does Russia need a group of non-governmental uh anti-government admirers of free markets uh to organize something you'd think normally a government would be doing itself uh just to make sure that uh there's no Sam bankman freed in there just taking the money uh for themselves how is the Russian government's interest protected and how are the uh people parties who are supposed to be importing uh and exporting to Russia to handle the translation of their own currency let's say dollars in into and out of the Russian cryptocoins uh without the the government uh anti- sanction police uh coming in and uh uh trying to accuse them of uh uh what whatever they law they want to site in all of this uh it just doesn't make sense it doesn't seem to be a government agency um the they say the target audience is going to be large uh limited initially to large companies uh particularly exporters and importers well that that's very strange and then they say to large companies for savings well why would the Russian government want to create a vehicle for other people ought to save in unless they want the price of the Russian cryptocoin to go up relative to other currencies to be an investment vehicle and if that's the case and the price does go up as apparently the designers want it to be suppose then Russia owes money in cryptocoins for the Imports or the contracts that it makes as foreigners uh it's going to end up Suddenly owing a lot more money uh in cryptocoins than it would have made just in a uh bilateral deal uh what why are these needed uh you can't just say Well they're needed because uh for there's export import trade with Russia okay but how does this solve that need of course uh they're just citing all of the things that people want to happen and then saying this is going to solve it all but they don't say how it's going to uh to solve it all that's what doesn't doesn't make any sense uh I'd like to know what Russian agencies are involved and the fact that no Russian agencies were involved to begin with and the cryptocoin was supposed to be really a a a Bitcoin with a Russian flavor uh sort of like with Russian characteristics uh basically because it traded in in Russia well one of the problems if if it's traded in the Moscow and St Petersburg exchange is is there going to be a published statement here are the cryptocoins uh assets and liabilities uh it it's got all this money from uh dollars and speculators Latin America Asia Africa uh that those that liabilities what are they what are the assets what are they invested in uh are we going to have a balance sheet of their uh gold Holdings and we'd like to know the foreign currency Holdings and if they're uh invested in just what they say uh the coin is uh gold and foreign currencies uh then there's not going to be a capital appreciation but uh I think what they've done is taken the index that the Brits countries have talked about they said if we're going to deal with balance of payments imbalances between the bricks countries and each other and China uh some countries are going to uh owe more money than others they're going to be deficit countries and uh Surplus countries this is the issue that John mayard KES addressed in 1944 to say you know how are we going to uh create a central uh Central Bank currency just to denominate intergovernmental assets and debts uh so that uh there can be some standard of valuation for uh countries that either run a surplus or a balance a payments deficit uh the Russian Bitcoin has nothing to do with that nothing to do with uh government money what the bricks uh need what Russia needs and China needs is uh some uh Central Bank Ledger of uh assets and debts and uh the way like the can's bankor it was called in 1944 well the the Americans didn't want K's bankor because wait a minute we want hard money uh we know that England's in trouble we want to make sure that we end up absorbing England's Empire so uh we're not going to let any Central Bank create this artificial money uh to lend uh England uh the money to get by they're going to have to depend on dollars uh that uh so the Russian plan is really like the US plan uh that was against uh keynes's plan against the plan to say well if America runs a big balance of payment Surplus and continues to do it then after a point we're going to write down the Surplus and we're going to cancel the debts for Deb countries like England because uh we don't want to sacrifice uh debter England uh to have to impose depression like it did in the 1920s for the uh for the inter Al debts uh and uh like Global South countries are having to do today for their debtors uh this is not uh the the aim of what the Bitcoins are created for yeah Richard welcome yes my apologies in all the back and forth I I I didn't remember the 145 I left it at two on my calendar my apologies no problem at all Richard can you address what we were because if you remember we were talking about the cryptocurrency plan on the part of Russia to facilitate the brick the bricks trade and what's your take on this concept well in order not to get lost in the weeds and and there in any case Michael would be a better guide than I am uh for those sorts of things for me I see this as a longterm shift of the world economy the dominance of the US dollar is being eroded in a variety of ways it's less important for trade it's less important for for loans it's less important for Investments um for me that's a complicated process different countries have different agendas actually different Industries also have different agendas and they're not the same as their countries they're all trying to figure out how to adjust basically to the decline of the American Empire and that's going to take a while it always has with every other Empire it's an adjustment process trying to figure out how to emerge from this change in as good or better shape than you went into it and that takes time to figure out and each country's decision now that there's more of a world economy than we've had before each country's decision changes the parameters for every other country so you have one of these Dynamic adjustments in which everything is an adjustment to an adjustment to an adjustment and to foretell how that's going to work it's literally impossible too many variables can't do that so I I think you stay best with the big picture the Russians have for example several conflicting or at least not identical interests they need to fund the war they're in the middle of one they need to support the bricks as a counterweight to the G7 they need to work carefully their relationship with India and China and other parts of the Global South but particularly India and China and they need to enhance the power and importance of a uh of the ruble so all of those things are at stake here and how they maneuver with whom they agree to trade in what currency are they going to be in favor of a single currency a basket of currencies you know this is wrapped up with whether we're going to have another Empire the Chinese or we're going to have a multi-polar system uh that isn't so like what we've had for quite a while in the human race at this point but which we might now be capable of at least trying to do all of those things are being played out here and I don't think we should attack ourselves too much to one or the other they are meaningful this is a meaningful act that the Russians are trying to to do this but so was the decision for example of Saudi Arabia to accept payment for oil in in currencies other than the dollar having been quite strict beforehand on making it be in that was a very important decision that made possible the Ron with Iran that in turn changed other calculations that's what I mean that each adjustment Pro provokes father followup adjustments in ways you cannot prefigure it's a kind of path developed economic Evolution over time I think uh that Richard has said exactly what the problem to be solved is and that problem basically requires a central bank for the bricks countries to make this it it has to be settled by some kind of uh consensus among the various countries that's exactly what the Russian proposal does not do the uh it's ex it's the antithesis of what what this cryptocurrency is because it's crypto uh and the whole idea of a uh what do central banks need is how do we deal with the balances that mount up between Surplus countries and deficit countries and if if China uh spends a lot of money on the built- and Road investment and the recipients of this investment are going to owe money uh to China how how are we going to denominate uh this money and uh this kind of debt and uh what are the terms that it'll be PID that are going to be paid uh we're not going to be like the IMF and insist on austerity plans to pay there has to be an overall uh government sort of like a financial United Nations for all this and instead and the uh uh the uh bricks uh uh the the unit uh coin uh proposal that uh Russia is talking about is the the exact opposite it's just the new uh speculative currency that can be used uh for uh trade with Russia or the Russians and I mean my question is who are these Russians are they the central bank is it a group of Consultants to the Russians is it a a group of Russian uh scammers uh who have convinced the r uh the Russian government to let us handle it uh everything's going to be okay we don't know a thing and when uh somebody makes a proposal for a new company especially for a financial initial public offering uh you you need to know who the people are uh does anybody own these uh uh crypto coins already and have they taking a position in it and if the price goes up are they going to benefit or somehow uh will Russian Central Bank be the beneficiary or else hold a liability if they owe money in these that that's really the issue that I uh all we can do in this show is to try to convince people to raise these questions and uh not let uh uh themselves be Bamboozled by uh people uh promoters who are not uh answering these questions and apparently want to do not want people to know uh who's managing it and who's getting the money and where's the money being invested I want to add one more dimension to this which is an amazing number of people seem to live live including economists seem to live in a world that's ahistorical they don't seem to be aware I noticed that so often they don't seem to be aware that throughout human history debts have often been unmanageable by the borrower who has at a certain point said that's it I'm not paying anymore and then the question is what happened but there's no automatic mechanism here it there isn't somebody you know there there isn't a a powerful God in the sky who makes you pay the question is will there be a political force that makes you pay will there be an economic force that makes you pay but that's always a question that's not always a question whose answer is automatic and if you don't get it right if you don't understand the old truth that had to be learned by the human race you keep squeezing the borrower who hasn't paid back you may eventually produce much greater damage to yourself than you would have had to suffer if you had said no thank you you don't have to pay anymore try to remember for example that after World War I fr France and Germany imposed the reparations on Germany and it meant that Germany suffered an outflow of money having nothing to do with buying and selling its products but it a debt it had to pay it had to pay reparations it's like having borrowed and the French and the British had this idea they wanted to have fought a World War they didn't have to pay for a luxury that very few ever get to really get enjoy they tried what did they do I'm going to make a long and complicated story short but they produced Adolf Hitler it made it impossible for Germany to repay they started repaying in the immediate aftermath of the war 1918 by 1923 the way they were repaying was by printing money on a scale that the world had never seen in a short amount of time you went from half a dozen deuts Mark to the dollar to five billion Deutch Mark to the dollar right that's an inflation prices were doubling for months at a time every few hours in Germany that's how their inflation actually worked and what did it do it went and it decimated the German middle class which had been accumulating savings for a century in The Frugal way the Germans did at that time and those savings accumulated over five generations for a century were worth a quarter pound of butter in the matter of six months they were wiped out what the war didn't destroy the inflation did and what the inflation didn't destroy the depression of 1929 did if you subject a modern population to losing a World War to a mammoth inflation and to a depression punctuated by a total inability to repay its debts you have a prescription for catastrophe and all you need is a Hitler to ride into power on the basis of that catastrophe Hitler takes power in January of 1933 which is literally the culmination of these events and people are very sorry that they didn't forgive the reparations or forget the damn reparations long earlier it might have you'll never know but it might have evolved a different history different in very very important ways and when a Latin American company country I don't know Chile or Argentina big borrowers can't pay you know it's never the banks that can enforce it that's that's the United States and the military who in the end threaten or the financial community that threatens you'll never get another loan from us which by the way isn't a very powerful threat since it's easily counted by by saying right because we don't pay back the old debts any new debts you give us will get priority and so we will continue to get there it's a game but it's a game almost like a place of Russian Roulette and it makes the whole borrowing and debting and imbalances be a provocation but without a clear answer because the clear answer depends on all the other political and economic conditions within which a loan is taken out a repayment program described a a a repayment program uh ignored all of those then become events of their own whose outcome is uncertain I'm trying to relate what Richard says to the question uh Richard how Nema began this was uh to discuss the Russian proposals for this new cryptocurrency uh and the connection with what you've said about German reparations every hyperinflation in history has come from foreign exchange from owing debts in a currency that you do not produce uh the myth of the uh private Enterprise boys is Gee Russia uh printed so much money that it caused the currency decline uh and uh created hyperinflation that's not what happened at all uh Russia was burdened with inter Al debts to pay the Allies so that the Allies could pay their debts to the United States for the U arms that they bought before the United States entered World War I so what Russia did it it sold the its own currency the Deutsch mark on the foreign exchange and uh to try to buy the the uh dollars and the Franks and the British Sterling that had to pay these countries to pay the Americans and as they put the money in the foreign exchange the the foreign exchange plunged and when the because the exchange rate plunged that increased the cost of imports as denominated in German marks and first you had the uh the decline in the exchange then the rise in prices and then finally the money supply was a response uh to all of these steps so uh that's the kind of problem you had in regarding uh what are you going to do if a d won't pay well we all know who the largest is that's not going to pay and that's the United States uh it's not going to pay the foreign holders of uh Central of uh dollars that is the central banks that hold their monetary reserves in dollars uh and uh if you try to collect the United States will uh mount a color revolution in their countries but this really gets off the whole issue of foreign Curren uh there's no way that the uh cryptocoin uh is going to solve any of these problems or that the free market can solve these problems because it can only be solved by uh governments as you say the governments shouldn't have demanded German reparations or the inter Allied debts that caus that made the reparations necessary all of these are decisions that have to be made as you point out the world's breaking into two different areas and whatever uh the bricks countries are going to do that are supposed to be the beneficiaries of this system is going to be something that is negotiated by their governments not set by private corporations buying a currency in uh cryptocurrency uh in a uh uh in Russian currency exchanges so I I want I want to focus on uh just what Nema said and we're discussing you know why why uh what really you pointed out what should be the concern uh of the Russian government to solve the problem and instead of Sol any discussion of solving this problem they've come out with uh the cryptocoin that doesn't have anything to do with the problems that you've just discussed yeah yeah it's a little surprising I don't understand when I read it I didn't understand what the why this is happening now and and if you're going to do something that is supposed to be good for bricks and and in this world thing it can't be done by one country it can't be done in in Russia what is that why are they doing that they're not even the biggest player in bricks not by a long shot if someone's going to start doing this kind of game it would be the Chinese not the Russians and the Chinese didn't do it and are clearly not part of this at least what I've read I don't see them as part of it so I my suspicion is that this is some sort of initiative that to understand it you would need to know much more than I do about internal Russ and maneuvering and the government there and that this will fade that's my guess that this will fade and be replaced by something that's much more Collective and that's much more about settling imbalances among the bricks people well you're saying uh why are they doing this well what my question is who are the they yeah that's but we don't know I have no idea who the the they are I suspect I don't see uh any sign that that it's the Russian Central Bank this announcement is not a central bank Russian Central Bank announcement it's a Announcement by well we really don't know who that's the problem it's it's somebody's announcement uh using uh Russia uh uh Russia's needs uh to solve the uh sanction problem is a cover story to all of a sudden uh find this uh solution this uh cryptocurrency solution that's a solution without a problem and uh we think they should talk about the problem you and I are talking about yes the the intergovernmental problem of how are you going to create this alternative to the Dollar on a a global scale that's not what this is all about this is how to avoid the problem and avoid governments uh altogether it's sort of an anti- uh bricks currency yeah just let me show something here Richard and Michael here we have a an article in ruers reporting that Russian economy show that Russian economy is growing and we've been talking about this before and when you look at you two look at this conflict in Ukraine do you think what's in the mind of Washington right now if they knew that the Russian economy is not going down is getting better well you know let me try to off for an answer one is shortterm and the other is long-term the shortterm answer and really and I i' I've tried to think this through over and over and I don't come up with anything else the shortterm answer is the word propaganda in its literal traditional sense endless effort is made by the people who started this war who connived to generate this War uh to blame Russia for being the bad guy here for causing the war um and to be able to make the argument that the United States's opposition is successful it is saving Ukraine it is saving freedom and it is punishing the bad Russians and the propaganda line is those things are all happening and the fact that none of them are happening has now not been a deterrent for at least a year they just repeat it over and over again and they do this by hyping whatever the you poor ukrainians and let's remember this is a war between the west and Russia uh in which the two sides have agreed to fight to the last Ukrainian okay and I don't mean to be funny because it's awful for what happening uh in that country but that that's really what this is all about it is a pretense by the people who do not want to be responsible for any failure they do not want to say that the Russians are now um have taken over whatever it is a quarter or a third of the land mass of of Ukraine is now under Russian military control so that's a defeat they don't want to admit that Russia isn't doing well that's what this headline from Reuters shows that their economy has grown faster across this war than it was growing before which is not a measure of failure and not a measure of the success of the United States and finally they have to say that these sanctions work there was a recent article I we may have discussed it in an earlier program a recent article either in the financial times or the Wall Street Journal that counted sanctions the United States is number one in the world it now has outstanding 15,000 sanctions against governments Industries individuals number two which may surprise you in the world is Switzerland with a mere 5,000 but the great enemies of the United States don't do sanctions so you either have to assume they're too poor well that's no longer the reason or they're too stupid that's not a reasonable reason or you might conclude it's because they don't work and there's a literature a vast literature that indicates that sanctions don't work and by don't work I mean a they are easily more or less evadable avoidable you get around them in lots of different ways but number two and more important they are politically counterproductive because the damage you do is to the mass of the people whose leaders explain to them that it's because of the sanctions even when it isn't so you allow you're giving your enemy the best possible that's why you have no change in Cuba you've had sanctions against Cuba for 60 odd years or 70 odd years with the attempt to get rid of that regime attempt failed sanctions failed why well in one way Castro and now his successors are able to say to the Cuban people who have suffered materially from these sanctions because their ability to evade being a small island 90 miles off the shore of the United States is much more limited than other other countries in the rest of the world they couldn't evade so well so they've suffered but it didn't shake the regime because everybody in Cuba was told 10 times a day this is because of the S the Americans are doing that to you giving every Cuban a personal stake in being angry and opposed to the United States for the damage that the United States did to the education they could give their children to the lifestyle they could give their family to what they themselves could do I mean it is a it's stupid Beyond words it's really stupid in many of its cases there are some cases where it can work but they are limited and a general policy of doing this is a neoconservative nonsense that they don't want to admit and so you get this endless placing of stories this KK the the defeated Ukrainian Army finds a weak area on the on the battle line and plunges into to Russia an area that is underdeveloped everybody knows doesn't have much in the way of resources is underdeveloped doesn't have many cities is rural and they can take it for a few days maybe a few weeks and now the Russians predictably move their troops since they have a two to one troop advantage over Ukraine they move their troops around they are pushing the ukrainians out of this little but they try tried to Palm that little game of desperation off as Mr zolinski announced he's now ready to sit down and bargain with Putin as if his incursion into K changes anything but the American Media are full of celebrations of the advances made by the Ukrainian military one one really has the feeling one's in another world here and in the long run I think what you're seeing is the Discovery by the bricks Nations by Russia China and India above all but the others too that the United States doesn't have the power it once did that the name of the game and I'm going out on a limb here but I want I don't want us to shy away from it that the name of the game here is for the United States either you're willing to use nuclear weapons in which everything changes or you're not but if you're not the rest of all of your maneuver is Bluff and we're not we're not fooled we know and you're not gonna you're not going to threaten us with nuclear war and get us there for to back off we are exposing that that's the only card you have and everything else we can take it and we can win this and believe me this is as powerful a change of the world as if they had actually as if somebody had dropped a nuclear weapon well I think you and I have discussed earlier on this show uh that sanctions don't work and I think now uh the US realizes that and certainly they're not going to do sanctions uh beyond what they've done already on China uh and I think Nemo was talking earlier about uh how the sanctions that have been uh imposed recently by the US and Canada and the other allies are mainly against uh China and the question is how how are countries like China going to respond to these sanctions is that something are we going to get get to discussing that Nina yeah yeah go ahead well you you mentioned before uh I think when you were writing us that the comments on the bill rally show saying that the US should concentrate on the war of Ukraine uh and the US priority is going to be China uh Richard was just talking about the blond mention that JD Vin the Trump's pick for the vice president JD Vin was talking about this on B on bow rilly show yeah and uh uh the what the United can states can do against China is very much different uh than uh Russia but the the B uh one of the uh casualties of all this is European relations so basically the US is uh telling uh America's allies uh well we're not going to fight against uh Ukraine because we're going to fight against our main enemy that's China uh and so uh you you're going to have to uh pay uh for your own War to support Ukraine and uh given the eu's budget deficits of just 3% of GDP how is Europe going to uh really uh fight to support uh Ukraine uh in this while America essentially pulls back it's I think it's given up on Ukraine uh we're not going to have uh probably uh nonatomic War there the US says okay we're going to treat Ukraine like we walked out of Afghanistan well perhaps Mr blinkin will suggest uh uh to Europe that there is a way uh to finance uh uh Ukraine uh it can simply grab China's foreign exchange reserves in Europe just like it grabbed Russia's reserves and maybe it can grab the Holdings of Chinese companies there just as the US uh the EU grabbed Russia's resources and uh we know now that uh one of the casualties of the Ukraine War uh has been that Germany is being plunged into depression the financial times just today said that V uh business sentiment is and consumer sentiment has turned down again uh they're going to vote the uh uh in the elections next month in SE September they're probably going to vote out of power altoe uh the Christian democrats and uh the greens uh when in the East German elections that are coming up uh but none none of this uh sacrifice of Europe has deterred the US bureaucracy and the current political leaders from putting their loyalty to the United States first uh and if uh European voters are not able to prevent them from giving uh us diplom a priority over their own National needs uh then uh the United States is going to be free to extend its conflict in China with uh leaving uh Europe holding the bag and uh there it can even uh now uh impose sanctions under uh against Europe trading in China just as it stopped its trade and investment although it seems that the US is now turning uh much more to uh uh to tariffs yeah well I don't know maybe I disagree just a bit with Michael which is unusual but let me pursue it maybe not I was struck that Jake Sullivan the security advisor is in China I believe now as we speak I thought it was oh you're right it's it's Sullivan yeah you're right yeah Sullivan um and I was also struck that apparently there was some sort of telephone call yesterday between Biden and ji jingping that was associated with uh Jake Sullivan going over there the ostensible conversation according to Sullivan's people was that he was going to persuade China not to support Russia in Ukraine uh that that's so ridiculous that I'm not going to wait you I'm not interested in that nobody in the world is interested in that they've tried that for years and that is Dead on Arrival if anything ever was unless it's just a cover for some sort of proposal or deal that they uh that they want to make and the reason I think it might be just my I don't know anything that nobody else doesn't know I think that you you're going to see I think there's a good chance you're going to see some Stark reversals in po positioning and policy because what has been going on is such a rolicking failure I mean it's a failure upon a failure upon a look what we just said about Russia and Ukraine that's a failure it's a failure it's a fa you know and China China has been the butt of tariff war and tradee War at least from Obama certainly through Trump continued by Biden and it was always supposed to change Chinese Behavior I don't see anything that it it's a failure it doesn't work and even the practitioners in the west watching this who are not charged with public relations must on some level so here comes my guess you're going to see reversal because underneath the phony unanimity around this last gasp of Western domination Ukraine there's been building a domestic hostility to all of this bitterness anger which is now about at a Tipping Point I'm going to give you examples the British election wipes out the conservative party that's sort of interesting those people didn't vote labor labor won because it held on to its vote and the conservatives left by the millions if you just look at the last two elections that's a disgust with all of it with the with the corruption of that clown uh who was the the mayor of London I forget his name who doesn't comb his hair that that idiot um you know the end of that Johnson what Boris Johnson that's right uh the disaster that brexit has been for Britain the fact that the working class there their real income has plunged more than that of almost anyone else in Europe for a while now I mean it's a it's a walking disaster way ing for finally people to say this is impossible then we have Germany look at what look at what Michael just said a few moments ago this is an economy which was the engine of Europe and now it is the dead Corps of Europe it is not driving European the economy it's dragging a lackluster European economy even further down Olaf Schultz is the proprietor of this absurdity and they're going to vote him out they're going to vote him out and it's going to be led by lots and lots of German capitalists who don't want this who want once again to be the V vunda because they got cheap oil and gas from Russia they want that back they really make Germany great again you know in France you've already seen it they turned around and said to Mr maon you're dead in the first round of the French elections his party came in third 20% 80% of the French electorate voted against Emmanuel macron despite his working so hard to be a attractive young man which he you know all pissed away is gone and I think my own judgment they're going to shift gear they're going to we're going to see some big changes look at it the French left is now the unified largest force in the French assembly Jean Luke melona name nobody in America knows just introduced articles of impeachment against maon and they may work probably not but they might you know I think you're watching let let me put the icing on the cake absolutely kamla Harris is the vice president under Biden she is part of the democratic party she always has been and so on what I'm about to say is not about her she has rescued the Democratic Party from what I thought was a stone cold loser under Mr Biden but the only interesting question really about her is not her will there be a ground swell from below that she might be willing to work with in a way that a Biden couldn't and a trump you know not silly it might be the level of militancy rising in the United States is not to be toyed with the number of strikes the number of impetuses to slow down the corporate game I'm noticing that the attempt of the the two largest grocery chains in America Kroger and Albertson's to combine Kroger has offered to buy Albertson which would make them the third largest retailer after Amazon and Walmart in the United States saving them from losing their grocery business to uh Amazon and Walmart which they have already half done they're desperately trying to hold but these maneuvers of super large corporations are are costing a fortune and are driving up prices of food and that is mobilizing the population in a bitter hostility to all of this you you're seeing tensions Each of which has a particular cause I get that and Each of which may play itself out without shaking the larger totality that's also possible but it is also possible in a way I did not see in Years Gone by that these particulars have the power to shake the whole totality and if I were a European my worst worry my nightmare would be a deal between Russia excuse me between China and the United States to overcome their differences to compensate themselves for what they have to give up by carving up Europe between them well I think that I agree completely with uh the diagnosis of uh uh what Richard has said and what should be done the question is whether it will be done uh and there's another interpretation of what may be happening uh Nemo was mentioning earlier for instance that uh Canada is going to impose a 25% Duty on Chinese uh steel and uh uh aluminum exports just as uh Donald Trump is proposing a 20% uh import Duty on all of China's Imports uh let's suppose for a minute that what Mr Sullivan is uh discussing in China is instead of saying we admit that the game's over we admit we made a mistake I uh what if Sullivan says we never make a mistake because we're the indispensable Nation we can do whatever we want so I think you know we're just letting you know uh we're going to help decouple from you because that's what we want to do we're going to uh do to you what we tried to do to Russia and isolate you not by sanctions we know they're not working directly but we're going to impose tariffs on you uh that uh and uh what do you think of that well here's what I think uh if they try that uh I I think China may say something like the following uh to Canada and they can certainly say this uh to Mr Sullivan they could say well something very interesting here if you put a 20% tariff on Chinese uh uh exports to the United States that means that you're making money from our exports and the more we export to you the more ter the more uh money the US government raises for itself in the form of tariffs and the more uh the uh they import from you the more the government has this money uh in its budget to now spend on more military uh bases all surrounding you and more money to finance the uh uh color revolutions around you so in effect uh American tariffs are mean to say let uh Chinese trade with America finance America's own military spending uh surrounding uh China well what can China do for this it has a number of logical ways to respond uh suppose that it would impose a a 40% 50% exports their charge on sales to the United States uh or to for us allies who want to Simply uh reroot uh the exports to the United States or they could cut the gordian n and simply say okay uh Mr Sullivan you know we realize you know you say that you're our enemy you want to decouple our uh economies and you want to hurt us by not by closing off our export markets like you closed off Russia's markets okay well we really want to be peaceful with you so we're going to help you uh we're we're we ourselves uh are going to voluntarily uh cut back our exports uh to you uh you don't have to impose uh the tariffs we know that's going to be very hard to get through uh uh Congress because only Congress uh can Levy that the tariffs uh and we also want to balance the trade we know that we export more to Europe and to you than you export to us over we overproduce and that's why we have to export so uh let we're going to go along with a picture that you're drawing and uh I think China we're just going to uh cut back our exports now we've already begun last week we cut back we limited our exports of gallium and germanium I'm not going to export them anymore you know we're going to use them ourselves uh we we know that you need these for your military uh we know that you need Rare Earth compounds and computer technology and other items we know that you need rare Earths and gallium and germanium for your computer things but uh let's let's uh decouple well just imagine what's that uh that's uh China can play can go along with the US sanctions sort of like Muhammad Ali the rid do yeah go along to you and uh we'll just uh uh turn them turn them around uh and uh leave you you go your way we'll go our way uh give everything away I mean I personally would have rather what I would have liked to see in so have and visiting China is China would have simply uh arrested him and turned him over to the international Court as a war criminal but the international court hasn't has hasn't officially issued any arrest warrants yet so all it can do is uh in instead of meeting him at the airport they had to meet with low ranking officials and uh I I I think uh they're uh they'll just uh go along with the US it's like a judo go along with the US motion let it play itself out I don't think the US is anywhere near the nice uh uh position that you real reality based uh position that you're uh hoping that uh the world will see as an alternative to Atomic War uh but I I don't think that either Sullivan or blinkin are realistic enough uh to think that as you say uh that game is over the United States can't do what it used to anymore all it can do is make threats and uh uh the strong point of Russia and China is uh to to go along with them and just like uh the ending the Russian trade with Europe uh broke uh Europe's industrial uh production that was based on low priced Russian gas so uh the US economy is based on low priced raw materials uh and electronics sophisticated uh exports from China and if uh they try at all to raise uh import taxes on China is a means of financing America's War budget with these proceeds uh China can do uh to to America what uh uh what's happened to uh Germany and Europe as a result of America's actions towards Europe that's that's what happens if uh the Americans are too dumb to agree with what Richard says yeah you know as I listen to Michael I realize there's even more evidence for what he is saying because in in many ways think about China with me for a minute in the following way 40 years ago China was one of the poorest countries on this planet and over the last 40 years whether it's 45 it you know it doesn't matter they have experienced unspeakable economic growth I just fantastic okay they therefore probably think as we all would not only that the efforts of the American government to come over there and suggest they should go some other way are silly because they've proven that their way is the fastest way to get out of poverty and to become a powerful country look what they've done so nobody would be in a worse reason to listen to such aice but they might also be understood to have a view very deep in their Consciousness now that time is on their side it's the very nightmare of the American Military it's too dangerous to fight a war now but the prospects of it being any better next year or five or 10 or 15 years from now or even worse they might be tempted to do stuff now because they can see the same trajectories that I'm outlining here and the irony may be that the Chinese leadership understands exactly what Michael said with this addition they've got to help the United States avoid walking itself into the kind of dead end that might make nuclear weapons a reasonable option for them they've got to absorb look they've been working for at least the last 10 years to boost domestic consumption so they're less reliant on exports they've said so we've seen it it's visible they've reduced their dependence on American the debt of the United States they had $1.2 trillion dollar they now have seven or 800 billion in US denominated assets so clearly they are doing because those are conscious act they are doing things and they're gonna wait us out they're gonna AB it's clear by from a number of studies I've looked at that a number of the tariffs fail because the Chinese lowered the price so that what happened is they accepted W so that we are having Richard we are having some sort of in what you're talking about it seems that one of the system is just yeah I one of the mics from you or Michael is just getting back the sound is getting back to me from one of your systems can I talk no I see yeah I don't know what that I have I've been using this all day it hasn't happened Michael can you talk to check it out yeah what do you want me to to say I mean I think Richard should be Secretary of State and everything would be much better uh but the question is I think that these guys are locked in uh to their it's it's called hubis uh and uh that's happened to a lot of EMP Empires before and My worry is that when the United States say we're going down year after year and brixie going up just like Richard says that leads the newon to say well uh we'd better bomb them now because if we wait till next year they'll be even stronger to defend themselves and the year after they'll be stronger so if we're going to have the end of the world let's have it now on our terms by the way I have to leave in five minutes so uh you if I may have to turn it off I have a covid shot scheduled racher go ahead Michael can you turn off your mic just turn up the mic ye yes oh yes I'll turn it off when I stop talking okay turn it off I promise to turn it off when I stop talking I I have about five minutes left as well listen to what Richard says Richard go ahead yeah I I I think that we may be at that point where the Chinese are realizing that one of the things that goes with Empire is you really do have to now take a kind of responsibility for everything because your Empire depends on everything it's the other it's the hegelian other side you're the big powerful but that brings with it levels of responsibility you did not think you had to shoulder they've had a very good ride being the exporter to the world and now they're going to have to absorb some of the difficulty with but yes we are having some technical problem I don't know what you're muted let me turn it on I think the issue is with your mic Richard mik Richards Richards yeah something happening let me say conect go to the store and I'm talking without Richard before now he can go without me and I'll see you next time can you understand me now yeah it's much better I think yeah I think it was the other Michaels yeah Machinery my point is my point is in the time that we have left that China is now so big and growing so fast it has now conquered almost everything you might want to list um for a poor country it is now a Middle inome Country it has lifted 800 million people out of poverty according to the UN it can compete with the United States at the highest levels of technical sophistication and in now already in several areas uh is ahead of the United States it has shown that it can undertake a 10 or 15E crash program in research and development such as the electric car and come out at the end having done a better job of producing a quality at a price than anybody else could do which is why there are tariffs against them in the United States and Europe uh that they are now at a point of understanding some of the costs that are raced to the top wouldn't think about until it got to the top and then it had to face it and so when the United States threatens by closing itself off Fe tariffs so the Chinese cannot unload their exports in the United States the way they were doing for 20 years they have to make adjustments and if they hit the United States with an equivalent that will hurt them possibly more than the United States and if it doesn't if it hurts the United States that might be more dangerous for China they have to face these realities which they did not have to face before it's the problem you know in economics if you're a competitive Enterprise and you have lots of other competitors what you do doesn't affect the market very much but if there's concentration if many competitors have become a few and many have have died along the way and been absorbed by the winners and you're now an oligopoly or a monopoly you have to take into account the whole Market in a way you never had to when you were an aspiring small competitive company it's the irony that what you hoped for when you got it turned out to have a lot of problems you hadn't noticed when you were hoping for it that's a very you know hegelian understanding of the contradiction and China is becoming the global power that it is and that's going to mean some costs and it's going to weigh those costs in a way it did not have to before and my guess is they got to know it it's something you you learn pretty quick the United States learned it at a certain point so did the Europeans so did the British in their empire and my guess is again that we may be ready we may be in for a big surprise the election outcome in Germany next month the election outcome in the United States in November these are are very big moments that may involve big shifts in which what was thought to be a minor point of view becomes very dominant very quickly people should understand I go back last thing to my first example the British election which is uninteresting in most ways but in one way it's remarkable the absolute dominance of the conservatives who blew away one labor party leader after or Another Not Just Jeremy Corbin but suddenly not only did they win the election but they have overwhelming dominance in the parliament the conservative party is simply Blown Away by a sudden but if you look at it it's not so sudden the vote was sudden but this had been building up until the the the control of the conservatives was destroyed by the conservatives they could not hold it together they had developed ways of Behaving that were literally destroying them and they couldn't stop they could not stop Richard just to wrap up this session when you look at what JD Vince said he's he was talking about Europe focusing on the war in Ukraine while the United States is going to confront China do you think that your the European Union is willing to do that because at the end of the day without the United States putting pressure on the European Union how they can continue with this conflict it's pure bravado at this point they cannot pursue that war alone they never could they they look they really only went into that war because the United States pushed them and committed to pay for it and committed to provide the weapons uh yes the Europeans were asked to help and they have helped absolutely but this is an American project from beginning to end as was the whole expansion of NATO uh from its original boundaries to the east no I don't think the Europeans can do it but I would also tell you that Mr Vance you know this is a man who wants to disqualify ify people from holding political office because they did not give birth to children I mean for that to become a major idea tells you that they have no solutions to any they have to make up arguments because there is nothing for them and Mr Vance is trying to the degree that this is serious at all is trying to figure out how do we handle that Mr Trump wants to forget the the Ukraine war and that's not going to work with our allies well we're going to have a division of a division of labor is a much more publicity smart way of presenting this than ending the war Trump just wants to end the war this this this looks to to his advisers as very stupid Mr Vance allows you to be fighting Russia without fighting Russia so that's his plan yeah not serious I'm telling you not it may they may go that way but it's not serious yeah thank you so much Richard for being with us today great pleasure as always same with me and my apologies again for doing late I I won't do that again problem all see you soon
