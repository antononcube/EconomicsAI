hi everybody today is Thursday April 10th 2025 and our friends Richard Wolf and Michael Hodson back with us welcome back glad to be here when when it comes to the conflict right now the economic conflict between the United States and China many people are asking what is the main strategy on the part of the Biden administration and here is the way that the secretary the the Treasury Secretary of the United States Scott Bessent is talking about it fortunate that the Chinese actually don't want to come and negotiate because they are the worst defenders in the international trading system they have the most imbalanced economy in the history of the modern world and you know I can tell you that this escalation is a loser for them that they they have some very smart the economist the academicians technocrats within their bureaucracy and they would be telling the leadership that we do not have the edge here they are the surplus country that Yeah what's your take Michael let's start with you what's your take on the way that the Trump administration is trying to talk about the strategy on their part even we've heard that CNN was reporting with talking with GOP Senator Ron Johnson he said he has no idea what is the the strategy what's your take on that Mike well when Bessant said that China had an unbalanced economy what it meant was that it was successful and him for his idea a balanced economy is one without any government uh and ideally for Trump without any income tax uh so uh but that's not how China looks at it china believes it's a mixed public private economy uh with the government playing uh the same kind of active role that it played in the United States industrial takeoff in the 19th century and that it played in Germany's takeoff and earlier in British mercantalism the uh China knows that it already is the central uh provider and refiner of many raw materials that the uh the west needs uh and that if it's if indeed it says we're not going to be bullied which is what its foreign minister has said uh we're not going to negotiate when somebody says we're going to hurt you if you don't want what we say we're we're going to raise tariffs and prevent you from trade china's gone rope a dope it says "Okay we we're on with that we're we stop uh you want to balance the trade more with this well we're stopping uh our exports to you of critical materials uh we're we're stopped we have a whole list of uh products that we're not going to uh send to you these are the products that your industry needs without importing from China american industry after a few months of depleting its reserves of uh parts uh pharmaceuticals uh various chemicals uh raw materials the American economy will have to stop producing and uh China has said "Well we're now going to need licenses to get uh the critical materials uh that we produce." And uh the uh China has the ability to stop to just uh interrupt America's production relations and assembly lines uh and just stop things so it says fine uh but I I talk often with uh uh Chinese policy makers and uh their their view is not that they will lose from the United States but they think the United States is committing economic suicide and mostly they think that America is going to end up the loser in this tariff war because uh it doesn't have an industrial policy simply imposing tariffs isn't industrial policy it merely makes it more expensive for companies to import from their affiliates uh automobile parts from Canada and Mexico as we've discussed in past programs uh but al uh telephones and iPhones uh made by Amazon that are made there shoes uh from uh Vietnam that are imported by the big uh uh shoe shoe company uh screws all all sorts of things and u China think sees above all that you know why is America not recognizing why China has been so successful in developing what Americans call unbalanced and that is because China has kept uh public infrastructure in the public domain it hasn't let it be been privatized and the most important uh public uh utility that it's kept that uh neither America nor other western countries have kept in the public domain is money china doesn't have a domestic financial class that makes money by speculating and buying out uh other companies uh buying out industry and de-industrializing or deciding let's uh find a cheaper way of doing this to lower uh the wage costs and make more profits the whole aim of China is what used to be the aim of the United States and Germany and other countries you raise wages in order to increase productivity and you provide basic infrastructure to uh provide basic needs electricity communications you know railroads uh at cost or at a subsidized rate so that the industrial companies don't have to pay their uh labor high enough wages to afford this uh services that monopolized in the United States so uh China has made finance part of the industrial growth pattern and uh Trump uh and the United States is not and Trump doesn't realize why the China is developing but America isn't he simply says they're developing and we're not they're ahead of us and that makes them the rival we have to stop them he doesn't say why don't we're doing what China's doing why don't we follow their model that's made them so successful and the irony is that this model that has made China so successful is exactly the same model that the United States followed in the 19th century uh to develop its industrial takeoff it's a model that Germany followed in the 19th century to follow its takeoff there's a certain logic of how do you industrialize and you industrialize with a mixed economy and you take uh the banking system and you use it to finance industrial development not to create monopolies and uh create trusts and essentially try to make money at the expense of industry and the rest of the economy there's no recognition of an industrial policy to back up industrial tariffs so the result is that uh Trump thinks that he'll win the war with China and the Chinese say "Well we're looking at uh who's trading what and who needs what uh if he wants to do that let's uh uh let him go right ahead and and uh do what he's doing and we'll see where the American economy stands in three months richard well you know just to piggyback off what Michael said it's embarrassing i I I listened to that clip of our Treasury Secretary and it's embarrassing what comes out of that man's mouth i mean I I'm beyond words almost in But but let me try why is it calling what the Chinese do somehow self-evident they're technically smart people he said that uh are aware that they shouldn't be doing this what they're doing uh let me remind everyone 70 years ago China was among the poorest countries on this planet it was a an exemplar of the depth of poverty it was the place that Pearl Buck described in her book The Good Earth as almost beyond human suffering the level of difficulty for their people and over the last 75 years and particularly over the last 30 or 35 years they have become one of the economic powerhouses of the modern world why in the world would you want to call that not what it is what Michael says success of course it's success they've become the manufacturing center of the world in that period of time they are the I mean it it blows my mind i recently saw a map of bullet trains in China their the the complex network of their super fast chain chains the the only thing in the United States that comes close is the Asella the the train line that runs from Boston to Washington which is only slightly faster than the convention we basically have no bullet trains and they've connected every place in China with bullet trains by the way Michael reminds us what was the big breakthrough of the 19th century the trains which unified the country which opened up the Midwest to the rest of the world so it could become the the food producer the grain producer transforming everybody else the Chinese are the success story of our time you know earlier government administrations in the United States wanted to make the Chinese uh change their regime change their system we justified bringing them into the World Trade Organization because that was going to make them like us but there's no reason for them to be like us they don't want to be have slow economic growth in 2024 according to the IMF US economic growth about 2.8% Chinese economic growth about 5% and now I know there'll be the conventional nonsense about how you can't trust Chinese numbers i have heard that story uninterrupted for 30 years now it's beginning to fade away since obviously it was nonsense all along and it's nonsense now and by the way those are IMF numbers not numbers from China so the the crucial reality here is that it's the American government that's in trouble it's the American empire that's declining and it's the American capitalist system that has dug itself into a hole if for the last 40 50 years you have run a trade imbalance which we basically have since the 1970s and you've paid for it by a massive export of dollars that come back as debt you're deepening a level of debt that will one day lead people to hesitate to absorb more debt that's what happened on Monday of this week that's why the the bond market freaked them all out look it it it destroyed a British government two or three prime ministers ago when she the woman Liz Truss when she tried to push beyond the level of debt that people will give London crippling that economy still further they're in trouble here and the imposition of tariffs i mean let me take another way of getting it the president of the United States declared economic war on the whole rest of the world by a tariff on every country with a handful of exceptions nobody has ever done that before what is this this is not a sign of a calm collected this is desperation economics and if you doubted it the on again off again just shows you how desperate they are two days of something Monday it has to be reversed because the bond market goes crazy and then Wednesday it has to be reversed because our allies are going to hurt us back the Chinese showing it even the Europeans courageless as they so often nowadays are are are thinking maybe to find some resource but this is not the United States of the 20th century this is the United States going down and flailing around with these gestural policies on again off again wow this is and the whole world one last point the whole world is been given a gift my old teacher Gayorg Wilhelm Friedri would have told me to expect this mr trump attacks the world for cheating and hopes it will get him by doing what he's doing what he has given is a gift to every other leader of every other country who will now be able to point to the economic problems of his or her country and blame Mr trump he has taught them and there'll be a grain of truth to it because the tariffs make a difference hurt people in his country and they're going to yell in every country and their leaders are going to have to blame someone and Mr trump has shown them how to do that blame him and there'll be more truth to their doing that than there was to Mr trump who initiated it as Mr hegel would have said his plan was to burden the rest of the world and make them pay for the problems he has his result they will blame him the opposite is buried right in what he did and he doesn't seem to understand any of that and he keeps doing it 90 days were to wait in other words the uncertainty of the last few weeks will now be for the next three months what may June July nobody knows how to make an investment where to make it you won't know what the supply chains are because you don't know where the tariffs will or will not be or for how long they'll be or for what height how do you make a decision you don't you wait and as Mr kanes told us "When the employer class waits we all discover how capitalism makes the mass of us hostage to what the few of us do with their profits if they don't roll them over and spend them we're screwed." And suddenly what are we looking at stagnation from the holding back from the uncertainty coupled with inflation from the tariffs and we get that stagflation horror that comes back to haunt us this is chaotic economic policy born of desperation whose likely outcome is going to be lot of trouble i don't think it's born of desperation at all trump is not desperate uh he uh is quite confident that he has a solution uh to the problem uh and I think if we take a step back we realize that the uh this whole tariff issue isn't really about uh tariffs at all uh Trump and the Republicans have one political aim above all others and that's what behi is behind what he's doing they want to cut taxes above all for the progressive taxation that falls mainly on the highest incomes uh and on personal wealth uh and it seems that at some point uh Trump must have asked some economists whether there was any alternative way for governments to finance themselves he said "How do we cut taxes what can we do?" And somebody must have told him that uh actually from the time of American independence in 1776 all the way through the eve of World War I by far the dominant form of government revenue was customs revenue from tariffs so you can see that a light bulb uh went off in Trump's brain tariffs don't fall on his own rontier class of real estate financial and monopoly billionaires tariffs fall primarily on labor also on industry for imports of necessary raw materials and parts but the whole idea of uh introducing tariffs is he said the more tariff revenues we can raise the more income taxes we can cut and right now before Congress uh uh uh the Republicans uh are and uh Trump are saying it's time to renew all of the uh vast tax cuts that Trump enacted in his first administration that is what pushed the US u budget into deficit to begin with trump want Trump uh claims that tariffs can uh enable the United States to keep his tax cuts and uh replace uh the taxes and he wants to cut taxes even more on the wealthiest classes uh is if somehow this is going to uh create an incentive for the wealthiest co classes the financial classes the monopolists the real estate people to uh rebuild American industry it's as if giving more wealth to the financial managers they're the ones who've de-industrialized the American economy uh giving them more money will simply repeat the industrial takeoff that was peaking in the 1890s under the president that Trump idealizes uh William McKenley well what his narrative leaves out of account is that tariffs were merely the precondition for nurturing industry by the government in a mixed public private economy just like China has a a mixed uh public private economy the government shaped markets in ways that were designed to minimize the cost of living and doing business and that public nurturing is what gave uh the United States uh its competitive international advantage uh in industry but given Trump's guiding economic aim to untax himself and his most influential uh political constituency what appeals to him is simply the fact that government didn't have an income tax it was able to finance itself through tariffs he why can't it do it uh uh today uh and it's as if all that uh enabled America's remarkable industrial takeoff to occur was cutting tariffs and uh uh also what appeals to Trump is the super affluence of a robber baron class in whose rank you can imagine he thinks of himself as joining the ranks of uh the robber barons and this self-indulgent class consciousness has a blind spot regarding how its own drives and predatory uh income and wealth destroy the economy uh around it uh it's as if the Robert Baronss made money by organizing and driving industry he Trump is unaware that the guilded age of the 1890s did not emerge as part of America's industrial strategy for success or that the great fortunes were made uh possible by the failure to regulate monopolies and the failure to uh tax rier income if you read a book uh Gustavas Meyers history of the great American fortunes told the story of how railroad and real estate monopolists were carved out at the expense of the economy at large and uh the the Democrats and Republicans alike in the 1990s said we've got to prevent this uh these Robert Bearing class so they passed the Sherman antitrust law in 1890 uh then came Teddy Roosevelt the trustbuster uh stopping them and then came the finally an introduction of the American income tax in 1913 and what was so unique about this tax is that it only fell on 2% of the Americans uh you only the very rich had to file a tax return and who were the very rich they were the monopolists uh they were the real estate uh magnets and most of all they were the the bankers uh and the financeers who were uh trying to turn the economy into a trust economy and who were trying to fight against government regulation against uh government uh policy to uh shape an industrial economy and uh so what admire what Trump admires in the 1890s and the late 19th century is everything that ended this whole uh centurylong development of an industrial philosophy and policy to enrich America so uh he's in he's admiring uh the dismantling of uh uh the dynamic of monopolization of financialization of uh uh anti-government legislation that is the opposite of what made America rich that's what makes all of this so ironic richard just Richard here is what Donald Trump said about the why has he decided to to pause tariffs on some countries and we know that China is not one of them like because you said that these tariffs would go in effect on Monday you said no pause and today there is a pause so um how can people believe yeah it's not a question of that you have to have flexibility uh I could say "Here's a wall and I'm going to go through that wall i'm going to go through it no matter what and keep going." And you can't go through the wall sometimes you have to be able to go under the wall around the wall or over the wall these guys know that better than anybody right you got to go around them sometimes you're not going to go through them so I I consider you know I I think in financial markets because they change look how much it changed today we went from uh you know pretty moderate today but over the last few days it looked pretty glum to I guess they say it was the biggest day in financial history that's a pretty big change and I I think the word would be flexible you have to be flexible like he's Richard how how do you characterize the US donor class as Michael was talking about and it its influence on policy well they seem to me to live in a fantasy world that they can do things that clearly they can't do anymore for me the the overwhelmingly interesting thing is as I keep saying that they live in a world in which the United States's economic political ideological cultural and military position are weakening that's why the military strategists keep saying time is on China's side not ours in this conflict but he doesn't want to face any of that he's going to do this that and the other thing no he isn't it isn't going to work for him uh a declining empire does not have the options that a rising empire does the last time we tried that with the tariffs was in a time of the rising US empire that's gone that's over we didn't have a major competitor of the on the scale that the Chinese are today back then and by the way Mr mckinley got the tariff through when he was a representative by the time he became a president he turned against the policy of of tariffs because he got into too much difficulty from the very class that Michael is talking about he Michael is right there's no question that deep below all of the rest of this BS is a desire to avoid what for him is a catastrophe which is the expiration of the tax cut that was passed in 2017 if that is allowed to expire and that legislation has a selfending uh I believe on the 31st of December of this year so if he doesn't get that problem solved his donor class will get an enormous tax increase comparable to the one day decrease that they got eight years ago so he has to deal with that and Michael is also right he's promised more tax cuts on top of making sure that that other tax cut doesn't expire and given that we're already projected to have almost a $2 trillion deficit now he's he is looking at unbelievable risks of a bond market breakdown because people won't lend to the United States anymore because it's too dangerous to do it is what happened to Liz Truss in England not so long ago she tried to come up with a budget that looked like oh we will borrow more no said the bond market we're not going to lend you anymore and and her proposal disappeared and she disappeared she's gone out of political politics in out of politics in Britain i I don't make predictions but Mr trump who has had in the long historical sweep of things a meteoric rise to the top could very well now be on the cusp of an equally meteoric rise down into oblivion because this doesn't work there is an element here that people should understand to the degree that people and businesses around the world lower their prices in order to hold on to the American market despite the tariffs then Mr trump will have achieved at least a part of what he's after he will have made the rest of the world pay a tribute to the United States because that's what it is you want to do business here you pay us and the way you pay us is you lower the price of your exports here that way the American people can keep buying them the price will not go up and the revenues from the tariffs will be paid to the American government and it will be at the expense of the foreigners they don't want it they will be looking to every way to evade it they will be likely to be successful so the end result is that Mr trump will get a small portion of the fantasy he thinks is waiting there for him that's for me what's going on and again that only get it if the rest of the world pays tribute and that is going to make every other leader receive the rage and the bitterness of all those other countries who are being required to pay that tribute and that's a wellspring of hostility that makes the United States not China the world's rogue nation in everybody's mind us allies and enemies alike this is an extraordinarily risky ploy to undertake no Michael we had we had some analysis in in in the mainstream media that it says that if iPhone for example iPhone is produced in the United States it would triple the price of iPhone to 3500 and how how might Trump's tariff policies affect American labor and consumers well he could do that by rolling back history for uh uhundred 100 years or so there's uh there's a reason that the United States uh is so expensive and we've discussed that in the last few shows that the economy's been financialized that uh if a product is made in the United States you have to employ American labor and and you have to pay at a living wage and as we've discussed before American labor has to pay enormous housing costs that are higher than uh those of any other country uh that has to pay uh rising consumer prices uh largely for uh products that have been monopolized uh as the American economy has been there's been a tax shift off the financial sector off real estate and off monopolies off rontier income onto labor uh all of that has to be uh done here the uh the whole American uh neoliberal plan since the 1980s uh thatcherism regonomics and neoliberalism has been to make money for the wealthiest 10% and above all the 1% at the expense of the American economy so you've seen uh as we've said before since 2008 the uh 50% of Americans uh have uh have a teeny share of wealth that has not increased at all all of the increase in wealth since uh 2008 really almost most almost most since uh the 1980s has acred to the 10% this wealth has added to the cost of production for the 90 uh% for the employers and so uh if you look at uh look at how wonderful the stock market has been doing uh see American economy is successful well it's uh uh the stock market because it's owned basically by the 10% that's not the economy the real economy is the employment of labor to produce uh goods and services and that's become offshored and uh essentially financialized uh in a way that's increased the cost of doing business so uh what Trump would have to do would be to have an industrial plan and say my my economic class my donor class has done it all wrong for the last 50 years we've got to get rid of the donor class we've got to restore progressive taxation and tax away all of their predatory income we've got to tax away the real estate rent uh by a land tax we've got to tax away uh monopoly rent by uh take restoring monopolies as public uh utilities in the public domain so that they can provide their services at a cost or a subsidized rate instead of at the monopoly rates we've got to have uh public health insurance so that people don't have to spend 18% of GDP on uh health insurance costs and if employers don't have to contribute to their employee health insurance plan they can lower the cost of production so that it's not going to cost so much to produce uh the uh the government can say we can go back to the original democratic plan of public education everyone has a right to a college education at public expense paid for by the Rontier class uh instead of having student debt uh that uh is so high that employers have when they hire people have to pay the employees enough to pay all the debt that they've taken on in order to get the job uh in the first place all all of these uh these factors are what has uh made America a failed economy and a failed state and in contrast to China which has done exactly what the United States and other countries did to industrialize there's a logic to industrialize you want to increase labor productivity by increasing the educational status of labor increasing its housing uh lowering uh the cost that it has to pay for basic uh utilities uh and uh that's how China has made a lowcost economy that's why Asian uh labor doesn't have to pay the uh wages that American employers have to pay because they don't have to they don't have to pay the medical cost the housing costs the monopoly prices uh that America has to pay uh and the likelihood is that America's trade deficit is going to get uh over overtime uh much worse and will achieve exactly the opposite of what Trump is uh is uh says is going to do trump says that as a result of these tariffs other countries are going to want to move to the United States to produce here to cut the costs well there's no way that they can do that uh because he's sorting uh uh sort of dem democles over the heads of foreign investors uh if they u are successful somehow they're going America is going to say "Well we're going to do to you what we did to China with Tik Tok you've uh built a nice uh affiliate here now u you you've got to sell it to American investors uh so that so that we can buy it we're uh we're forcing you to sell on national security grounds uh any dependency on a foreign investment that would include folks vagen BMW Germany if Trump decides that uh he doesn't like what Europe is doing uh uh everything is national security meaning whatever the uh the president wants to impose as a takeover to reward his campaign contributors by uh turning trade policy into a weaponized uh tool of foreign policy now uh just imagine uh I think we've said this before a folkvagen and uh uh BMW uh re have relocated to the United States trump is now essentially forcing them to uh and to disinvest because he said well uh we're going to impose high tariffs on the engines you make yes you may produce the cars in the United States by adding to the chassis and putting on the tires and assembling them but uh the largest cost of an automobile in the United States is the engine and uh we're going to keep the taxes on the engines uh that you're importing just like we do for Canada and Mexico uh the what Trump is doing is saying we're we're going to uh prevent you from making the lowerriced uh uh key to automobile the engines in Europe uh and you're going to on top of that you're going to have to pay all of the high high wage economy that uh we've turn created in America but what's so ironic is the slogan for America's industrial takeoff by that the protectionists used was the economy of high wages and their idea was to make wages uh uh high uh in order to increase the productivity well the problem is that the industrial capitalists didn't want to pay high wages there was a pretty vicious class war in the 1980s 1990s and riots that's what led to the populist party and to the uh uh all ultimately to socialism and so the government had a solution it said "All right uh you industrialists uh will uh will not have to pay labor high wages labor is going to get high wages because we are going to have public investment to provide the services that labor needs to live as I said education public health care social spending uh social structure uh public uh subsidized transportation public subsidized communication uh all of all of these things so that labor's living standards can rise without the industrialists having to actually pay more well that was a mixed public private economy that uh with the the government taking over more and more of the expenses and the uh the provision of services that labor needed to increase its living standards uh industrialists were able to avoid having to pay these costs themselves well look at what privatization has done uh by uh privatizing education health care uh communications transportation uh public utilities they've been turned into monopolies and their owners now charge monopoly rents on top of profits and they've their the financial sector has financed uh investment takeovers they borrowed money to take firms private or borrowed money just to take by control of firms adding the debt service and interest charges that companies have to pay to provide uh hitherto public services you have interest charges you have medical insurance charges you have uh monopoly profits monopoly rents over and above profits that's what's made the American economy so uh highriced and without recognizing that uh what we're living in today is not the industrial capitalism of the 19th century but the finance capitalism that's been put in place over the last 50 years that is uh makes its money by carving up and de-industrializing the economy not by industrializing it it's a whole different kind of capitalism that uh nobody in the 19th century uh imagined could actually develop to untrack the progressive line that industrial capitalism seemed to be taking prior to World War I richard it seems that Donald Trump and his Treasury Secretary are totally confused on the way that China has responded to the United States how do you see the response coming out of China is that is to we know that it's totally different from what it was in Donald Trump's first term and what is is that about the confidence in that China possess right now is that about the huge changes geopolitical changes that has happened during since then or how do you see that yes I think that the Chinese have become much more confident because they ought to it's the logical inference from what they have experienced at least as far back as Obama we know from the statements made by Obama those around him and everybody in power since that we need to quote unquote pivot to Asia that the American uh adversary now is China and everything has been done imaginable whether it's stationing the the seventh fleet in the South China Sea or rediscovering this dead horse called uh Taipei you know Taiwan and and that issue or the series of sanctions the series of tariffs by Trump then worsened by Biden i want to remind people Biden not only did not undo what Trump did he raised it he in the case of the electric cars that I think I've mentioned before on our program the BYD company's electric cars have 100% tariff they've had it already from Mr biden didn't they didn't wait for this crazy last few days 100% was already a Democratic contribution and what do the last 10 or 15 years because that's what it's been 10 or 15 years of effort to slow to stop Chinese growth it has failed it hasn't done that china is a bigger and more powerful force now than it was 10 years ago or 15 years ago or five years ago the alliance it has constructed the bricks is a bigger alliance more powerful than before you know the bricks produce now about 35% of total GDP in the world whereas the G7 the United States and its major allies produce about 27 28% and that gap is growing each year the United States is not the dominant economic omic power anymore that is the most for me the most important difference undermining everything so yeah the Chinese are very confident now and you can see it their response to these tariffs is much more confident than the ones that they suffered you know in the first term of Mr trump when he did that that sort of thing it doesn't seem to work they're able to maintain much faster rate of growth i mean the United States now has to even and hence you know I'll go back and and bother Michael again by saying desperation but you know when you turn on your allies in Europe and Canada and Mexico that's another sign of desperation you know the United here's a little statistic to remember the United States has 4 and a half% of the world's people the BRICS Alliance around China has 60% of the world's people i mean you need unspeakable advanced odds industrially and even militarily to offset that that's not going to happen the United States is losing each day that this continues and around the world the question really is given that what the United States still has is perhaps a military prepundonderance although I must say the Ukraine war to date which a couple of weeks ago the New York Times revealed has been a US versus Russia war all along in terms of the level extent of American military control of operations over there even that may be atrophying we are not in a strong position and that's what I see here i see economic policy you know crazy stuff hail Mary passes long shots uh that are taking enormous risks with very dubious chances of succeeding okay let's go with uh Richard's point of desperation and uh what they have to be desperate about uh the problem you can say how can the United States recover its former international dominance if it's no longer an industrial power if if it's industrially dependence it's as if it's weaponized trade against itself how can it u recover dominance when it's become an international debtor not an international creditor and most of all there's a moral issue here The United States in 1945 was able to pretend that its self-interest in creating a new system of world trade of world finance through the US dominated international monetary fund and the world bank they could say that this is creating a level playing field the word they love to use uh so that all nations are treated as equal that's been the ideal of international law ever since uh 1648 uh and other countries thought that the United States was wealthy enough that it could actually afford to believe that in spreading democracy meaning you have regime change to assassinate or remove any government that doesn't uh support the United States uh democracy like you have in Ukraine uh under Zalinski uh that uh that somehow this was going to uh give let other countries trust the United States trump has destroyed the trust in a way that is irreversible what he said is that the United States has to be the gainer in every uh trade agreement or economic agreement or loan agreement or military agreement that it makes everything is uh a win lose situation well uh when right after the initial market plunge after he announced the enormous increase in tariff rates he said "Well all of this is open for negotiation." And that of course is what he just said the other day he said "Well all right we're give you three months so I'm going to suspend the tariffs and I've told you how much I can hurt you." That's what America has to offer the world as we've said before America has the ability to maintain the power it had in 1945 by its ability to hurt other countries by weaponizing foreign trade by weaponizing international finance grabbing Russia's uh $300 billion of saving grabbing uh Venezuela's gold grabbing Iran's uh for foreign reserves when uh the Sha was overthrown uh Trump says "We can hurt you uh if you don't do what we want." Well if other countries say any agreement we make with the United States we're going to be hurt and we're going to be the losers can't we try to make a different arrangement there must be an alternative well they'd been trying for an alternative ever since uh the Bandon conference in Indonesia in the 19 uh50s under Asicarno but as we've said before they couldn't achieve an alternative because they didn't have a critical mass now thanks largely to China's growth and also the uh postsviet growth of Russia they have an alternative this is why the United States says China is our number one enemy the the size and magnitude of China and its alternative economic philosophy to that of American and European neoliberalism is what makes it a threat that for the first time now other countries have an alternative they can join together with uh mutual arrangements and that's just what they're doing you're already having Asian countries South Korea Japan um other countries trying to say isn't there a way that we can trade with each other and do without the American market well obviously there's going to be pain in a three month or even one year changeover from trade with the United States to trade with each other but now they see that mutual trade with each other uh with the bricks with the global majority with a global south that are consolidating their trade they don't need the United States uh because what Trump has done is in trying to isolate other other countries by trying to divide and conquer every single country by making one deal with you one deal with you with having no unified tariff policy but just what can we do to hurt each country in order other countries can say we can we can make the kind of world that seemed to be promised back in 1945 a world of where countries are equal where they follow the same economic rules and uh where we don't have to go down the track that is uh untracted the American and European economies by financialization monopolization uh untaxing the uh the wealthy and shifting the tax burden uh on to labor and making America and Europe an uncompetitive highcost economy where only the 10% and the behind them the 1% are really able to suck up all of the wealth into their own hands we can follow an economy that actually uh enriches our overall population and that will make our whole economy including the wealthiest classes rich uh there will be of course there will be some millionaires and probably many millionaires but these millionaires are going to be uh subject to uh social rules and structuring and tax policies that oblige them to use their wealth as part of a system of increasing the prosperity of the overall country not using their will to take over uh other corporations uh to raid them and become robber barons not to try to take over government and privatize it and turn public services into opportunities for monopoly but uh the kind of growth that really the whole 19th century of economists from Adam Smith to John Stewart Mill uh to the last great uh uh classical economists Markx uh all uh developed and uh explained that's their alternative and Trump has driven them together just like he's driven Russia and China together he his tariff uh policy and his threat to treat every other country as an economic opponent to be exploited so that he can end up the winner his doing this has driven them together to finally seek an alternative he's a revolutionist that you know two little amendments and then an inference from it one of the great beneficiaries of every one of these tariff countries around the world as they try to evade avoid minimize the impact of their tariff on them and they look for new trading partners in just the way Michael said one of the first places they're going to go is China because that's a place you can sell that's a place that produces lots of things you need to buy that's the biggest alternative to the United States there is right now so if you cut off your connection or even if you just reduce your connection to the United States China will benefit because they're going to be approached to do the replacement activity and if they have half a brain and they do they will make good deals they will take advantage they'll give you a good uh deal this year and maybe have to pay a bit more next year but help you make the transition now that's goodwill that's political i mean just look at it and if you wanted to wonder whether the replacement for the US dollar how it will be affected it'll of course be speeded up they've only made limited progress on that on that front they talk a lot they haven't done all that much but this will be a spur since more and more payments will be made without dollars because everybody's cutting back on dealing with the United States that means the demand for the use of dollars the need to hold dollars in reserves in private accounts in state accounts in central bank come on it's going to just speed up whatever steps need to be taken for alternative currencies uh to become normal in the world other than the US that's going to happen and then finally you know the whole world is going to figure out the United States currently has last time I looked 800 billionaires running from Mr musk with three or 400 billion on down okay 800 people if you needed to sharply and dramatically reduce the deficit of the United States simply taxing them such that everyone is reduced to between one and two billion dollar it means those 800 people will continue to be the richest people in the United States and likely the world but the government will get here we go trillions of dollars to use to pay to to to cover its bet to not have a deficit for the first time in many years to have taken dramatic steps to make the United States more creditw worthy and even if they took the money that they got that way used half of it to retire the the deficit reduce the deficit and the other half to take all kinds of creative steps to enhance US production technology productivity technical education all the things currently being cut i mean history will look back and say you know you actually could have changed the trajectory of your own decline but you chose not to do it you put into office leader after leader so beholden to the 800 billionaires that whatever you did had to leave them untouched by all of this giving yourself that constraint then hobbled you as to what alternative strategies you might have used so you're your own worst enemy because you can't do in all likelihood with your steps what you could have done with those 800 who couldn't have done much about it that's the irony of all of this it's its own self-imposed constraints that prevent Mr trump or for that matter the Democrats from even thinking about certain options they've been so excluded from the beginning that's that's when you see self-destruction and the one common theme that most historians have when they look back on the decline of other empires is how easy it is to see what they could have done to prevent or slow that decline and we all scratch our heads why didn't they and the answer is always their own political contradictions block them from either seeing or doing what they could have in fact done and we're right there and that is more evidence of a declining empire problem well Richard what you've described is that America's facing a similar problem to what Putin uh faced with the domestic kleptocrats how is he going to prevent the kleptocrats from taking over and uh doing what kleptocrats do well he's uh at least done something to draw draw them in line uh China faced a similar problem when you had Jack Ma for instance become so rich uh uh with his innovation uh China sort of uh cut him down to size uh they uh but if the Americans would do that uh it wouldn't be America and uh you mentioned that uh Trump has ended up his own worst enemy well there is a historical precedence for precedence for this uh in empires that you've just mentioned uh in around the fifth century BC uh the richest man in antiquity crois uh decided to increase his fortunes by uh attacking Persia so he went to the uh temple at Deli and said uh I I want to get even richer and uh conquered Persia and take over its gold to add to mine and uh the Deli oracle uh told him "You will destroy a great empire." And uh Crois attacked Persia uh was uh defeated and it turned out the empire that he destroyed was his own so that sounds pretty much what you've uh described uh for the for the United States that's what happens to uh over arrogant uh empire that's what happens to hubris and the wealthiest class uh the donor class the financial rontier class in the American economy combines hubris with the blind spot they don't see what you and I recommend that they would have to change who they are because they say "Well that's who that's who we are we're not going to change who we are because we are who we are and we're in control." That is what has made the United States in danger of falling or already has fallen into a failed economy well you know there's another another way to put the same thing and if you think about the remarkable fact if I have this correctly that there was a a million Americans went into the streets this last weekend in many many cities and towns across the United States to protest Trump's economic policies i know here in New York City where I live there were very sizable demonstrations here okay that leads to the joke that's circulating but maybe that joke has a lot of serious implications here's the joke the best recruiter for the American left today is Donald Trump well let's expand it maybe the best recruiter for the left as an alternative direction for the whole world right now is Mr trump he certainly is a world actor he has gone from being the center of attention in the United States to making himself the center of attention everywhere when I read the European newspapers the last few days he's in the front page every day he's now the center of attention everywhere which many people who comment on his personality I don't but who do uh say is something that's very satisfying for him may it may it be I'm not interested but I am interested in noticing that he is whatever his intention mobilizing the world as a critical mass and mobilizing the United States in a rather similar way and that's more evidence that this may be a very very transformative moment in American history and World history and world history thank you so much Richard and Michael great pleasure as always thank you take care
