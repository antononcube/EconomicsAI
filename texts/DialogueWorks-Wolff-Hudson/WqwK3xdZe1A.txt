what's your take on the current situation of the conflict between the west and Russia purchasing power parity of Russia right now it seems that they're getting better despite having this conflict for more than two years that was devastating that was huge for the Russian economy but it seems that they could manage the war and at the same time they could improve their economy how do you see the current situation okay um let me start with your last um your last Point uh the remarkable Improvement in the Russian economy over the last two years uh I want to remind everyone that immediately after Russia moved into Ukraine in February of 2022 there were predictions by Western leaders including uh President Biden uh that the Russian Ruble would dissolve be worthless that the Russian economy would collapse that Russia would be quote unquote on its knees as an economic system uh and there were serious academics and politicians beginning to get excited about the possibility of breaking Russia up into different uh ethnicities different nationalities um Ukraine would then become uh a model of what could happen to Georgia or any one of the other um parts of the old Soviet Union and none of that has happened um all of that has been uh wrong and I find it astonishing especially for Americans to find any of this surprising it suggests a misunderstanding not just of the specifics of Russia but of capitalist history capitalism is an unstable economic system it has constantly for 300 years wherever capitalism has settled in as the dominant economy which is practically the whole world now but wherever it has settled in it has an endless sequence of ups and downs inflations depressions recessions crashes crisis upturns downturns look at all the words and I could go on with more words because it's so buil in this instability you know I used to say to my classes when I taught economics in the University I used to lean across the podium and say to my students if you lived with a roommate as unstable as capitalism you would have moved out years ago why do you accept this the National Bureau of economic research says capitalism has a downturn on average every four to seven years well look at the United States we had a crash the so-called Doom crash in the year 2000 we had the so-called subprime mortgage crash in the year 2008 we had the covid-19 crash in the year 2020 roughly 21 years rough three crashes once every seven years right on time right on schedule and it's been true so what do we know we know that the system crashes sometimes out of its own economic processes sometimes a war or sometimes some other big political event can send it off some people think the one we had in 2020 was somehow made much worse or stimulated by the pandemic okay what was the most recent catastrophe for Russia the end of the Soviet Union in 1989 and 90 A system that had been the system for about 70 years imploded it collapsed on itself and Russia went into a very deep depression it lasted into the 19 through the 1990s and into the new century okay the similar catastrophe for the United States was the collapse of 1929 that ushered in the Great Depression of the 1930s the worst of the capitalist downturns in capitalism's history and now here comes the answer to the question how did the United States Escape finally from a depression that began in October of 1929 and didn't stop through the 1930s well the answer is the United States went to war the war was known as World War II and in that war the United States economy soared it overcame its depression the war didn't destroy the American economy it rescued the American economy and anybody who's paid attention knows it they know that suddenly for example ex Le the unemployment problem was solved because you took half the unemployed and put them in a uniform in the military and you took the other half of the unemployed and put them in a factory with a job making the uniform and making the airplane and making the guns and the bullets and all the rest and when the war was over the United States was the most powerful economic player in the world so then tell me not just you Nema but your whole audience why should anyone be all that surprised that in the war between Russia and Ukraine it turns out to be good news for the economic development of Russia they're just repeating ing what the United States did and for the United States leaders not to see it not to notice it not to make a reference to it that tells you that the American leaders are very out of touch they don't understand that the world has changed and that Russia is now in a position to learn from what the United States did did and do it again here's another way to get at this and we've talked about this before Russia has been depending very much on the export of oil and gas so the Americans and the Europeans decided they could help the war effort of the Ukrainian Army by imposing what they call the mother of all sanctions on Russia basically no longer buying oil and gas that's why the north stream pipeline was destroyed so that the Russians literally could not send uh energy through the pipe into Germany which is where it would have gone okay that was a terrible miscal calculation they didn't understand how the world has changed one of the ways the world changed is that we now have a very close economic and political alliance between Russia and China we also have the environment that they've created in the bricks 11 countries working together that include you know I think almost half the population of the world in that block it's now richer it's certainly much bigger than the only other Block in the world economy which is the United States and its allies the G7 but the bricks are bigger now than the G7 and the gap between them is growing and why did that relevant because the United States miscalculated it didn't understand that the Russians could and would successfully appeal to India and China to buy the oil and gas that they could no longer sell to Europe and the irony here is incredible back in the 1970s the United States sent President Nixon and Secretary of State Henry Kissinger to China the purpose was to drive a wedge between Russia and China they had come to military confrontation in the 1960s so there was a reasonable chance to to split them well the United States has been working at that for 50 years and I would say that one can successfully call that one of the greatest foreign policy failures in history Russia and China are closer together now than they were then much closer this is a policy that has failed and now it has failed in Ukraine they didn't take it into account they don't understand it they are blind to it they are denying that it exists they are surprised that they're so alone in supporting Israel While most of the rest of the world supports Gaza and the Palestinians another miscalculation of how the world is changing so for me I see what happened in Russia as no surprise but it's a very clear sign that the Western power led by the United States is systematically disconnected from the world and making one big mistake after another I mean to be truthful the war in Vietnam was a war that the United States lost the war in Iraq was a war that the United States lost the war in Afghanistan lost and the one in Ukraine now being lost okay last point the way the United States handles this changed world besides denying it and making one miscalculation after another is that there creeping into American politics is a growing desperation they have not been able to stop this Mr Trump tried a trade War didn't work Mr Trump and Mr Biden have continued the Tariff War War didn't work they send Mr blinkin or Janet Yellen or others to Beijing to try to persuade them to change their economic system it doesn't work meanwhile the Chinese have now won the competition they have the highest quality lowest price electric cars and trucks in the world they can match techn logical developments by the United States which is having a harder time matching Chinese technical developments those are the truths and so it's very frustrating for successive leaders two weeks ago Mr Biden raised the T the Tariff on electric cars and trucks from what it was 27 and a half% to the higher amount 100% that's the behavior that in economic textbooks is called protectionism the United States government is protecting its own automobile car and truck industry because otherwise the world would only buy the Chinese trucks and cars CU they're better and cheaper but the problem is if the rest of the world can buy cars and trucks for half roughly of what Americans are going to have to pay well that's going to show up in an inflation here relative to the prices everywhere else they don't have to pay a tariff for a Chinese truck the United States has to pay $60,000 for a $30,000 Chinese truck and it can buy an American competitor but the American competitor will take advantage of the protection by taking a a a less good car and charging $50,000 for it but the American will have no choice he'll buy the $50,000 car or truck and then raise his prices to get that money back and that puts him at a competitive disadvantage and so he'll he'll have less sales and he will fire workers because he does doesn't need them to produce what he cannot sell so an honest leader not Mr Biden an honest one would say I'm raising the Tariff to protect the profits and the jobs in this industry but I know it jeopardizes profits and jobs in lots of other Industries and I don't know which will be larger will the net effect be more or fewer jobs no one knows no one has ever done the kind of exhaustive research which would allow you to make a guess and no one can know in advance these are speeches that are given to win votes they have nothing to do with the actual reality Biden recently gave a speech in the last few days talking about how the Chinese economy is in terrible shape what do you what is this if he really believes it then he's ignorant I don't think he's particularly ignorant so I say he's giving a speech to win votes by telling people what he thinks they want to hear okay that's what he's doing but it would be wiser not to keep saying things that are so untrue that a certain part of your audience is now going to turn against you because they don't believe they can trust what comes out of your mouth you ought to think about that some more because there's lots of people like me that are going around and explaining to people that are tariff is inflationary it drives up the prices this is a government that is telling people it's against inflation but its tariffs are inflationary and I could go on and on and on the economy that is in ever deeper difficulty is the United States it has no business pointing to difficulties elsewhere it will have all it can do to try to cope with the problems it has here at home yeah Richard the United States is forced to borrow approximately A8 trillion dollar every 100 days is that what strategic defeat looks like has the United States lost the war with China well I wouldn't say it's the how defeat looks I would say it's how the United States is coping with defeat and in order to understand that give me a moment to explain borrowing and government deficits and all of that because it is not well understood the government has two ways of raising money one way is to tax you can tax individual working people or you can ta tax business profits or as we do here in the United States both of them the second way you can raise money is not by taxing but by borrowing money the United States government borrows money as you just pointed out it's currently borrowing at a rate of $3 trillion a year or roughly a trill ion dollar every hundred days more or less okay why is the government borrowing money the answer is because it does not want to tax to raise that money could it tax yes of course it could the government has the power to T the president and the Congress rough 4 500 people can get together and pass a tax so the government has a choice and every government makes that choice and I would worry that your audience includes people who don't quite get that when the government borrows it's because it does not want to tax it could spend just as much money on social programs on the military on you name it it could spend the same amount of money that it is spending now and raise taxes by $3 trillion and then it wouldn't have to borrow a nickel okay so let's follow the logic why does the government not do that here you come to a peculiarity of American electoral politics they could go and they could tax either corporations as businesses or the rich people that own and dominate those corpor they could tax corporations and the rich the problem is any politician from the president through the Senators and Congress persons and so anybody who does that will immediately incur the hostility of Corporations and the rich because they don't want to pay more taxes and they have a powerful weapon they say to the politicians if you tax us we will withdraw from you all of the money we normally donate to your candidacy to your political party to the media which carries stories that are favorable to you and not only will we take all that away from you we will give it to whoever is running against you in the election so you'll be gone we will get rid of you all right the government could say okay we're going to tax Working Class People they can do that they can hit you with a higher gasoline tax or a higher cigarette tax or a higher income tax or a Phil lots of taxes but here the working class over the years has come up with their version of no if you tax us we won't vote for you we will vote for whoever is running against you okay now the politicians have a problem the corporations and the rich want the government to help them to protect them to give them all kinds of services and the mass of the working class wants the government to give them services to give them support so the two potential taxpayers want the government to spend money but don't want to pay taxes the solution for the politicians is therefore obvious we risk losing if we don't deliver the government services and we risk losing if we try to tax to pay for the services solution we will borrow the money and and here it's very important to understand from whom does the government borrow it borrows from corporations and the rich because nobody else has any money to lend to the government the working class nowhere lends to the government a few people do but it's not significant the government goes to corporations to the rich and sometimes to other government but that's it that's basically where the government borrows and of course for the corporations if you think about it this is ideal because if you're a corporation think the government could come and tax me and take away half my profits or I could lend have my my profits to the government after a few years they will give me that money back cuz I own it meanwhile every year they will pay interest to me while they hold that money so for the corporations and the rich this is a no-brainer of course rather than be tax you would prefer that the government borrow from you now if you're a corporate and a rich and you don't worry about the mass of people there is of course another solution which is to cut Social programs but that's that's dangerous because you might produce a movement from below that throws the whole system into doubt so it's better threaten that talk about that occasionally for a little while impose that in Europe it's called austerity but not for very long you will go back you won't tax corporations in the rich you won't tax the masses you'll borrow from the corporations and the rich the money they have because they didn't have to pay taxes they lend it to the government and it will just accumulate but the problem here is is and this is hegel's dialectic the solution to one problem provokes the next problem so now you have an accumulating debt the United States debt is now larger than its GDP used to be much smaller than GDP and you have to service the debt you have to pay interest and here we get two interesting contradictions number one the second largest lender of money to the United States government is the People's Republic of China because they own currently $800 billion worth of US debt it requires the government in Washington to collect taxes from you and me and take a portion of them not to be used for any social program not to be used for any public service they simply take billions of dollars and hand them over to XI jingping in China who can use it any way he wants for example to build up his nuclear missile collection paid for by the United States now notice politicians saved corporations and the rich from taxes borrowed the money from them in part and from China in part and now has to deliver interest payments to the People's Republic of China it could have avoided funding the Chinese military if it had been willing to tax its own corporations and the rich but it wasn't and at some point in the future there'll be a congressman or woman who will call that treason and with some justice they will do that so you have have to remember that this is not so much a decline of the Empire it is rather a symptom that slowly the capitalist system at home has accumulated too many problems that have been solved by pushing them away or As Americans like to say kicking the can down the road and you can't do that forever eventually and I believe next year will be the first year next year the amount of interest that will have to be paid on the United States National Debt will be larger than the total amount of money provided to the Pentagon for military activity okay this is becoming a difficulty how are you going to protect and the United States doesn't have enough weapons in Ukraine the Russians have more artillery they have more artillery shells here's a country that's nowhere near as rich as the United States but it's not running out of ammunition the United States is these are all each one of them small but you add them up and there you see the decline of American capitalism interwoven with the decline of the American Empire and all of that is showing up in all of these little places that aren't so little and that are becoming more and more emblematic of the larger change the St Petersburg International economic Forum when it comes to this forum and comparing with the world economic Forum how do you find the difference between these two forums is the difference similar to what we what we've been witnessing between bricks and G7 absolutely you're just seeing the same story play out you know 20 years ago there was one World Bank and there was one international monetary fund and one world economic forum and they all reflected the dominance of the United States of the US dollar of the United States allies all of that and now the world is adjusting just like every individual country is deciding if we need a loan here in Africa we won't go as we always did before to London or Washington we're going to go to Beijing and we're going to take whichever offer is better for us here in Nigeria or here in Paraguay or here in Malaysia it's just everybody is changing and so some years ago uh the Russian government decided they don't want the intern excuse me the international economic annual meetings to be dominated by politicians and institutions that are not friendly to them and so they develop their own and so you're going to have very similar if you read the two mission statements the little paragraph for the world economic forum and the little paragraph for the St Petersburg International economic Forum they're very similar but they are they are for two different audience and the bricks will go more to the Russian and the G7 will go more to the other one you can see it it's very obvious there are a few countries that will go to both of them and that'll be interesting to see whether that number shrinks in the next few years or whether there'll be more countries that will try somehow to have an alliance with both of them but my guess is that both of will make that more and more difficult we've learned that turkey that wanted to be part of the EU since 1999 they want to be part of bricks right now that would be huge in terms of NATO because turkey is so important within NATO how do you see the changes that are happening in the Middle East well I think you already have in the bricks if I if I remember correctly Egypt is already in the bricks Saudi Arabia is Iran this is this is catastrophic for Israel this is catastrophic in the long run for the United States assuming it stays in Alliance with Israel um I think you're you're seeing the world adjusting I think Mr erdogan in Turkey is looking at his options he is a leader of turkey but also he is a a party politician and and making his decision other Turkish politicians will make different decisions and try to get the support that erdogan got from the United States for them all of that will happen but the bottom line is whoever wins in Turkey is going to feel enormous pressure and look the same country Turkey which decided and I believe it's a very popular decision to no longer trade with Israel I believe just two or three weeks ago yeah um they are not going to be Israel's friend politically either and that gives a whole new uh Islamic Republic with the Palestinians and again and these are defeats for the United States these are defeats it will not get the votes it wants it will not get the money it wants these are all symptoms of this change in the world economy that one country after another is going to make these decisions yeah at this point there's nothing the United States can do and maybe it believes that it can make life so unpleasant for the Russians by having ukrainians throw missiles at them and so that they can get the Russians to agree to undo what they have won in the Ukraine frankly I don't see it I don't see the evidence for that but stuff can be hidden and I don't know if if the current situation or how exactly the current situation will be resolved but the direction of change is unmistakable nobody that I'll extend nobody I know of is fighting like crazy to join the G7 the brick started out with five countries then uh whatever it was six months ago another six joined them and they've only lost one which is uh Argentina and that's because a extreme rightwing politician uh who is who may not be altogether mentally okay so it's very hard to know how long he'll survive the Biden Administration together with Europeans are not recognizing that the war in Ukraine has been lost they don't need to be anymore in this war they have to just let it go let go after some sort of political settlement but you don't see even Europeans it seems to me that they're getting more radical instead of getting more rational how we can understand this type of behavior well I I think you put your finger on it the only way I make sense of it is that for 70 years they got used to being the junior partner of the United States you know they are conservative politicians who are in office in almost every European country are people who have been celebrating and defending the United States and Western capitalism for a very long time they don't want to let go they are like the conservatives in this country they want to be Republicans and they want to go backwards this is becoming the behavior of a child who is confronted with a world that is not friendly anymore doesn't allow you to be the the boss doesn't defer to you look at the United States when when they lost the votes in the United Nations about genocide about you know they're not used to this they're just not used to it and they don't want to become used to it yeah that's their problem and I think you're seeing these escalations for two reasons one the Biden Administration has decided it's to dangerous for the election to come to some kind of end because Trump will AC accuse Biden of losing the war so they can't they can't let something happen quickly well can they let something happen slowly so that you know the peace treaty isn't signed until after November when the election is over well I think that's probably what they are going to do but they're worried about having put all these resources all this effort and they come away with next to nothing this is going to expose them in a new way politically they've lost it economically they've lost their resources they didn't have enough milit fighting they didn't have enough it's a very bad looking long-term situation the only thing they'll have is if they get some land back or if at least they have something they can call a victory even if only a small number of people really see it that way but I think that that's that's it they want to look as though they're tough some of them I think probably believe that if they keep it up long enough Russia will collapse know wishful thinking but it's typical Americans love to think and they're always surprised when that isn't the case yeah thank you Richard for being with us today great pleasure as always I hope you found it interesting I think as usual Nema you are you are talking about the key issues if I could leave you with any thought on your audience with any thought the changing World economy the international flow of goods services and capital is radically altered these days by the goodbye from Russia and uh to the Ukraine and to the efforts of the West we're turning East our future lies in the East we are part of bricks this is look smart Western European leaders always worried about Russia and the Soviet Union they worried either that they would attack them or the opposite that they would abandon them and the irony is they are now behaving with their escalations in such a way that is going to make Russia literally turn it's back on Europe and in the long run that is not good for Europe at all what it is doing is creating a world economy in which the United States is one pole China is the other and Europe is what the military used to call collateral damage and you see it already not being able buy oil and gas has made the price of energy in Europe go very high and that prices their products out of the World Market everybody's buying China or America because they haven't had the collapse of their energy in fact the Europeans are buying energy from the United States this is self-defeating you can't keep doing this you get you get you shoot yourself in the foot and and we are watching we are watching the decline of American capitalism and the decline of the American Empire the two things often go together so that isn't unusual but the level of denial the level of pretending this isn't happening even when the link between that and big mistakes and miscalculations is obvious that that's the Achilles Hill that's the vulnerable part of the West which it has not begun to understand or get under control
