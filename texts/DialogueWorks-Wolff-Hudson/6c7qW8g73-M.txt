hi everybody today's Thursday December 19th and Richard and Michael are back with us welcome back glad to be here let's get started Richard and Michael with what Jake soln said about the conflict in Ukraine and the way that the Biden Administration is just seeing the situation let me play a clip of Jake Sullivan describing that and I think as democracies to think oh we're not doing so great and those dictators are so strategic and they're doing so well if I had told you three years ago that Joe Biden was going to announce a special military operation to take Ottawa in a week and three years later he was in the wheat fields of Manitoba losing thousands of soldiers a month uh with inflation over 10% and interest rates in America over 20% 600,000 Americans either dead or wounded and were inching out little Canadian town by little Canadian town this is the Trump plan by the way I don't know if you know this yeah yeah I mean you would have said you wouldn't sit here saying wow uh America's really winning that war in a big way that's great for America you would never say that but somehow we're saying oh the Russians they're doing great they are not doing great they set out on a strategic objective of taking the capitol keev wiping Ukraine as we know it off the map maybe not literally wiping the country off the map but wiping a democratic the regime out independent Western oriented Ukraine gone it would be a vassel state to Russia y and they have failed in that and they will fail in that they are now fighting uh and and imposing huge costs and I don't want to Discount those costs but let's not forget that keev stands Ukraine stands Ukraine will stand at the end of this and the thing we can most do is create circumstances for a negotiation where they have some strength and capacity behind them and it is not imposed upon them and that's what I would like to see uh in the months ahead and and frankly I believe that whether it was President Trump which it will be or it were president Harris had she won this turn to negotiations is something that zilinsky was looking to do it was necessary yeah now we have an opportunity but that opportunity should rest on the proposition that Ukraine is in the driver's seat and is not going to have an outcome imposed upon well and and NATO is stronger and people are spending more money and more committed to it and there are two additional members and I mean you know Assad just fell and I mean there are a lot of ways that anyone objective can say the Russians are not winning uh I think there are lots of ways objectively to say the ukrainians are not winning too to be fair that is fair and it's important actually to to pause on that point for a moment because my account really kind of only speaks to one side of it I mean what has been visited upon the ukrainians on the brave Soldiers on the front lines on people innocent people in towns and cities having missiles and bombs rain down on them on Putin attempting to plunge the country into cold and darkness in the heart of Winter and so much else I mean I'm not trying to be Cavalier about any of that that is real uh now at the same time that that is happening the Ukrainian people want to make sure that they are not just stopping the war for the sake of it they want a just peace and we should support them in wanting a just peace yeah here is the the question right now would be are we getting are we heading toward a new escalation in the conflict in Ukraine because it seems that with this new assassination of a Russian general which was by far one of the most important figures that was assassinated by ukrainians where are we heading and what's your take Richard on what Jake Sullivan said about the conflict well I think the best way to understand Jake Sullivan is to listen closely this is a loser the poor man is in a terrible position everything he tried to do he's failed at doing and he's about to be kicked out of his job and he has to try to make the best of what is a disaster for him I want to remind people after the bravado of listening to him and you know it verges from the pathetic to the outrageous I mean he's commiserating with the Ukrainian people while he is the leader of the funding both in terms of money and weapons of a genocide in the Palestine what his concern for people suffering what are you talking about I mean that that's a level of lying that rises to the point you ought to give him an award not not for what he says that's trivial but for keeping the straight face the same thing is true with talking about who's winning and losing the war he says lots of people are dying there's no question that that's true the numbers are a little fudgy he's trying to make his sad situation look bad but you don't measure the success or loss of a war by counting up who's dying especially when the numbers are given to you by the participants who have every reason to fudge the numbers I mean this is childish what's going on here the United States is fighting a war proxy war with Russia that's what's going on and the attempt was to block the Russians from taking over somewhere between 20 25% of the country of Ukraine that effort has failed that's called losing not winning losing should I say it again losing and the man is so troubled by having to put on the table we weren't able to prevent the Russians from moving across not just to take those initial oblasts on the border with Russia but much more territory I mean what are you talking about look at the look at the desperate nonsense the Russians were he's going to tell us what the Strategic goals of Russia were we're supposed to listen to this man who's losing the war and the whole world knows it by the way I read European newspapers every day and they are with America they want the ukrainians to win but they're not crazy they understand oh this not going real well to say the least you know this is childish behavior this is the desperate rantings of somebody who wants to make something positive you know the dictators around the world this lovely self stroking you know which is a kind of political and ideological masturbation we are the Democracy they are the dictator ship I mean what in the world are you kidding you really want us to live in that childish world and his answer is yes because for him it isn't a childish world it's the real world he inhabitat you know it is childish but it's his world there are the goods and the bads and he's here to tell you the bads are being van by the goods this is a fouryear old's uh little book story to be told before they go to sleep so they don't have nightmares but this is the this is the the rantings of a loser and if I were a psychiatrist I would have fun Mr Trump has recently been referring to Justin trudo as the governor of the 51st state of the United States okay and what comes to Mr Jake Sullivan's mind is the idea that the parallel would be if the United States tried to take over Ottawa in Canada yeah but you know that's a very convenient Story the Russians were not part of a revolution 10 years ago in that country that changed the politics and that had very little to do with democracy and a great deal to do with large power Maneuvers against each other so I really think this is it's childish this the behavior of a loser everyone knows that if the Russians wanted to they are the dominant power they are much bigger than Ukraine it it was in the cards from the beginning that a war between Russia and Ukraine would be over in a matter of days because it would be a struggle of unequal uh combatant which is why the United Collective West declared war on Russia a sanctions war and funding war and a weapons war and your worry Nema about escalation let me me conclude by reminding everyone escalation has been going on in that war from the beginning in the weeks after February 2022 from President Biden on down it and the defense minister Austin and so on that this was a war that Russia would lose that the Russian economy would collapse that the Russian Ruble would become worthless etc etc etc it was a war against the country laughingly described as a gas station masquerading as a country here we are three years just about three years into the war the ruble hasn't collapsed the Russian economy is doing better than it did before the war does it have problems of inflation yes does it have other problems of course it does it's a large country living in a complicated world it's easy to find the co problems of a country because they're always there which means finding them is a bit of an empty exercise you big Faker what are you doing the gap between the United States and China has gotten narrower because the Chinese are growing faster that's a victory for them they set out to grow faster 30 40 years ago and they have done it every year since the IMF for this year 2024 the IMF this year says the US economy will grow 2.8% every Ally in Europe will grow less than that Russia will grow more than than that China will grow 4.8% nearly double and India 7% nearly triple this is not what are you talk does India have problems of course it does does China have problems absolutely but once you want if you want to really look at this situation if you're not a ranting excuse provider which is all Mr Jake Sullivan could amount to be and ever has been then you carefully avoid what I just said and you say they have problems oh my God you know that's like saying that I have analyzed the United States when I point out H we just assassinated the CEO of a health care company not such a good sign that our poor poverty rate is going up that we have inflation that yesterday's stock market Tanked because of the anxieties about INF be I could I list problems of the United States of course I could it's childish the question is what's the balance how do you put together the good signs and the bad signs to come up with it it's as if the doctor you went to see because you're really feeling bad put a thermometer in your mouth said Gee 98.6 go home you're fine you would understand you went to the wrong doctor there's blood tests and urine test and hundreds of things that doctors have to give them a sense of how to evaluate the good news that the tests give you and the bad news to come up with a diagnosis and an assessment any reasonable person would do that especially on a television program where he's supposed to be interviewed by someone who's looking for a balanced understanding you know what we getting instead cheap advertising executive mentality tell all the good things bury all the bad things and you've communicated no you haven't communicated anything you're desperately trying to sell something Jack and you ought to admit to your audience that communication is not what you're about selling is what you're about having sold himself he's now trying to sell the dying Embers of a regime that he will be stuck with all the rest of his reputational life he is a loser and he's behaving in the worst traditions of losers he hasn't risen above to give assessment and I'm not so worried about the escalations you know why because sad losers like Mr Sullivan or Mr Biden or the rest of them they have escalated throughout the war in Ukraine I want to remind you all since I'm not an Advertiser they promised not to sell uh to zalinski the f-16s they're there they promised not to provide him with the Abrams Tanks they're there there has been escalation step by step and only somebody who's an advertising Hustler rather than an analyst would suggest that it's all on one side that the escalation has occurred I mean it's childish it's an endless effort by a five-year-old having broken the cookie jar to try to explain to his parents somehow that jar fell off the shelf and I saw the broken jar and there was a cookie other than that I had nothing to do with it I am a total Innocent but you with Mr Sullivan you say democracy to try to say it as often as you possibly can the Democracy of the United States he's a member of an Administration that tried to jail and imprison Mr Trump for being an enemy of democracy you see how well that went but he's learned nothing from what he's doing and so the same tired old neon Cold War mentality is once more on display but I understand him that's how he got the big job he has so he's going out the way he came in it is very very boring Michael well Nima your quote should be a textbook classic in how to spin a losing diplomacy uh it's wonderful uh Sullivan and blinkin are trying to create some kind of a face- saving narrative it's all about the narrative how are you going to frame what's happening in some way uh in which uh us and NATO come out above Russia so you can say we've won not that we've lost uh his task is H how do you choose some dimension in which uh the United States and Via President Biden uh himself Sullivan and his partner blinkin come out as a hero well to just to go back to what really happened to ground the issue Russia did not choose to invade Ukraine so it's not that Russia had a false plan to conquer a country and lost uh it it uh it was forced to defend luhansk and uh the donat from the Nazi attack on civilians it was a Nazi attack because it was racist treating the Slavs uh uh as a race it was against civilians it was terrorists it's everything that the world thought of being Nazism in World War I when there really seemed to be a fight for civilization about what are the values what are the values of how how a country uh could fight a war what how uh individual countries should try to control and interfere with the internal affairs of other countries uh this was the whole whole setting of the nurenberg trials and it really seemed to be uh never again uh was was this going to happen uh Russia was facing pretty much the same situation that it faced in 1941 uh against uh the Nazis and that's how the Russians have uh dis leadership have described the situation to their own population it's uh it's the same Nazi Banner of the Bandera uh supporters of the Nazis back at the beginning of World War II it's the same attack on civilians it's the same breaking of all of the rules of war that people thought were uh were civilized so these were Neo-Nazi attacks and uh Russia never aimed at conquering Kiev that's why uh Putin said this is a special military operation were not after Kev that would take a big a big fight and there is no indication today that Russia wants Kiev unless it's uh a part of the denazification uh of the Ukraine so their aim was to drive the Nazis out of uh donbas and luhans to protect the russian-speaking population that uh Putin took uh responsibility for and whose population very quickly voted to become part of Russia to protect itself against the attack on it so when you you look at that uh fight that was initiated by NATO by the United States and Britain uh uh doing most of the shots Russia is the big winner and it's a big winner not only in Ukraine but on the world stage this fight in Ukraine is not a Ukrainian war against by Ukraine against Russia it's the war of the United States Britain and NATO against Russia China and the rest of the world for Domination that's the big picture and that's how you should think of what's happening there the United States has lost Europe as a result of the uh sanctions against importing Russian oil and gas this destroyed German industry uh that has uh destroyed uh uh EUR European uh food markets in Russia uh because the sanctions against exporting food to Russia have led Russia to become self-sufficient in everything from vegetables to cheese to of course uh grain of which it's the largest world exporter now uh the war in in uh Ukraine has driven uh Russia and China together saying that this war isn't about Ukraine this is the first step in the war against uh the us as uh together as the leaders of the bricks and taking the lead in uh because of our self-sufficiency and our economic strength in creating an alternative to the us- centered unipolar uh world that's really uh what this is about uh the United States sanctions have ended up instead of isolating Russia and uh China it's isolated itself from the world leaving Europe in such a uh state of financial economic and demographic collapse that it cannot uh continue the way it is that's why we've just seen the German government fall uh in the last few weeks we've seen uh elections cancelled the United States says uh a democracy can only be supported in the United States because the United States is the only Democratic country we're supporting democracy in Ukraine we're supporting democracy in Israel against the Palestinians we're supporting democracy now in Syria uh with Al-Qaeda just as we supported democracy in Afghanistan by overthrowing the civilian government by uh backing the Taliban uh this is uh an attempt to use uh combine a narrative with a new kind of language that if they can manipulate language manipulate the narrative they will not have the American public thinking what I think Donald Trump was saying years ago this was a disaster we didn't have any business there instead of uh somehow strengthening America's power against uh Russia and China uh We've we've lost power throughout the world and this is what the in Ukraine is about it's about the world not the Ukraine uh and so uh the the United States is sort of faced with the fact that the rest of the world is a gas at what the US is doing not only in Ukraine uh but ukrainians training terrorists in Syria to uh to attack China in the sang uh Province the the wigers uh just as it was training the uh terrorists uh to uh the beslam the uh attacks in Russia so imagine what's happening Russia you uh and China realize that this fight in Ukraine against Russia is to weaken Russia so it cannot support China while the United States uh plans its attack on China as uh Biden said the number one designated uh enemy in the world so the question to get back to uh I guess what uh Richard's final question is what is going to happen in the closing days of the Biden Sullivan blinkin Administration uh obviously the assassination of the Roman general who had been exposing the United States bioweapon uh labs in Ukraine and the uh the anti-il biological warfare there uh was an attempt to go Russia yet again into making a major response that the United States and NATO would then use for some plan that we don't know for a a huge configration that uh incoming president Trump could not stop well what's going to happen if President Putin says I'm not going to be sucked into this plan uh we're we're we're obviously winning not in not only in Ukraine but by winning in Ukraine we're also winning the world uh re restructuring so I think the danger is the United States is going to try to say well Russia won't respond we've got to have a false flag attacks that's what the US is really good at organizing false flag attacks like a way back in uh Iraq in Syria claiming that uh uh they used uh weapons uh false flag attacks in Ukraine uh they're going they're probably going have something desperate that they've got to do in the closing days of the Biden Administration to somehow uh disrupt and create such a degree of chaos that uh Mr Trump will be confronted with a situation saying if you stop now president Trump then you'll be the Leer the ler the loser you'll end end up giving away the whole game to Russia as if the game is about Ukraine and not about uh the leadership of Bricks by Russia China uh and Iran uh so you you have to look at Ukraine in the context of what's happening in Syria what's happening in uh Palestine and uh see that it's all part of a common picture that the rest of the world is able to read on the internet see on television and understand uh a very different narrative from what uh blinkin and Sullivan are presenting to the US uh people it's all about the narrative and I guess uh what your show is all about is saying here's here's the reality not the narrative who are you going to believe your eyes or Mr Sullivan Richard let me let me also add every poll that I've looked at including polls run by gallop and other Western indicate that Mr Putin is a fairly popular leader certainly much more popular than his adversaries and that may be very easy to explain he's the winner we're the loser that's a clue you'll often find that the winner gets to be kind of popular in the society where he's winning and the other one don't and I'm no partisan of Mr Putin he's got lots of problems as a leader and the country had none of his childish good people versus bad people narrative when I would hope my fellow Americans and those of you around the world that are watching would recognize in the clip you showed this mental it in the United States that exists as if the whole world was a morality play in which the name of the audience the the purpose of the audience is to identify with the good character and join in condemning the bad one I have this very complicated idea I'm joking that good and bad coexist in all of us Mr s too and that's an insult to the rest of us to talk to us in this way what are you who are you lecturing you are lecturing what it's like the United States being outraged to discover that Russia or for that matter a dozen other countries maneuver into the election process in hopes of an outcome favorable to them of course they do and you know who's been the leader of that for the last half century the United States which has more means and more wealth with which to do that and so it has of course done that remember the embarrassing moment when Mr Trump reveals to the leader of Germany Mrs Merkel that he hears her conversations on her cell phone before she does right this is well known what is the childish purpose of pretending that this complexity that we learn about and see all the time should be reduced by the leader of a powerful company country into morality play a final thought murdering on the street a general in Russia what is that exactly going to accomplish my guess nothing it's a tragedy for that family no doubt but after all how hard is it I follow the information the general was coming out of his apartment house where he lives he had no security no police around him no army battalion uh checking out on what no wasn't necessary so he became an easy target guess what Russia's a big country there will be an assistant general who will now be promoted to replace the general you just killed and to to finish the thought so people have no misunder understanding were the Russians to have the mentality of a loser desperately trying to provoke his enemy into an action that might change this war then the Russians have all the means Way Beyond what the ukrainians have to assassinate their leaders you have to ask yourself why aren't they doing that and the answer is they don't need to you don't want to face what that means so you don't ask the question but a reasonable person would could Russia be bombing Kiev all the time of course it could air defenses in in Ukraine have been destroyed now for months could they do it could they do to the centers of population what the Israelis are doing in Gaza and the West R sure they could but they're not and you have to ask well why not it's not because the Russians are good I'm not going to go down that road that's childish it's because they don't need to Mr Sullivan can mock the little Villages they're taking one by another although among the little Villages were large cities he left that out because again he's not evaluating the situation he's an advertising Hustler trying to tell a story of good and bad but the reality is that the Russians need security as they have said they want a buffer zone as they have said they are doing that they are making nice progress against all of the efforts even now the attack them's missiles and and they had to show the West after they promised by the way earlier not to use the attacks like they promised not to give them the high Mars multiple rocket launchers the the Patriot missiles all of it step by step by step so they finally say okay remember just two or three weeks ago you can use the attack of missiles and you can shoot them into into the heart of Russia which then zalinski did what did the Russians do did they Panic did they send missiles into Kiev to kill the population centers no they showed them a new missile targeted a military place did an extraordinary job and demonstrated that they have a missile against which there is no defense which again should surprise no one in an arms race the Russians demonstrated in the first half of the 20th century that they can keep up much poorer country but when it comes to Arms they understood you better have the best arms or you're in in deep trouble and the Russians have understood that more and better than any country probably on Earth Napoleon made the mistake of not understanding that and then in the first world war they didn't get it and then in the second war Hitler didn't get it we're now not getting it again this hello they're very good at this military business I don't admire that kind of thing so I'm not saying it out of a great praise I'm saying if you're realistic why are you choosing the most developed military apparatus that has had two centuries of demonstrating that it is going to be giving that an extraordinary priority last point if you take the bricks the original five countries Brazil Russia India China and South Africa and you add the six countries that have since joined and then you add the Dozen more that said they were planning to join at the Kazan meetings a month ago well I I want your audience to understand that's a majority of the people on this planet by comparison the American population of the United States is 4 and a half% of the people on this this planet Mr Sullivan is acting as though he doesn't know those numbers the United States is looking more and more like a famous cartoon character that I used to see as a child it's a cartoon in which the leading character typically a bird is seen running off the edge of a cliff and it keeps running beyond the limit of the cliff and then suddenly looks down and realizes there is no cliff and then plunges downward and we all laugh that's Mr Sullivan well then Richard what you're talking about is the the context should be what's civilization all about uh are its values under attack well obviously they are and uh what countries are the threat to civilization and who's defending the principles of civilization I think that people for the first time really since World War II were beginning to uh react uh ask about thieves and uh the United States is trying to take a tunnel vision and uh try to uh keep the frame of reference very low uh the the one thing that is supposed to be the enemy of civilization is chaos and terrorism uh Trump began it when he killed Iran's military negotiator soami in his first uh uh Administration uh we're in a situation that is I think we discussed in the last episode with Nema the United States cannot win militarily because it doesn't have an army and without an army you can't invade a country uh it can't win economically because of its neoliberal policy that have loaded down the economy with NE Financial uh burden uh it doesn't have an army it doesn't even have the arms it's used them all up uh not only its own arms but NATO's arms uh in Ukraine the only uh weapon that the United States has is Terror and chaos and you've just seen that in Syria so um uh and in the assassination of other people's generals and uh administrators uh this is a kind of terrorism that's been BL uh banned by all diplomacy uh and one consequence of uh the NATO assassination of the Russian general a few days ago is tomorrow at the United Nations the United States is going to uh uh I'm sorry Russia is going to prevent present all the evidence of the biolabs and the germ warfare that the United States was planning uh in Ukraine to use against Russia and presumably other enemies the the research uh intended to find out is there even though Russia's made out of 30 or 40 nationalities all with different genetic backgrounds is there some way some way of uh targeting a a Russian Gene uh this is junk science as much as the junk Warfare ideas of America but uh the uh the general that was killed was pre presenting the whole legal case for America's uh biological Weaponry against other countries that uh is probably the ultimate attack on civilization because it's a it attacks the whole population and that was a that's the Nazi philosophy of the ukrainians all Russian speakers should be killed that's the American philosophy we cannot defeat Russia China Iran and the bricks militarily or economically all we can do is try to wipe them out and if you wipe out a whole continent the uh it's very difficult to prevent the whole of civilization from being wiped out that's the escalation that the United States has made and it's escalation above and beyond the concepts of what used to be civilization itself and then that's why what's happening uh in the next uh few weeks and months uh is is and will the United States attack on civilization succeed and uh will it tear any of America's allies apart will it prompt a reaction what is Russia and China to think when they realize the United States is stopping at nothing to try to destroy us uh at what point do we um band together and respond well there's brick so far the bricks don't have any military uh capacity to respond outside of the Shanghai cooperation organization what what do you think uh China and Russia are talking about as contingent contingency plans against what's happening I have no idea but uh it's obvious from what's Happening that there must such discussions going on and the discussions have to be at what point do we respond not simply uh tip for tap which is what uh the Chinese are officially saying don't escalate uh only do a measured response at which point do they think what are we measuring are we measuring simply an attack uh uh by uh ukrainians or are we measuring an attack of the West the 15% of the population against the whole rest of the world in Civilization itself yeah I I think you're coming to that I think we are moving in that direction I think it's a tragedy beyond words I think the the flash point to tell you the truth right now the are two flash points one is Europe and one is Asia Africa and Latin America because these are the two blocks let's call them for lack of a better word that are uh Expendable for the two major Powers the the bricks China allies on the one hand and the US allies on the other and uh there'll be Temptations look I am sure I don't know this but I am sure as I as sure as I can be without being a part of one of these governments that there are many people in Britain France Germany Italy and across Europe who are wondering not yet out loud but are wondering in every quiet meeting in every panel discussion in every Think Tank conference have the Europeans connected their wagon to the United States at the Historical wrong time to do that should they maybe be more care clearly some of them have reached that conclusion Mr Orban in Hungary is among them and now there are leaders in the Czech Republic and elsewhere who are also wondering and it's not so surprising that there are new Arrangements being made almost every day between for example the leaders of Spain and China the leaders in Greece and China and the look they're right the West cannot sustain what it once did it's the declining Empire it's not the rising one and they cannot pretend although Mr Sullivan certainly will try that that isn't the case little countries are getting better deals from China than they can get in the west and what is that going to mean what is the lesson being learned and this is not about preferring one kind of society to another it really has very little to do with that the United States is showing not only that it's desperate but it is showing that it is prepared in its desperation to really whack to hit out to in in the desperate ways that uh declining societies often do you know it'll be a struggle in this country it already is here in the United States whether you respond to the growing difficulties by an aggressive look at Mr Trump if you don't do what I say I'm going to tarff you you know he rewrote Mr Trump the NAFTA agreement between Canada Mexico and the United States He rewrote it put pressure on the other two to sign it and they all did that does not allow for him to do what he said last week he's going to do so he's saying I don't care about these International agreements even when I negotiated them I don't care I'm desperate I don't care if you don't do what I want and look at Mr Trudeau he is he is digging Mr Trudeau's political grave as we speak the woman in Mexico has much more of a backbone and is pushing back but Mr Trudeau he may push back soon but his his reaction was to go to Florida and have dinner you know alongside Elon Musk and Jeffrey Bezos and other people looking for favors wow you know what that does that gives Mr Trump a mistaken idea of the power that he has his power isn't the global one he thinks his power is much more circumspect it's the transactional moment in which the people who don't like him at all will go to his dinner and ask for a favor but you know we are watching a declining Empire if if I were to say anything to all of you uh in in a general way about this situation it would be don't lose sight of the biggest picture of all which I believe is a declining American Empire I'm sorry I have to get this a declining American Empire and a um and the consequences of that decline that that is a serious issue and it and it continues to be a serious issue that people like we have to put on the table because the reaction in the United States and in Europe is the denial of all of that there is no decline there is no Empire that that's a denial and there is no declining Empire that's a double denial and so everything has to be rethought roken or to use Michael's term a narrative has to be erected so we can talk to each other without the blindness that we have imposed on ourselves by joining inadvertently in a massive denial and by that I mean what what a psychiatrist means or any medical doctor if you have a physical problem or a mental problem the first step in overcoming it is not to deny that you have it that's your most important first step we have to do that and that has not been done you did not hear a word about a declining Empire neither from Mr Trump nor from kamla Harris throughout the campaign to who going to run the country for the next four years that's a level of denial that is itself pathological I'm so glad you've circled back to Canada and uh Mexico Richard uh yesterday the financial times had a chart of all the major countries in the world and at the very bottom of the list of GDP growth are Canada and Mexico uh the two countries that signed uh the NAFTA agreement beginning under Clinton uh and it was the NAFTA agreement that began the whole commitment of the democratic party to a class war against Labor uh the idea was to Offshore American Labor uh beginning with the maquiladoras in Mexico along the border with the United States they set up all sorts of assembly plants uh and uh Mexicans moved from uh the South and the central Mexico up to the northern uh border uh to begin uh working at the assembly plants to replace American Labor uh in doing this and uh Clinton Then followed up by in uh inviting China into the World Trade Organization in 1998 uh to complete the shift of American industrial labor abroad to China uh this was done in um in alongside uh renegotiation of the Canadian Auto Trade much against uh uh Canada all of the United States uh agreements with Canada have been those of a big bully beating up the small guy uh of of Canada that's why Trump is said in uh and this came up in the interview that Nema quoted at the very beginning the interview said well you know you we've beaten up Canada are are do we have to invade it uh to actually absorb it how are we going to get the Canadian States to join uh the unit uh uh the United States uh and if we do that will Canada join as just one State uh with the same vote as say Ro little Rhode Island or will there be a number of states and are these states going to vote Democratic or republican I think Trump's serious in absorbing Canada and the fact is that ever since the original Auto Trade Agreement uh and certainly NAFTA the United States has been absorbing uh Canada into the US economy the results have not been good for Canada as an American partner same thing in Mexico the NAFTA agreement uh because it was a Free Trade Agreement flooded Mexico's agricultural markets with low priced subsidized American grain uh ending the prosperity of the Mexican Farmers who've been uh growing it well what's going to happen well the current uh Mexican president you've noted out not uh noted is uh trying to recover Mexican economy from uh the world's uh lowest uh growing major country uh as a result of its unfortunate proximity to the United States by making agreements with China and that trade with China is uh rising to replace that of the United States and it's not simply a export competition between us exporters and uh American exporters it's uh the uh a different kind of economic relationship between Mexico and China than the uh lose the win lose relationship that Mexico has had with China ever since the I'm sorry that Mexico was had with America ever since the 1990s that's uh really the threat what will happen if China uh and Mexico try to make a win-win situation for both countries benefit uh where where is that going to leave the United States itself well that brings back to the what the interviewer and neema's quotation from uh asked Mr Sullivan you know are you going to invade Canada are going to invade Mexico you know we can see you uh fighting war in a different continent across the oceans uh but what about right here at home uh I I think if other countries look at how the US agreements and negotiations with Canada and Mexico gone that's a analog for how the United States would treat the whole rest of the world under the unipolar hemony that it's trying to impose so I I think uh starting right at home uh on the North American continent itself uh is a a a very interesting uh perspective on how the US plans for the rest of the world uh would play out if the United States gets its way let me only add because we we play this duet Michael and I so let me only add that uh the economic weapons that that Trump is brandishing particularly tariffs uh is accompanied by the deportation maneuver that he's also waging and think of it this way you're depriving Canada and Mexico of a good part of their export Market that is the demand for labor at the same time that you're destabilizing the whole society by importing the forced deportee who is a increase in the supply of labor relocated to Mexico on the one hand and Canada so there'll be more people looking for fewer jobs that's a recipe for political disaster on both borders and it will will it attempt demog goes in the United States to begin to seriously talk about taking over those countries the answer is yes and now it can be done in the name of National Security because of the destabilized just as people today don't want to recognize in the United States that US foreign policy had a lot to do with the movement of central Americans North to the United States so then we will see once again the demagogic oh things are unstable in Mexico as if the United States were merely a spectator rather than an active cause of what's going on there this is a very serious outflow from the problems of the United States becoming externalized as if they were the problems of others we as a nation are good at scapegoating we scapegoat the Chinese we scapegoat the immigrants from the Latin America we will scapegoat turmoil in Mexico and Canada in much the same way because it functions in the same purpose to relieve the United States of the need to deny all that is actually problem ized here which is a declining capitalism which cannot be spoken and so you have to find substitute problems to focus everyone's attention on it's not a sign of intellectual maturity but it is unfortunately a politically popular way to move this conversation forward and Mr Trump clearly Embraces this method that's how he won the election without the deportation of immigrants and without the inflicting of tariffs those were his two major issues he rode that horse over and over again right into the White House y just before wrapping up this session Richard and Michael don't how do you find this situation in s because we we see a group of Isis that everybody knows what's the mission on their part and what's the mentality of these people and it seems that the Biden Administration together with Nao they're thinking that out of these people they can bring something good to the region or maybe the fall of Assad would be better for Isel I would argue even in a long run it doesn't is is it's not going to benefit Israel but it seems in the short term n sees this as a political victory for for him and for his position in Israel well you've already seen uh apparently the Isis uh the jihadis and galani uh has been uh taking certainly the Christian uh women shooting the husbands in front of them and selling them into slavery into slavery uh this is democracy with an exclamation point uh and the amaz to look at the New York Times The Wall Street Journal and the financial times they say uh all these quotes from syrians who had to flee uh from Assad uh for political reasons they say now we can go back uh to Syria finally they'll go back they'll be met at the airport uh with policemen uh handcuffed sold as sex slaves I mean this this is uh the truly amazing scenario that's going on uh freedom is bondage uh you you cannot get more orwellian uh than all of that and especially the Democratic politicians who were all trying to uh pushing the uh gender identity and the women's rights are celebrating the ma the mass SE seizure of the women uh for sale and assassination of their husbands this is I think the ultimate uh uh I guess we'd call that an internal contradiction in the narrative I also think it's it's a lesson you know Syria has been a divided country for quite some years it's a country that never in a way resolved its Civil War never resolved the conflicts within it that were legacies of colonialism and then all that happened afterwards uh and then it got caught up in the Cold War and it got caught up in the Israeli conflicts uh in the Middle East it's a divided country and nothing is happening that indicates it will not continue to be a Di and I won't let me remind you that most syrians I believe are now in Exile that is most of what was once the population of Syria are immigrants in other parts of the world particularly Europe but but beyond that as well and my guess is given the kinds of events happening now they're not going to go back in large numbers there's too much instability there's too much uncertainty and I don't see that going going away I I see Mr nanaho sees it as an opportunity to solidify the Goan Heights uh maneuver that Israel has been concerned with for many many years uh and everybody else sees it as a playground the Russians may be withdrawing their bases but but as a close Ally of Iran which shares so much with Syria that's going to be a tense border a tense situation for a long time with who knows what kind of outcomes uh and the instability of the Jihadi movement where mean that too will be a conflicted terrain one way or another so it seems to me that this is a a a an unstable turmoil driven situation that isn't about to stop well there's one constant in the kind of diplomatic stability it's all about oil who's going to get the oil that was the original plan of uh Britain and the United States way back World War I and the aftermath of World War I uh they've got to prevent an Arab uh group of countries from controlling uh the world oil trade when the whole key to Industrial power and GDP seemed to be about oil so uh here you have the United States already grabbing uh the oil in uh Syria uh selling it via the curds to uh to Israel Israel wants the war oil and and uh sod Do's uh turkey so I think the the fight is not only going to be about these these different uh groupings uh more than 10 all fighting each other for a political and uh religious and Jihadi uh objectives in Syria it's going to be who gets the oil uh Israel has already say we have the water we've just taken the Big Dam on the Golan Heights we can cut off the water to to Syria and to Jordan if we want and after all the whole near East begin is a water-based irrigation civilization that uh created the whole uh surplus of industrialization in Mesopotamia 5,000 years ago water is still the key there so uh water oil is going to be about natural resources ultimately and that's what uh they're not talking about they're talking about how the syrians are glad to come back uh uh and instead of being enslaved by uh or prosecuted or thrown in jail by uh Assan uh they're going to be enslaved by the jihadis which is uh the United States says this is a much better situation because the jihadis are democracy uh they're wearing suits now and they're are guys they're the people that we've created ever since since uh we set up al-Qaeda in Afghanistan to uh fight against socialism and communism by religious fanaticism uh that that was the original uh fight by the uh Carter Administration and binski uh against the secular society that Afghanistan used to be what happened to Afghanistan is now being repeated uh in Syria uh ex except uh whereas in Afghanistan stand that uh the United States wanted the raw materials and the poppy fields for heroin uh in Syria it's uh it's the oil and the water rer do you want to add something or no I think we have uh we've done a lot today I and my hats off to you Neema you are a very good even if you're lowkey you're a very good um interviewer in the sense you draw us out and
