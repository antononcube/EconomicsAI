today is Thursday October 17th and we're having Richard Wolff and Michael Hudson with us to talk about us foreign policy and the title of this video today Richard and Michael is over the world the end of international law and we know whenever they're talking about the foreign policy of the United States they're talking about the rules based International order and Michael let's start with you how do you find it why is the end of why they have decided to put an end to the international law well you're right that the the buildup of this whole us sponsored aggression from Ukraine to Israel has caused a breakdown of international law and uh just important there's no what does international law mean when there's no means of enforcement uh if there are laws against genocide laws against ongoing attacks on civilian what can anyone do about it uh there seems to be a global war and all of the tactics now are different from all the wars that we've seen before uh and we'll get into that but the the basic political issues today in this new Cold War uh uh very much like Europe's 30 Years War from 16 uh 1618 to 1648 that 30 years war ended with a piece of vestalia and that led to the creation of international law that's ruled the world all the way from 1648 until uh the creation of the United Nations uh and until just a few years ago when the United States replaced it and said uh we are no no longer following international law We are following our own law uh we call it the rules-based order uh and it's our rules and our rules of the of order are the reverse of everything that international law has said uh before it's it's a radical change and hardly anybody's talked about this because what do you do about the fact that you have the United States Ukraine Israel NATO uh all of a sudden reversing the princip that were considered to be the very basis of civilization for almost four centuries now uh the it's very radical the you the the you United States has a unipolar drive for control over uh countries the whole basis of international law after the 30 Years War was to prevent fur future Wars by saying no country can interfere with the political Affairs of other countries uh uh every country has its own autonomy uh and that's what the essentially the war was fought over uh the Catholic countries were attacking uh the Protestant countries and it was the most the largest and most devastating war that Europe had until uh World War I uh but at the end they got together and at the piece of vestalia they said how do we prevent this from happening again well we we're going to recognize all nations are sovereign and no countries as I said permitted to interfere with other countries to bring about regime change uh there was to be religious and political Freedom uh and the world was to be multi-polar they didn't use that word but that meant there wouldn't be any single group dominating them uh and they were referring specifically to the uh the Catholic church and that the hsur monarchy the hsur controlled uh Spain that had all of the silver coming in from the new world and was the big military power uh as was France uh and they were Allied against Germany Sweden and the northern uh European Protestant countries so multi polar a multi-polar world was the whole basis of international law and uh that that was supposed to be the basis of the United Nations and violation of these princip principles was viewed as if it was attack on civilization itself Emanuel Kant and other German philosophers wrote about uh you know how this was finally a universal law and you needed this universal law of individual uh freedom for for persons but also uh for for Nations well all this is now being rejected by the United States uh and its allies uh and the proxy state of Israel uh in the near uh the the world's being separated into blocks between the east and west and the conflict today really is whether the Eastern Nations the bricks Russia China Iran and the Allies that they've been putting together are going to be able to design their own destiny or whether they're going to have to be subject to whatever the United States does and uh you've seen in the last few days in Ukraine uh the the nonresident zalinski uh has just said we're going to raise the money uh to buy arms and to uh bribe all of our officials to be loyal by selling off uh Ukraine's titanium uh mines to to sill off the natural resources so even if Russia takes over uh the international law that America supports is going to say wait a minute we've already privatized all these resources uh yes you can take them over Russia but you won't have any control over the land or your ability to tax them because we've privatized it all that's the kind of uh transformation of uh the way the world is organized that nobody could have expected uh before uh so there's a a kind of ideological Inquisition uh that that's taking place uh throughout the world uh by the United States that rejects the most basic principles of national sovereignty and we're what's so remarkable in this is we're seeing an economically shrinking and de-industrializing the United States and Europe trying to prevent the global majority from aiming at its own economic and political Independence uh the rest of the world has 85% of the world's population and it's trying to uh recover from over a century of colonialism uh and the financial neocolonialism that the United States put in place after 1945 the US centered rules of international trade and investment uh that sort of forced other countries to supply raw materials instead of industrializing and feeding their own population and their own economies and raising their own living standards so you have this us NATO golden billion waging this new Cold War against most of the western world uh without uh without an army really to enforce it it's policy makers have uh followed an entirely different track than than was done before uh it's they deem other countries uh and adversaries to uh be a different civilization altogether and I'll get to to that uh shortly uh it's it's trying to dominate the world but at no longer has the military dominance that it had in 1945 it's lost its former ability to dominate the world monetary system uh and by economic means uh its uh aim of retaining its former unipolar uh policy is uh has been replaced by a whole different strategy by uh escalating it all saying it we're we're dealing with the end of civilization and the end of civiliz is supposed to be the United States taking control of the whole world by imposing a neoliberal privatization uh ethic theriz and rizing uh uh the whole the whole world yeah Richard JN let me come at it I I appreciate very much uh Michael's historical framework I think it very helpful uh to keep that that in mind it avoids all kinds of mistakes let me add some comments to the to the story he's told in my view what is going on is a desperate effort of a declining situation A declining regime if you like a declining historical phase that doesn't want to give up which I understand and they don't usually go quietly these Empires when they go down but I think the theory that that you're breaking all the customary rules that were in in place either explicitly or implicitly for several centuries is the right way to look at this and it'll help us understand things that we might not see connected but that are so number one a level of horror in Gaza I want to be clear what was denied by people who could not face what was done to Jews in Europe in the Holocaust right we have the phenomena of people who have to deny it that's a way of recognizing how horrible that thing was that you can't stand it so you you literally erase it it's not the appropriate response one should recognize it but it it helps you underscore just how horrible it was that people have to do that and it underscores in Gaza that the Israelis don't want you to call this a genocide because if you do then the victims of one Holocaust are busily perpetrating another one you know this is horrible and you can't have the United States quite deal with it for a number of reasons number one because Israel is the same settler colonialism that the United States is we are a country of Europeans who come over to the Western Hemisphere and ethnically cleanse the indigenous population out of existence with the exception of the horrible condition the few remaining ones uh live out in the so-called reservations scattered across the United States making their living from gambling casinos and so on just remarkable uh obliteration but United States Canada Australia New Zealand South Africa these are horrible examples of settler colonialism but they were accomplished at a time when that was historically possible Israel has the unfortunate historical fact that it isn't possible anymore and trying to do it now is self-destructive although it may take him a while but let me show you some other ways to connect the international rules were that countries could keep their reserves the backing for their currency in foreign Banks Russia kept a good part of its dollar and gold Holdings in foreign Banks those were seized early on in this war that's a viol to this day there are legal ramifications percolating in Europe even in England questioning for example they couldn't they decided because they're torn too about obliterating existing law so they didn't take that money they they froze it which is already not legal but when it came to giving the money to Ukraine they have decided just to give the interest earned by those stolen funds not the this is a this is a a playing with giving up the rule the idea of the sacran private property of Russia and then you take the interest from it that's stealing too right this is a this is lawyerly games but what's important here is is as Michael says leaving it then there's the war in Ukraine itself okay Ukraine says it needs to have security Russia says it needs to have security Ukraine is is behaving badly towards its Russian minorities the Russian want to protect their minority okay this has to be worked out this is not the first time you've had this kind of a conflict there's nothing unique about that conflict you know there were Germans living in in the Sudan land in Czechoslovakia there were other examples this could have been worked out as those others were but it wasn't and that's what's interesting the decision was made not to now yes it's the United States flexing its muscle but I see it a little bit less grandiosely as Michael put it reshaping the world it is that but it comes out of a defensive posture it comes out of desperation it comes out of we are losing in the world and we want to we will not tolerate losing again you will not stop us from doing what we want to do in Ukraine you will not stop us from having Israel as our secure Outpost you cannot attack it we don't care what your issue is you're Palestinians you were there that's not interesting for us for us is we need a reliable agent in the Middle East Israel has been that and we will Pro we will protect it and we have now controlled Ukraine we rearranged their politics a few years earlier to make that the case it's ours it's part of our expansion of NATO we and the horror is that the Russians should resist that the Russians should say and this has nothing to do with whether the Russians are right or wrong in any of this this is an Empire saying in the words of Lynden Johnson so far and no further you know and good Texas English uh so I see the The Taking of the of the res reserves from Russia I see the misunderstanding of what's going on in terms of Russia's allies the power that the bricks have forget yes it takes time to replace the dollar the bricks have made some moves in that direction but they still have a long way to go no question no question but the reality is the bricks have made real moves and one of the most important was supporting Russia again against the United States in Europe in the Ukraine that's the reality and this not about right or wrong or anything else this is about how you try to handle and understand what's going on the United States is desperate and by the way I want people to see it internally it's not if it were just external I wouldn't be saying these things but it's internal too the reason we have a character like Trump in a position to be president there it is that's a symptom people are so angry with what is happening to their lives here that they want something different and they don't care who he has abused or what he has said or how many times he's gone bankrupt these are details he says he's going to change everything and go back to when it was better that is understood by people whose reality has decreased when production leaves the United States as it has Manufacturing in huge portion has left the United States and moved overseas it took the best jobs it took the strongest unions and decimated them by moving UAW is a shadow of what it once was the same is through of the steel workers and all the rest of them okay that's a reality that means jobs are not what they once were and that means the standard of living isn't what it was and the security of your job isn't what it was and what what was done by the relocation of jobs to profit from from overseas expansion will now be continued with another technological wave this time not the computers and robots this time artificial intelligence which will be used for profit making purposes at the expense of the quality and the quantity of jobs so people are correct the Empire that concentrated production and income growth here is now not here anymore it left and the people understand that they're left behind there is then no mystery my last point the media have been obsessing for several years now with the Democrats over the problem the economy is doing well why do the mass of people answer every public poll with a statement the economy's a disaster the economy's a disaster I'm in a disaster this is not because they're stupid it's not because they aren't educated none of those things it's a different experience people question me the stock market's doing well well 85 to 90% of stocks are owned by 10% of the people they're doing well but the other 90% are spectators about a process of prosperity from which they are excluded and they identify with the shrinking American Empire abroad for them they're they're losing their status as a American worker and they're losing their status as an American in short they're losing and they don't want to continue to lose and no one addresses any of that the Republicans say let's go backward okay that's a fantasy that's not a very good long-term proposal that won't go very he lost a good bit of the benefit of that the first time when he didn't do  if you pardon my Spanish uh to take us back to anything and he's not going to do it in the second term either so what you have is a declining situation and the spectacle of a politics that doesn't neither understand nor have any handle whatsoever on any of it so you're watching a dysfunctional system run by a dysfunctional government I want to remind everyone of what a great St tactician once said are the preconditions for revolution they are two number one that the people in charge don't know how to govern anymore and number two that the mass of people feel that the people at the top can't govern anymore if you have those two conditions met you're G to have a revolution we are getting real close in this country well Richard You Begin by saying discussing what's unique uh in the situation you're in today and you use the word desperation and what you've been describing is desperation uh right along and that indeed is what makes it unique the United States in the west no longer can mount a war of military occupation uh that's another part of the byproduct of what you've been uh describing economically UK Ukraine showed uh that the United States can't win a war and that NATO needs proxy armies because they uh their own population would resist uh if there were a draft so the US and NATO forces have only one policy to use they can only bomb and shoot missiles and the basic political fact remains that they're too weak to win on the battlefield according to the rules of war that formally guided international law and made genocide illegal and I want to focus on this uh the effect of all of what You' described on what it means for international law and the global fracture that we're seeing today I think thei the US and NATO fight to control the world from the Atlantic to the Pacific and from the United States and England all the way to the China Sea can only be one in a dirty way in violation of international law by focusing on killing civilians bombing hospitals schools and other basic institutions that's what makes this war unique US Naval fighting uh concentrates on uh civilian instead of military targets uh you you've seen Iran uh Ukraine focusing on the russian-speaking uh civilian population uh hoping that the civilians will say please don't bomb us anymore uh we we want our own Boris yelson or someone Pinette or some zalinski uh to take over we'll do anything uh for peace but that's not what they did they rallied around Russia and say you know what what's uh you're killing us is wrong and we're not going to submit to you because if you're killing us now what are you going to do uh if there were peace so this is this is genocide in Ukraine just as it's genocide uh in in Israel uh and the IT other countries are uh are seeing that it's a moral evil and it's an attack on the very principle of civilization and common Humanity so what's what is the US and NATO to do they're relying on on Ukraine and Israel Nazis to uh uh upro uh or destroy uh any population that resists at second ecomic or financial and political control or simply in their way it's a it's a war of extermination not a military war against armies but a war of extermination uh of people in order to uh create a neocolonialism that's what the US NATO is doing they are trying to create a a neocolonialism to make one world uh not a a group of different civilizations one civilization that is the US neoliberal civilization and uh other uh countries in their way uh are not really an alternative civilization there's no plurality of civilizations where each can each country or region can make its choice there's only supposed uh support supposed to be one now this is evil uh but it's historically a characteristic of religious wars and they're Wars of hatred and ethnic National and even hatred uh racial hatred in the case of Europe's colonialism and America's war in Asia soldiers and uh even the domestic civilian population is propagandized to view the enemy as being uh subhuman and therefore it can be treated in utterly different way than uh the rules of War uh the that's the character of Israel's war against Islamic countries and against any population that stands in the way of Israel expanding from the sea to the ocean that is all the land and oil and natural resources extending from the Mediterranean Sea to the Indian Ocean that's the aim the the uh the broad West Asian area is to be turned into a land without a people that's what uh that's what Netanyahu means a land without a people just as what Israel settlers did to the Palestinians who lived there from a the occupants are held to be non- people to be treated as the biblical amalo whom the Lord directed his religionists to exterminate along with all their cattle trees and productive resources capable of sustaining life so when Israel goes into Gaza or the West Bank or now into Lebanon uh they're not not simply they're not fighting another Army they're destroying the hospitals they're tearing up the olive trees that take uh 30 to 50 years to develop they're tearing up the infrastructure they're they're making it impossible to continue uh to live there that's what makes this uh unique and even more destructive than uh the earlier Wars uh which at least left the civilization and the basic infrastructure in place but it's destructive because of what you said desperation of the West and the US and Europe it's the only only kind of War they can fight let let me tell you a story even if I've done it once before that I I hope will bring it home to an American audience I once took some European visitors to a town in Massachusetts called Old Deerfield it is a part of a little town called Deerfield located on the Deerfield river in Western Massachusetts the town of old Deerfield is a recreated community that has recreated all the houses in it to look like they did in colonial days before the United States emerged as a independent country if you visit this View Place and you start looking at these interesting old reconstituted houses and you go inside and you see the colonial furniture and all that you will be um uh confronted with little plaques on the outside of each house that give you a little thumbnail description of life when this house was occupied by living family etc etc and I went and I looked at it like like my guests and we all immediately reacted because what it says on the plaques and to my knowledge that's what it says right now as we're speaking it describes the family of Jon Jones and his wife and the children and then on this difficult day back in 1691 the Savages attacked and then periodically it's all about out the Savages who were then eventually beaten back and the Europeans looked at each other and I looked at them and they at me the Europeans arrived here killed these people took their land and called them Savages shot them like animals because the indigenous people didn't have guns and gunpowder and all the rest to that whereas the Europeans did so it was quite easy to shoot them and to deal with them as animals they were Savage when they resisted their land and their animals being taken from them then they became more Savage and absolutely subject to extermination which was considered a 100% AC acceptable social solution the final solution to the Native American problem you might call it but you know again this is not about Europeans or Native Americans it's about settler colonialism that has a problem that's why it has to imagine that the land is empty because otherwise it would be confronted with what are you doing if the land is full well you are creating a them versus us if you read the literature of those who support Netanyahu that's what they say every day it's them or us that's what the colonial people in in Old Deerfield felt it was them or us and they would celebrate the attack of the Savages because it confirmed how Savage they were it didn't confirm that settler colonialism might be questioned that never occurred to them I mean it's a study in what can happen to human beings when they trap themselves or are trapped in a dead end that they don't want to confront well then they rethink it so it isn't a dead end it is isn't a problem it is now understandable as getting rid of these pesty animals that stand in the way of the noble Christian civilization we are constructing and in Israel simply substitute Jewish or Zionist or whatever word you want but we do have to understand that this isn't new Michael is right it is a particular hisor rical conjuncture that's what's fading my fear is if we give it too much of a of um uniqueness you'll miss the fact that it is a rerun look the world looks back on those years 1933 to 1945 12 years long time 12 years Mr Hitler came to power in January of 1933 and he was finished in World War II so from 33 to 45 12 years he the Nazis ruled and the whole world has ever since looked back in horror at what they did and what they were for those 12 years it was scary and people shook their heads and didn't want to believe it and turned away from it but eventually it had it and now it's taken 75 years for right-wing fascistic types to put their heads up above the sand and we see them now again but again it took a long time the Israeli be Behavior will take a long time and we will look back on it the way we look back on what the Nazis did in their part of Europe with the same horror except we will have learned maybe something from this time more than we learned the first time well I think Richard what you're describing is there is something unique today and that is that there's a whole ideology to support uh something that uh support what the settlers did in America and you're quite right to draw that parallel and uh what settler states are doing elsewhere and what the United States and NATO are trying to expand other countries uh it's much more than a class of civilizations like between the uh uh English settlers and uh the domestic uh the domestic indigenous population here it's uh it's more it's an a back on the very principle of what people traditionally have considered to be civilization and I think America's policy makers have come to realize that their plan for World dictatorship that they uh celebrated in 1992 is the end of History by Francis fukiyama has been a failure uh that the uh their idea of uh civilization is everyone will follow Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher and will private I the economy and now that the Soviet Union is dead there is no alternative well uh fian's book was very quickly replaced a year later by a book by his teacher at Harvard Samuel Huntington in The Clash of civilizations and the remaking of the world order and Huntington described uh the real organization uh civilization is US nationalism neoliberalism and its doctrine of a unipolar world that was his definition of civilization is a universal world there's no room other civilizations are uh basically uh how indigenous populations were treated and Huntington warned that the United States uh faced future fights that were not simply uh a move from a different grade and monetary Pol trade and monetary policies by countries seeking to escape from the Legacy of colonialism and US dominance he meant a class of culture and that's that's really the key not to accept us dominance was deemed to be trying to create a new civilization so it wasn't just the fight of the English settlers of America or the Jewish Settlers of Palestine that take land it was a cultural uh civilizational fight that's what uh made it basically uh different for all this and the principle of national self-determination and personal religious and political Freedom used to be considered the basis of civilization obviously uh that was not uh even though it was during the time of the 30 years war that what you're describing was occurring uh in the settlement of America uh but the US neocons treated the idea of policy Independence uh of other countries is all of a sudden a new alien civilization that threatens the entire West the idea that there could be an alternative and that way of framing international relations inverts the whole traditional Universal morality well so did the English settlement of America uh do it and the Spanish settl settlement of America but it was almost a uh not even discussed by the legal theorists it seemed to be outside uh the realm of something that could be discussed in terms of of international law that's what's and that Gap that creation of a new international law justifying subtler colonialism justifying the right of one nation to take over and Destroy another's people and culture as well as just taking their land uh is essentially what uh uh the World War II was fought against the principle of Nazism yeah before if I could Neema to add the way this is spun nowadays I think illustrates what Michael is trying to get us to understand only let me show you the word that The Clash of civilization is a very convenient way here's a second way that is being used to make the same point that one civilization is in favor of of and is roughly the equivalent of democracy whereas the other civilization is the equivalent or equal to authoritarianism this is a wonderful dichotomization because what it allows you to do is to look at China and no matter how many times the Chinese tell you we have two goals by the way they've been saying this for 50 years we have two goals number one to end a 100 Years of humiliation by which they mean colonialism because even though China as a whole never became a colony parts of it did the the cities along the coast were taken over some by the Germans some by the British it was horrible and they they fought the box of rebellion and they were defeated and all the rest the second goal of China was to raise its people out of the worst poverty the world has ever seen two goals not to be humiliated by foreigners and to raise their standard of living basically okay that's what they set out to do and they have been the most successful in doing that in the history of the world if you measure the amount of improvement and the time it took to achieve it by those standards they are a roaring success notice I'm not commenting on their internal civil liberties or a whole lot of other qualities that are another conversation the chin but for the United States it cannot see what they're doing or why they're doing it they don't anymore have the link of a great struggle between capitalism and socialism cuz that really doesn't fit anymore so they have it between democracy and authoritarianism which has no more pull or power of analysis than the old capitalism versus socialism ever did these are ways of handling the rationalization that the United States needs to achieve what for it has become security if you become a world power then security requires you to control the world if you don't want to be worried about the rest of the world and don't be as a world power be a real strong power where the hell you are but the United States has 7 to 800 bases around the country that's the aspirations of a world power and now it has the problem how do you rationalize wanting to be perpetually what no Empire has achieved answer everybody else is a threat to all that is good in the world it is either nonhuman or a real bad civilization or author Arian last point the the irony here which either a Hegel as philosopher or a barold brush uh as a theater writer or a George Carlin as a comedian how you need that level of Brilliance to capture the most authoritarian political structure exists inside every capitalist Corporation the CEO tells everybody else what to do and the people he orders about the employees have absolutely no recall over him whatsoever they don't vote for him they don't approve anything he does if they don't if he doesn't like them they're fired oh my God finding other other societies authoritarian when this is your reality five out of seven days a week for the vast majority of that takes extraordinary ideological discipline because it's hard to be so blind in one area that you can call another area bad names that apply to you this is an extremity and I don't think these cultures can long sustain it and if I'm right then that's another reason for those who run the United States to be very very worried about their situation well then the question is what are we going to do about it what's the outcome going to be uh when the English attacked the Native Americans they didn't have an opportunity to create an alternative all they could do is Retreat uh further and further Westward until they were uh backed into uh reservations or uh what the nais called concentration camps well us pres uh presidents Biden and Donald Trump both have repeatedly design tried to uh Express their great fear that other countries will do what the Native Americans uh and the Palestinians couldn't do that they'd create an alternative and uh that's why they've designated China as America's existential enemy and to prepare for the ground for conquering it they've uh said well that requires weakening Russia and Iran because they're China's two great Military Allies and suppliers of oil uh that the energy that it needs however US foreign policy suffers this from this hugis that it's always had it assumes that foreign countries will have no access response they'll passively surrender like the Native Americans did uh to the settlers or like the Palestinians did when they simply left the country or got killed uh China and Russia have taken the lead in moving to create an alternative world order that uh is going to defend their independence and that's what we've been talking about on this show uh for about a month now they've created a set of alternative organizations to those of the West the Shanghai cooperation organization has become a defensive counterweight to Nato uh and the bricks are creating a full-fledged uh a full spectrum Alliance to achieve uh trade and financial self-reliance independent of the US and NATO block well NATO's for foray into uh Ukraine to try to uh and Russia's ability to survive as a fiscal state has failed Russia's got even stronger and uh Ukraine's NATO back troops are close to Total defeat so the United States has shifted uh its military support to uh its long-term gain of uh aim of gaining control of the world's oil trade for instance well if we can't win on the battlefield Let's uh control uh the key or the key organs of control and its policy here is very similar to the that uh which it followed in Ukraine it's backing Israel to conquer the entire near East starting with the domestic Palestinian population and extending territory to absorb Lebanon Syria Iraq culminating in the long expressed hope that uh they're going to be able to defeat Iran and pull it into greater Israel and control as I said the whole swath of uh oil lands and G graphy from the Mediterranean to the Indian Ocean and uh like Ukraine Israel's military has focused much more on uh the population that's in its way than uh on Military targets that it really doesn't uh doesn't care about that if you can destroy a uh civilization's hospitals uh infrastructure it's it's culture uh it's the basis that holds uh it together politically and culturally then uh you you you don't need to engage in a military war that you're sure to lose well this uh it's this uh focus on attacking civilians and cultural genocide that violates the Civilized World rules of warfare that I talked at uh at the beginning uh the US NATO countries don't have any troops of their own so their target is extended to uh include uh entire populations that well we can bomb them we're not going to fight them all we can do is Bomb them as long as they don't have bombs to fight back and the Palestinians have no bombs and they're not being supported by other Islamic uh countries there's no uh uh religious or ideological support of the countries around the uh the near e Eastern West Asian area uh that are willing to realize that they're all under threat that uh uh this drive for Laban Throne is not simply uh judaic uh Laban Rome for its own po population it's for the Western Laban Rome to control natural resources uh subsoil uh resources oil minerals the land infrastructure uh the concept of Leen real is morphed into uh great control uh of all all of the preconditions of social survival and that's why the Israeli soldiers concentrate on killing children and uh bombing hospitals and schools uh if you kill the children there won't be any population you have to fight in the future Netanyahu and the Israeli cabinet has said that's again uh again that's why we're killing children that's why we're bombing hospitals we don't want the population to survive well that aim is genocide and it's to prevent other peoples and countries from surviving and living to provide an alternative and like Ukraine Israel's promoting uh race hatred to justify its genocide against the Palestinians and Arabs just as uh it calls its adversaries subhuman just as the ukrainians called the Russian speakers cockroaches subhuman uh the Israelis are treating the Arabs as that and that's really what Huntington's class of civilization means in in progress in in in practice there's really only one civilization in his View and the other civilizations are uh are the PE indigenous population in the way of the settlers well this is what this what's this done it's Reviving World War II Nazi ideology of hatred that was so shocking that uh it's driving the whole world into an alliance to defend itself that's what the United States planners didn't realize that countries fear that the genocide in Gaza and Israel's West Bank may be their own fate if the United States uh seeks to prevent them from following their own independence they achieving uh their own self-reliance their own monetary system their own trade their ability to tax American corporations or to find them if they're polluting uh their land uh if if they uh if they deviate from the US neoliberal policies that is the you basically the US new religion uh if other countries try to escape from their dollar debt or the incessant regime change consequences uh they're they're going to end up like the victims of the settlers so we can think of economic settlement of a of a country economic settlement of taking over the rules of a country's trade uh its domestic laws its ability to tax corporations to to control its uh uh oil and mineral resources in its own natural interest and instead of letting American and European firms uh take them over and siphon off all of their output and the economic value of these resources for itself so we're really in a fight for what kind of civilization we're going to have uh and there may be a global fracture but if there is a global fracture between the 15% of the population that's us NATO and the 85% of all the rest of the world the rest the part of the world that is industrialized the part of the world uh that has the natural resources well uh then uh you the fight that we're seeing today this new cold war is really about what civilizations all about uh in in contrast to the US NATO Israeli anti-civilization let me add if I could because I think there's another dimension you get a different Insight if you ask yourself what comes next Israel presumably is concerned about its security that's what it says all the time and I assume that that's part of the story okay if you're a nation worried about your security here's what you what you're doing you're making yourself the absolute enemy of all Arabs and most Muslims by what you are doing which is in case Americans don't know is widely advertised the destruction in Palestine is front page news in every Muslim country on this planet every day so not like the United States this is we our people our co-religionists our brothers and sisters being slaughtered number one so Israel is going to have to deal with however this ends whenever it ends with a level of global isolation and enmity that is going to be expressed in a million big decisions little decisions and medium decisions made by hundreds of Millions bli millions of people around the world every chance they get it's not just the hooes who figured out how they can strike a blow everybody else number two and probably more important this effort is destroying the Israeli economy they will be dependent on on the United States totally utterly for many many years if not indefinitely they will have no independence from the United States it won't just be a question of needing weapons all the time but needing cash infusions trade deals you name it they're going to need it and the United States with whatever regimes come to power in the United States will hold all the strings in short Israel is creating by its War a level of insecurity dependence uncertainty that will haunt that Society in definitely into the future this is not a strategy that gets them either security nor Independence it is a joke and it's not a funny joke it's a joke on them by telling themselves it's us us or them by refusing to try to find a way out they are creating they're painting themselves into an international political ideological corner they are going to be desperate for a long long time well I think that Israel is only uh the one of the first Arenas in this large uh International fight the United States hasn't said uh the Palestinians are our existential enemy uh they notice that the other Islamic countries are supporting Israel turkey is supporting Israel Saudi Arabia supporting Israel uh Egypt is especially supporting Israel uh they're not fighting against it because the uh the leaders are essentially uh bought off and are are making money by supporting Israel and they're putting the benefit of their own leaders over uh their whole National Destiny I'm more concerned about what's going what other countries are going to do that uh will be able to mount a much stronger response than the near Eastern countries are doing and uh uh essentially uh the response is going to be something that the uh the neare Eastern uh oil countries haven't done uh the C the bricks are moving to decouple from the West in order to create their their own multi-polar world of mutual benefit and uh development and this is the same issue that was fought over in the 30 Years War the problem is that there there seems little chance of the West accepting a piece of West failure uh permitting such a world or at least a world that the United States Europe and Israel uh would want to be a part of that's the difference at least at the end of the 30 Years War uh Europe uh did accept a common interest in ending war and establishing uh we don't want war to dis uh to tear our civilization if you can call it that uh apart uh that's not not uh the case today the United States policy is to tear other countries uh resisting American policy apart saying they're not only a different civilization they're actually a different species each civilization is a species and somehow we're back into the ethnic racial stereotyping uh that underlay the settler colonialism and uh the American wars in Asia Vietnam uh Korea everywhere else and the uh the problem is that uh there's they're not interested in mutual gain they're not interested in a world where everybody can live peacefully together they're they're that's why there's not going to be a two-state solution to Israel uh at all uh the all the uh us want uh wants is the ability to use its brute power to to control and grab whatever resources and revenue uh it wants and the aim is Conquest without regard for the economic cost and benefit so you can't look at and say well what's in the economic interest of the United States and Europe uh isn't their economic interest to join with uh uh Russia and China and all have uh a prosperous world for Mutual gain if leaders say no we don't care we're willing the German leaders are willing to sacrifice the German economy to destroy its industry to shrink its uh GDP quarter after quarter after quarter to reduce its living standards all because that's the price of preventing an alternative world order to uh what the United States which supports us uh is interested in um uh Andre martinov has suggested that the United States is forcing is fighting uh today's World War uh the closing world uh years of World War I uh in the sense that it's fighting over the principles uh the all all of that was about uh about what kind of international relations are going to be established and it's a fight against all other peoples as if it were a struggle for survival between different species a kind of darwinian survival of the fittest and yet the West is now the least economically fit and the least militarily fit except for its Atomic weapons and uh there it's it's a tie because both the US and Russia and China all have the power to blow up the whole world and start again with a new uh Paleolithic Age so this fight treats populations that seek their own policy Independence uh is is a species to be exterminated uh that seems that's the essence of Nazi ideology and it's being repeated today so if there is a clash of civilization where does all this leave the United Nations all the countries except the US NATO and Israel want peace but the United Nations is powerless to ex to exclude the most genocidal violators of international law when Israel backs uh uh blocks humanitarian United Nations emergency food from uh the being delivered to the starving victims of Gaza the United Nations has no military power to just overcome Israel's blockage it doesn't have its own tanks to just say you won't let the the our trucks in we're going to send the trucks in behind a convoy of tanks and if if your Israeli guards block us we're just going to shoot you down it doesn't have any power like that Egypt has the power but it it uh the Americans manipulated the Arab string to put in uh The Chosen successor to Mubarak the dictator uh and has put in place an entirely corrupt Egyptian ruling class uh and the only question is whether the Army uh somehow is going to have an A Memory of Abdul Nasser uh that it doesn't have to be this way so far there's no sign that Egypt will not be an applaud of Israel and a backer of Israel as it's been right now it's not going to help deliver food Aid it's it it's put up just the opposite it puts up blocks saying we don't want any Palestinians here we want them to be starved instead of coming into uh to Egypt uh that is utterly contemptible uh the for I don't think that Arenas further Eastward uh around China Russia Central Asia South Asia are going to be anywhere near is passive and corrupt uh as you've seen uh in the Atlantic uh the Islamic States you can see that they uh they are working very rapidly uh to create an alternative in which the Islamic countries basically have no interest in at all uh uh in joining they they're trying to play it both ways just as turkey is trying to say well uh we're going to be part of NATO but at the same time we're going to be part of bricks uh as the Chinese say a man who tries to take two roads at once is going to have a broken hip joint uh that's basically what we have there so uh if the United States cannot even admit Palestine as a member uh what on Earth can it do it it was the United Nations that created Israel and it itself Bears the responsibility for recognizing Israel and endorsing its explicit aim of genocide against Palestinians from the new settler country's Inception in 8 1948 the United States I'm sorry the United Nations accepted the settler State even as the uh the stern gang was killing all the Palestinians to uh to let its uh its Zionist followers come in and uh the United Nations was powerless to stop it and the United Nations is powerless to act in the very way it's constructed with a security Council that can be blocked by the United States uh and where you can have votes to condemn Israel by the uh uh the only two countries opposing are the United States Israel and a few Pacific island countries uh the whole rest of the world is against them and cannot do anything it's obvious that if there is going to be any way of preventing what we're describing this attack on civilization there has to be a new alternative to the United Nations uh and that alternative has to have a military enforcement law arm of inter interational law and it has to uh realize that this is an existential issue that requires its own ideological Doctrine uh to be Spilled Out what the principles are and how these principles are going to be uh de defended that's what is not I don't see any sign of that happening right now uh the US uh United Nations officials T the paper over this problem by expressing the fantasy that somehow well we really want a two-state solution but we're not going to recognize Palestine and uh we're not going to do anything at all about uh Israel's genocide we're not going to order uh the intern the arrest we're not going to isolate Israel we're going to let a trade with Israel we're going to accept Israel genocide because it has its own freedom to do uh whatever want so the United Nations has essentially become an arm of the US state department uh and Military and uh that's uh uh an impossible way to survive if there's going to be an alternative uh to the US kind of order that we've uh been talking about well president Netanyahu claims that uh the essence of Judaism itself uh is to e exterminate the non-jewish population there UHC and he says that to protest against genocide to claim that the Palestinians are people and should not be killed is anti-Semitic because Israel is a Jewish state and its settlers may suffer retaliation if as they kill the indigenous population and be uh they and because they've killed so many Palestinians it's only natural that the the uh Palestinians and Arabs would want to fight back and it's that reality that they want to defend themselves that is as you've just said uh uh is an existential threat to Israel uh and so uh any country that fights back against uh the attacks that are being bombed by the United States B the the United States bombs that Israel uh is dropping uh is in anti-semitic and Germany and the United States have passed laws that uh any support of the Palestinian any claim that they are human beings any demonstrations on campus any political demonstrations uh are legally uh breaking the law that's what's so contemptible uh certainly about Germany uh but also about the United States and the other NATO Nations we're talking about uh an ideology that is anti- civilizational in principle uh and the remnants uh I all of this is uh we don't have to reinvent the wheel because this was uh the wheel was basically already invented uh in many ways uh after the 30 Years War and that became I think the basis for German philosophy and the whole European Philosophy of Law uh they're they're trying to re reinvent it uh but international law means and names of enforcement and uh uh as long as you have the United Nations subject to veto power you can't do anything so uh the the principles of uh United Nations are pretty clear uh they have to have the principles of the aims should be similar to those of 1648 aiming to end uh the uh opportunities by America's neoliberal Inquisition to interfere with the policies of other nations um the nation of Georgia has recently made positive start in all of this they've closed down the NGS that are being financed by the US uh National Endowment for democracy that is fascism uh to promote regime change uh and to meddle in the internal politics of countries uh in the hope of creating a local Boris yelson or zalinski or sha the uh the national indul for democracy wants to make Georgia into another Ukraine fighting to the last Georgia if they can put in some us puppet that's willing to go to war with Russia so here's the problem that has to be addressed the West has to go beyond uh the idea of a clash of civilization it's it's gone beyond uh this idea of a clash of civilization it wants to be the only civilization left intact but it's uncivilized so it's ideology of destroying countries moving to resist its political and economic Conquest uh is the opposition of uh civilization it's barbarism uh so instead of having a clash of civilization or nations as in the Europe's 30 Years War were experiencing a war against civilization itself and the great question is whether the global majority of uh civilization is going to realize how truly existential America's fight to reverse the principles of civil ization is for these other countries and the most immediate short-term test is going to be America's sponsorship of Israel's fight against Iran uh I think what is what appeared in the 1990s to be the end of civilization is a war of survival for countries seeking to withdraw from the US NATO orbit and uh this us is Israeli Ukrainian policy of dehumanizing the enemy uh is a military tactic going uh way back to Biblical times as we've discussed uh what Israel calls amalec and the US diplomacy calls autocracy uh or socialism uh Russia's President Putin regrets now how gullible he was in believing that the West would somehow act in a way to avoid war in Ukraine because that was in the West's interest uh it was in Europe's interest to uh import Russian oil that was the basis of its industry uh and yet it didn't do that uh us officials never had any intention of keeping their promise not to expand NATO Eastward uh and likewise Iran's newly elected president regrets how gullible he was in uh believing that if Iran refrained from defending its country against Israel bombing and assassinating its officials the West would uh remove or at least lighten the trade and financial sanctions against Iran that didn't happen so now he's hardened his position so where do the big question is where does this leave Chinese foreign policy since America says China's America's existential enemy it's based on offering a win-win agreement that would benefit both countries for international gain but the US leaders have no intention in that kind of policy because it doesn't want anyone else to have the gains uh that are to be made from technological and economic progress they have only one goal unipolar control of the entire planet and its governments its economies its natural resources it's land and its water uh and as in a religious War they're willing to die for the ideal and to bring all the world down in an atomic war if they fail that's what's being threatened in Ukraine today and uh in uh Israel and Iran uh this week racher do you want to I think yeah one of the questions that a lot of people have about all of this is why governments particularly in Europe but also governments elsewhere remain most of them unwilling to challenge what the United States is doing uh you have the hooes they do but they're not even a government they are a part of Yemen but they're not the Yemen is one thing and the hutis are a community within Yemen but you have to look long and far where else you get people willing to do stuff I understand much is done hidden that we don't know about or we can't measure or we can't see so I want to address if I can in the time we have have 10 minutes Richard sorry we have 10 minutes okay why it would be that Olaf Schultz in Germany or Emanuel mcro in France or the EU leadership uh and on and on and on and on are willing as Michael correctly says and as many have pointed out to go along with the United States um in Ukraine and I mean go along uh condemn Russia as the total evil here Supply weapons Supply money uh all the rest of it to the ukrainians uh why they basically go along with Israel in the Middle East uh some more some less I understand but why are they doing it and then people ask well why would um Sweden and Finland join NATO why why is that happening why why even when the German uh Germany is in recession I believe last quarter and this quarter they came in below zero in GDP growth so they are that qualifies two quarters in a row below zero you're in an official recession at least by the usual uh standard of that measure um so here's here's my answer for the last 75 years of United States dominance coming out of World War II any government that the United States found in power anywhere in the world but particularly in Europe that wasn't aligned with American objectives was considered unacceptable um in the beginning for example coming out of World War II just to remind people since the history of this is so poorly known uh the first post World War II government in France had several members of the French Communist Party in the cabinet of uh Charles the go okay uh that meant that the United States had to deal with a government of France a member of the security Council of the United Nations which had Communist party which at that time was very Pro Soviet sitting in the cabinet uh the second largest political party for 20 years after World War II was over in Italy was the Italian Communist party was was the largest Communist Party outside of Russia anywhere in the world so you developed in Europe in places like Germany France Italy everywhere even Britain you you had a version of what in the United States was called McCarthyism it it wasn't as bad as the United States you couldn't you couldn't do to the communist and socialist parties there what you were able to do in the United States that's because of particular historical cultural differences between them but you were able to shut them down what you were able to do was to create a situation in which the heights of political power the dominant role in in the major political parties was people who were acceptable to the United States okay and this became so routine and so normal that you didn't have to impose it anymore from the outside it was understood inside people who sided with the United States saw their careers much more smoothly Upward Bound than people who had the tarity not to go in that direction and there's one after another in every one of these countries that learned that so now we get to the present what you have are dominant political structures overwhelmingly populated by people who have decided from their own experience that going with the United States is the way to go and going against the United States is a recipe for defeat for decline for disaster they're not unaware of what the Russians and the Chinese are doing but they're not yet convinced that the United States won't be able to impose on those others what they have so successfully imposed on the Europeans Olaf Schultz can't think outside that box neither can Mr makron neither can Eric uh stoltenberg or any Joseph Burell any of the other leading figures in European politics and that's true from Scandinavia to to Greece and from England uh to the central European countries that's how they see the world the effort of the Soviet Union let's remember was shown not to be up to the task by the reversals of 1989 1990 1991 and the place where that hasn't happened the Far East is far away from Europe so here's what's going on the Europeans the leadership has decided to go with the United States that's the horse they're betting on to win the race because it always has but they are very worried more now than ever that they may have bet on the wrong horse right below the surface in European politics is a movement part ly on the right that's the rise of all the Quasi fascist the government in Italy the uh aanan in Germany uh Marina Leen in uh France but also on the left with the arrival of of SAR vagen KES in Germany very clear on her position against the war in Ukraine uh Jean luk melona in France who now is the head of the largest political party in the ger in the French assemblé national is is a Marxist I mean and so is VAR Sara vagan can have been Marxist on the left all of their political lives uh and they're known as such in their countries very clearly okay I think you're going to see very disturbing to the United States in the months and years ahead you're going to see eruptions of difference you're going to see emergence of more governments like those of Mr Orban on the right in Hungary uh the Czech government and others that are going to be less and less sure the that's why the United States is desperate that's part of why Israel is desperate they are now convinced that time is not on their side they're frightened they won't say so but that and they're right to be frightened because they're allies in Europe the ones they still count on even though they're disrespectful of them but they are convinced they need them and they do and they do it's very important people understand Europe is in a terrible terrible situation and the Europeans kind of know it they're caught between the United States and Ja and China it's not clear what place for Europe will emerge in this new bricks versus G7 in the G7 Europe is a footnote in the G7 versus China Europe is even more of a footnote Europe is not used to being a footnote Europe is used to being in charge they have a hard road to go how to manage all of this it's going to be tural it's going to be turmoil inside Europe now for a long time and it's going to be rough and difficult and one of the things that may emerge is an attempt either to make a real third third player in the world out of Europe with its own Army its own nuclear its own all that or or to join with bricks and China and go after a multipolarity in which the Europeans by getting in on it have a place they won't have if they don't get in on it these are real existential conditions that are going to be fought out over the next period and and the horror of much of it is that and here I want to take off my hat to you Nima for making these conversations happen this is what has to be talked about if you believe Allah Aristotle and Plato that the unexamined life is not worth living if you think it's better to understand what's happening to you than not to to want to know the good the the bad the risks the hopes then these are the conversations that have to H have to happen and the mainstream media keeps as far away from them as it is possible to be and people like you and these programs are therefore crucial it's not a question about agreeing with what I say or with what Michael says it's not it's important to have these questions opened up to ha to have to contend with the history that Michael reviewed with us and for us today to have to contend with what that points to rather than living in a make-believe world in which a class of civilizations is going on so you don't have to face the real issues that are going to shape what happens to us all well President Putin said a few months ago that uh someday uh Russia and Germany and Europe will trade again but it may take 30 years that's right and my here's my guess from the little I know and it isn't much but from I speak German I read German you know so I'm I'm able to access what goes on in that country I can assure you whatever else it'll be less than 30 years inside Germany is an enormous conversation and debate going on about these issues with much more blunt honesty than we imagine here in the United States just like you have to say inside Israel there's more opposition to what Netanyahu is doing than we have allowed here in the United States it's the irony they have a newspaper they have access they can actually have I'm not saying it's adequate and I'm not denying what Israel is basically doing not for a minute but there is an opposition that the Israelis have mounted to the policy of their government we shouldn't forget that and that these political winds can can change Israel is not let me say this to my American audience it's not winning in in Gaza it's not winning in Lebanon is not it may it may win I'm open I understand but not yet and well you know a year into Hamas and there's still a Hamas after what you've done that's amazing I ask my fellow Americans if in this country one of our 50 States was subjected to the kind of Destruction that Israel has done in Gaza would there be a strong resistance don't answer so quickly because the truth is we don't know but in Israel we do know there is a Hamas they're still fighting back that's amazing and in the long run that's going to be just as important as it turned out after the end of World War I when we all learned about the Norwegian resistance and the French resist resistance and the Italian partisans turned out that there were opponents to the Nazis in every country including Germany yeah well I do write a monthly column for the German uh Financial press of duts so you're right there is a resistance I don't know if you if you've learned that CNN reported that Joe Biden GNA be in Germany to receive Germany's highest award yes that we see that's Mr Schultz trying to play you know we are on your side don't worry we are loyal we are we are you help me get here so I'm gonna help you get there absolutely by the way same relationship between Biden and Netanyahu yeah thank you so much for being with us today raach and Michael see you soon bye- bye by
