when you look at the UN as International institution how do you see its functionality what they're not capable of bringing these superpowers together instead those presidents come at the UN give some Po and go away and everything it seems that it it doesn't work for everybody it doesn't work for the people why the functionality of these institutions are going weaker and weaker in your opinion in my opinion it has to do with the underlying uh phenomena that Carl Marx called uneven development Marx had an interesting idea the way he analyzed capitalism it did not develop evenly where it got going it built up its wealth there leaving the rest of the area behind that's why if you go to Brazil or you go to Nigeria or you go to Europe you will see in the big cities tremendous wealth and people gathered who who go have fancy apartments and eat in expensive restaurants and all of that but you got you dive five miles in any direction and you can see people who have no car who barely get by with enough food whose house is a Shack or falling down you know in Brazil the AV all of that and you have the same with countries Western Europe North America and Japan very very rich most of Asia Africa and and Latin America very very poor and that hasn't changed in many ways it's gotten worse inside countries it's gotten much worse among countries it's a little depends on whether you count China or not if CH China was a very poor country 40 years ago one of the poorest in the world today it has it has achieved an economic Miracle there is no example in human history of people in this short a time 30 40 years going as far from poor towards if not rich comfortable as you have in China but if you take China out for a minute then the the the inequality of the world has not changed very much capitalism reproduces inequality the people who like capitalism celebrate its production and reproduction of wealth true enough but what they don't admit is that capitalism is equally successful in producing and reproducing poverty therefore the honest way to describe capitalism is that it is not an agent y or a means or a social organization to overcome inequality no capitalism reproduces maintains inequality look I live in New York City I live five miles from the richest place on Earth but in another direction if I go five miles I can show you some of the worst poverty in the world that's called uneven development and what happens is when you sign an international treaty a peace treaty a trading agreement an investment agreement a currency agreement you're making an agreement when the world is divided between these rich areas and those poor ones well because capitalism develops unevenly what what may happen is that over time this rich country becomes less rich and another one becomes more Rich you still have the same inequality but it's it's organized differently the country that that was rich before but becomes less so now I'll give you an example uh Britain Britain was the center of global wealth Britain is now much poorer than it used to be relative to the United States or France or Italy or Germany but the British want to hold on to the political power situation of 50 years ago Britain doesn't belong on the security Council of the United Nations is not important enough not militarily not politically and not economically that Britain should beond the security Council and India and CH India not is crazy it's crazy because India was very poor 50 years ago but has become an important country in the world with a population I don't know uh 10 times that of Britain or more so it it and so now you have people who want to change everything because they did well versus those who don't want to change anything because if there's a change they're going to be put down because they haven't grown for me that's why International treaties are broken and that's why the United Nations which was put together under the conditions at the end of World War II remember the end of World War II Japan and Germany are losers they're not on the security Council but those Germany is the largest exporting economy in the world right Japan is an economic Powerhouse but they're not on the security Council instead you know of the five nations you have most you know us Western Europe and China that's it you know Russia but these are completely you know make no sense and I think what you're seeing is that United Nations doesn't get much done because the five left over from World War II the five members of the security Council can and do stop anything from happening with their veto power that they don't want but a small country that doesn't want something cannot doeses not have that power they resent that they're more people are affected by by what they can't do then are affected by what the old powers do do and when you add to that that CH China and India together each have nearly one and a half billion people much larger population than the security Council Members other than China then they're angry they they don't have the political weight that their economic uh growth has in their minds come to so they they're they're blocking each other you can see it uh the US and Western Europe could not get a majority of the United Nations to support their position on Ukraine they couldn't get it done they either voted with Russians or they abstained didn't vote at all but that's a loss for the the United States used to be able to control all of that it's the same reason why uh you're seeing country after country signing Economic Development agreements with China or even with India now because they it's easier to get a loan from China than it is from New York it's easier to get a railroad built by the Chinese than it is to get a railroad built by The Americans every poor country in the world and that's most of the countries can now approach one of two possibilities before they had to go to the west to the United States western Europe Japan they can still do that but they can also go to China and India and take whoever gives them the better deal and this changes everything and I think what you're seeing is everybody is trying to figure out how best to adjust to this fast changing World economy and while they're figuring that out they don't want to make a mistake and make a decision they will regret later so the UN becomes a place where you go and give a speech but other than that the real dealing is done outside there you know dealing is done among the bricks Nations how to develop bricks dealing is done among the G7 how to react to the bricks all of that but the UN where everybody gets together they don't trust each other they don't you know those that are out believe they shouldn't be those that are in want to hold on even though they know they shouldn't this is a mess a mess and it produces inactivity Richard we know that Putin and she didn't participate in G20 now they're having a forum in China and Putin was invited and he's going to be there in October and it it's called Road and bu Forum how important is this in your opinion well I think this is the same issue I mentioned before it's called the belon road initiative it's been going now for I don't know exactly but I I'm I'm guessing now at least 10 years so this is not new um this is an attempt by China with its allies to develop their own Global Supply chains their own ability to move raw materials finished product people uh from the land mass of Asia to the land mass of Europe with connectors to other parts of the world as well but this is this is the Aral of China and the bricks to be a a a global Force remember up until now the world economy has been overwhelmingly shaped and controlled by the west by Western Europe North America and Japan they decided what to trade how to trade it where to trade it whether to use boats or Overland or airplanes or everything is decided by the west and th those decisions that are made and I mean decisions like are we going to invest in railroads or in shipping are we going to build a harbor there or there are we going to build storage facilities ities over here or over there uh all of those decisions were made by Western Banks Western corporations and Western po politicians working with Western Banks and Western governments and so on they don't want that this is not what's best for them for them given the products they're going to need to export and the products they're going to need to import to maximize the profitability of the Chinese development path they need to be able to make these decisions and what they saw because they've said this what they saw was opposition at every point you know if you got a loan from A bank to build a project somewhere let's say in Pakistan then you might have a problem because the Pakistani government is is in a struggle with the Indian government and for that struggle they don't want that railroad there they want it over I we don't want the Chinese what is this we are having to live with the costs to us imposed by the fact that these key decisions are being made by other people who are seeking to optimize other economic opportunities and they don't want it anymore and they they found out if you have a bank loan then the government will stop you okay now you spend four years and pay a lot of lawyers to get the government to change the position and let you do it then you discover when you go to the bank they're not going to give you the loan anymore this is how business works it's not peculiar to the Bel and Road this is not peculiar to China this is how the game is played and the Chinese know it and what are they going to do they don't want to suffer in their Economic Development look that's why China is as powerful as it is because they undertook an economic development they determined it's the it's the good side of having never been a colony China was never a colony so the British didn't build railroads there if there were going to be railroads in China the Chinese had a powerful they might have borrowed British money they might have hired British companies but they kept the decisions in the hands of Indians okay that's what they want now and they they made the decision that they will be best able to do that if they are the core country in an initiative that involves many countries and the bribe it gives is it basically is what I imagine that the Chinese ambassador to Al pic Afghanistan sits down with the foreign minister of Afghanistan and says if you work with us we will defer to you where the belt and Road initiative goes in Afghanistan you will decide how it is built when it is built how you will make decisions on who can move their rail cars Across The Rail lines when you will have a a seat at the table you will have influence if you don't go with us you're going to go with the European company and they're going to do whatever they want and you're not going to be able to do much about it because that's and and they all know this because this has been their reality for the last 150 years 200 years so look will the bricks keep their word I don't know nobody knows but for the first time there's an option and countries look Greece is a member of the Belin Road uh and other countries you might not have thought of because they needed the Bel and Road had to declare what port in the Mediterranean SE will be the port of arrival for Chinese exports and imports all right I don't know if you know it but that Port is the port of pus pus is the closest city to Athens it's a Greek city on the o on the mediterranian and that's where China is building up it's that is spectacularly important for Greece Greece is a poor country in Europe it desperately and the Chinese are pouring huge amounts of money to build a super modern Port where they're going to bring in everything they're going to be selling to to Europe okay these kinds of decisions are going to be made by a project that's how China set it up they didn't set it up as only China they set it up as a coalition if you like a Consortium of different countries and projects all fitting together and it made a certain sense because what what you get out of a railroad in Afghanistan depends a little bit on where the railroads in neighboring Pakistan or Iran where where are they so you need coordinate much more rational to coordinate you'll get more development that way than if you have China doing it by itself a little bit like what happened with colonialism you could have developed Africa much better if there hadn't been the competition of the Spanish Empire the Portuguese Empire the German Empire the French Empire the Belgian Empire the British Empire it's crazy it was just crazy each one making their own decisions without any kind of relationship with the other waste of money waste of resources you know this the Chinese would like to avoid whether they will or not who knows whether they will end up copying Western colonialism which is an accusation already made against the Chinese uh our treasury secretary Janet yelen went to Africa and made speeches where she warned African leaders to beware of Chinese Colonial Ambitions I mean the humor of that was not lost on these leaders who enjoyed telling Janet yelen the only only person who's ever treated us in the way you describe is the West you're telling us to beware that the East might do what we know you do so this not a very effective way of persuading us you know it was silly stupid what she did and I know her personally and I my only excuse is that she probably had to read what somebody else in the bureaucracy wrote uh cuz she knows better than than what that's just junk that unfortunately she agrees to speak
