so nice to have you back Richard thank you very much Nema glad to be here let's get started with the latest discussion or we can call it some sort of talk between Jeffrey saaks and John mimer in which they had some sort of difference when it came to China because whenever they were talking about Middle East or even in Ukraine they were totally in line with each other but when it came to China two different opinion Jeffrey saxs was in favor of having understanding China and getting along with China and John Mir shimer in favor of containing China even militarily what's your take yeah well you know [Music] um I admire John Mir shimer I think he is um willing more than most people like him and by that I mean professional political scientists in American universities or or european universities um both in and out of academic work uh policy people and so on in fact partly because there's so much movement between the university and the government that having a critical perspective in the academic world becomes rarer and rarer and I can assure you having spent my life in American universities I know what I am talking about upand cominging young professors across the social sciences think about getting invited to Washington or for that matter overseas to Capitals in other countries as advisers of one kind or another it's very good for your resume it usually pays better than academic life does and and it's full of prestige and recognition in the media so it is very you don't want to say or do anything that would deny you invitations uh very obvious all around us I remember my professors uh in universities I attended I would say a good third of the time they either had just come back from doing some governmental work in Washington or they were preparing to go to do that kind of work they certainly talked in class to us as students because they knew it would impress us that they had been at a meeting of the secretary of defense or they had been etc etc it's very incestuous in a certain way and what it does is it mutes criticism all of that is by way of saying that none of that worked with John mimer this is a independent thinking uh hard noosed you know they call themselves the realist School uh I have no idea what that means or other than a way of putting down other people for being quote unquote unrealistic which is sort of childish but in any case I admire what he has to say and I think he has been a very very good voice on two subjects the war in Ukraine and the war in the Middle East Gaza and Israel he has not shied away from talking about it and his earlier research on the power of the pro-israel lobby in the United States remains absolutely fundamental if anyone wants to understand that issue other than somebody for whom Zionism is a religion that's that's another matter but uh for them no it doesn't do anything for them but but for everybody else this is this helps you understand how and why uh the United States is being drawn into that war um by the Israelis in this case so that was fine when it comes to China look I have no idea he would be the first one to say I think that the so-called containment approach which really comes out of World War II containment was the word I believe credited it to George Kenan Who was the leading U political science Guru uh how how to deal with Russia you were going to contain Russia this was the language which in my view was pure ideological cover and it was cover for the creation of a network of military bases currently numbering somewhere between 700 800 military bases around the world that the United States maintains at enormous expense uh it was said that this was necessary to contain Russia or to contain Communism when that was seen as some sort of Russian maneuver communism as uh the evil ideological master of whatever was being done by the Soviet Union as the home base of this expanding evil empire to quote Ronald Reagan uh and you had to contain this evil empire this language was wonderful because it's language that says the United States establishes military bases for defensive reasons in other words the military bases are like NATO they are a defensive institution they are a defensive expenditure therefore you don't have to ask or answer the question to what extent is all of this the enforcement of the American Empire in my judgment it is at least as much an Empire enforcement mechanism As It Ever Was a defensive mechanism the notion that the United States after World War II was in danger of a war perpetrated by Russia is ridiculous I mean and by the way me shimer would be the first to tell you that Mir shimer understands that Russia in part collapsed in 1989 because it tried to maintain an arms race with a country 10 to 20 times richer than itself it couldn't do it you cannot maintain military parody let alone fight a war a proxy war against the United States in Afghanistan when the country you're fighting against has a GDP 10 times or 20 times yours that's as hopeless as Ukraine defeating Russia that's ridiculous even with the West's support that isn't working out but as a war it's ridiculous because of the imbalance between the two yes I've read the story of David and Goliath and I understand under some weird circumstances you could win if you're little against the big one but that's not the normal outcome the normal outcome is exactly what we're seeing and the United States however had a wonderful defensive story to tell that allowed enormous sums of taxpayer money to be used to pay for an Empire that the private sector wanted but didn't want to pay for so how did the private capitalists get the secure markets for what they sell get the secure origin of inputs they have to bring in food clothing raw materials that have to come from outside the United States many of them crucial can't build a jet engine for example here in the United States without all kinds of components that come outside because we don't have them here this is not a minor matter so the way all of this was worked out was by having a vast story told of endangerment the Russians endanger us that's why I keep repeating right now when the same game is being played again Mr Putin wants to take over Europe there's no EV as M shimer says over and over again there is no evidence that he wants this he sat by when NATO expanded to the Baltic states in the north to Poland to what was Czechoslovakia to Romania he said you can't go beyond here you know not all here he's already given away most of the what was Eastern Europe it's just it but it's the story that a Americans have always and maybe this is the best way to to tell the story Americans have always needed to justify their own behavior by doing what psychologists call projection projecting onto others what they are doing this first cas to me when I visited a little village here in the United States in Massachusetts it has a name Deerfield Deerfield was a little village in colonial America when it was part of Britain and it was populated by the early British who came and settled and where they settled was in Ana area populated by local indigenous tribes of people who had been living here for many centuries I walked through the village which has been reconstructed to look like a Colonial Village so tourists come and look at it that's what I was doing tourist and the little signs that explained each house had in common the following language on such and such a date in 1641 the sa excuse me the Savages attacked us and we defeated them and we hid in the basement and we and then the next house the Savages and I'm saying to myself This Magnificent these people come 3,000 miles across the ocean take the land away from from these people push them away and then refer to them as Savages it's you who are Savage you came you took they didn't come to Europe you came to them you took their land you ate their animals you fished their water I mean who's the Savage did you offer them help no did you offer them some compensation no but they're The Savage United States has this in its DNA it's built in so we are always surrounded by danger by Savages not human beings not other people no no because that would be dangerous because then you know why are we treating them the way so they can't be people they are savages so Mr Putin isn't the leader trying to figure out how to keep his Society together no no no the Savage and we have lots of intelligent people writing articles as if they were psychiatrists for this man giving us thumbnail description I you know it's childish it's very childish behavior immature Behavior anyway if the Russians can't be portrayed as the Savages and I Mia shammer doesn't do that then I'm I hope I'm not being unfair to him but if you're right I didn't pick all that up from the com I didn't look at the whole talk he had with h with Jeffrey Sachs but if he did what you say he did then that would be my guess that that there has to be some enemy and if it isn't the Russians well who then is it right if you're if you're some people you could actually imagine just showing how childish you are that it is the North Koreans you know at that point I realize I'm in the presence of people with whom further argument is pointless but China makes more sense because it's big but you know all I can do is to remind everyone China's number one priority after ma for sure but maybe even before but after ma their priority has to develop themselves to stop being one of the poorest countries on Earth and to become a modern developed economy they have the Chinese have that priority in common with most countries on this planet in Asia Africa Latin America Eastern Europe and you name it okay the difference between China and all those other countries is that China has done a better job of doing that than they have so that China is now a serious economic competitor of the United States the GDP of the United States about $24 trillion the GDP of China 18 nobody else is in the race they are the two horses furthest down the r that's the reality the rest is make believe these are the two and the United States is having a hard time because for a century it had no such competitor the GDP of Russia is one and a half to $2 trillion not 24 there is no economic competition from Russia there never was that's an illusion of the West needing a dangerous enemy to justify its own problems and how it chose to solve them not very admirable Behavior but that that's what we got uh the Chinese are real and so maybe what Mr Mir shimer means if he were here with us and I'd be glad to meet with him if you ever wanted to set that up would be to talk about whether what he means is that China is something that Russia never was and that therefore we ought to sit down to work out with China how we are going to live together I want to remind people that in the history both of the world and of Economics we have often had what are called duopolies that's not a monopoly that's one and it's not an oligopoly that's several it's two it's a duopoly uh for example here in the United States for a long time we basically had two automobile companies General Motors and Ford that was a duopoly and I could give you many other in Industries where things got concentrated not so there was only one for example the American Telephone and Telegraph company AT&T was a monopoly until it was broken up then it was an oligopoly you know six or seven but it could have been a duop with just two it never got to that point the automobile industry did and you know I could go on well we have a United States and China in the past duopolies have sometimes gone to war against one another one of them was then destroyed leaving the other one as a monopoly well it's a little different with the United States and China because we had a monopoly that was the United States the empire then we gradually saw the emergence of a China to become a duopoly and now the question is are they going to go to war and resolve the conflict by going back to one of them one or the other or do we get together to work something out and that has happened sometimes too so it's not outside the realm of possibility but you have to ad admit that you have this issue before you can solve it every solution presumes that we have an agreed sense roughly of what the problem is you know if you join a a self-help organization one of the things you're required to do publicly is to say well I'm joining this organization because I I'm an alcoholic or I'm a this or I have that problem because admitting and facing the problem is necessary to achieving a solution and it certainly is that in in world affairs at this point we have nothing but the United States trying to contain China you know it's laughable the United States has been trying to contain China now for at least two decades probably longer if all of it was understood but at least the last two decades you know and very openly and aggressively under uh trump it began with Obama too but Trump and Biden trade Wars tariff Wars you know the the American Navy in the South China SE suddenly rediscovering the Taiwan issue as if that hadn't been put to bed decades ago it's brought back to life it's not the Chinese Navy here it's not the Chinese Navy protecting the independence of Puerto Rico from the it's we are over there let's remember it Ukraine is on the border of Russia not the border of the United States it's on and and Taiwan is on the border of as part of China and so forth so these are transparent effort and they don't work they never worked China has had a goal as I said earlier to become a richer less poverty stricken country they've been working at it for the last 40 to 50 years nonstop top priority that's what the Communist party wants that's what their government prioritizes and that's the economy they've set up and they've been very successful very very successful every time I say that I get emails from people who are angry at me for supporting authoritarian government I haven't said a word about their government in terms of whether it's authoritarian or not or how authoritarian that's another discussion I'm perfectly willing to have that discussion but I'm not talking I'm not asking anyone to endorse or support or vote for anything about the government of China I'm an economist describing what they have done they have uniquely organized their economy so that it is roughly one half private capitalist Enterprise more or less like Western Europe North America Cana Canada Japan they have the other half of their economy as a state-owned and operated enterprise system more or less like the Soviet Union that's a hybrid it's not like the Soviet Union because it gives an enormous space to private capitalist Enterprise both Chinese and foreign they've allowed American and European and Japanese and Canadian they're all there okay it's hybrid it's not like the United States it's a huge State sector it's not like the Soviet Union huge private sector and then it's Unique because it has a powerful government supervising coordinating and a Communist Party watching it all wow a very interesting way of doing things does it have political consequences of course does it shape their civil liberties and yes yeah we can talk about that's absolutely reasonable to put on the table but it doesn't make go away what has happened in the early 70s the President Nixon and and his secretary of state Henry Kissinger my teacher at Harvard when I was a student went to China because they could see that capitalists from everywhere else in the world were making a big money in China they wanted Americans to have that opportunity too plus American corporations were telling them go over there and open it up for us which they did because that's what they do they're the people who do that for the big corporations they always have Nixon's career is that and Kissinger put a nice academic face on they went there in order to what open China to business which went and to China in large flow ever since in the 70s 80s 90s and the first decade of this Century Corporation after Corporation moved to China because its wages were much lower than here in the United States and because the market was large and growing by comparison in the United States had much higher wages and the market wasn't growing we have in this country what economists call a mature Market okay put whatever nice word you want on it in business school young aspiring business women and men are told if you want to make a good career in business go to where the wages are low and the market is growing and so they all listen got their a and went to China to do all that and they've been doing it there ever since does do does Private capitalism get some of the credit for China's spectacular growth yes of course it does does the public sector run by the government of course it does too they together achieved this incredible economic growth both and it is incredible here's a little statistic I try to mention because it it Ruffles feathers in a way that makes people remember we have no record in the history of the human race comparable to the economic development achieved by the People's Republic of China since their Revolution for everybody who wants to tell me about how communism didn't work I look at them with befuddlement what are you talking about what are you talk do you mean that what was in Russia isn't there anymore and failed then my response is they call it socialism not com communism USSR stands for Union of so socialist republics they wouldn't have picked that name if they wanted us to believe it was commun you call it communism they never did and diso the Chinese so what are you talking about and once we can get you over the Absurd nonsense you speak because you're either ignorant about what the story was or you need ideologically to rewrite history communism is the name of the party communism is something the party claims it hopes one day to achieve in some nebulous future we may or may not get to and we can talk about that but we can't talk about what they did as communism because that's not what they were doing they were erecting a socialism China calls it socialism with Chinese characteristics Russians would have answered yes and we have socialism with Russian character and that's fine have no problem with that but what they are reasonably measurable by is what they set themselves out to accomplish did you what was your goal we wanted to become a rich and powerful country what have you achieved we are a rich and powerful country wow and you did that with what with 1.4 million people excuse me billion people you went from one of the poorest countries on Earth to a competitor of the United States and you did it in one generation you know who a a comparable development took centuries in Europe took a least a century and a half in the United States they did it in 40 50 years that's amazing what they did they may have paid a terrible price of all kinds and I'm more than happy to discuss it but communism is a great works no place I can't tell you how many esteemed professors among others I have had to debate who say nonsense like this and they say it with the comfort and the solidity and the casualness of something we really all know sort of with the same Spirit as tomorrow the sun will come up we may not see it because of the clouds but I'm confident the sun will come up and we all nod yeah we're all confident the sun will come up I I find it a wonderful testimony to the power of ideology that the anxiety about socialism and communism handles Itself by having all these people say to one another socialism never works and the and the rest of us look at them in the same way that we look at a candidate for president who is really agitated by the fact that a small dark skinned immigrant Community is eating pets I hope I have not said anything to to offend my fellow Professor Mir shimer whose work I genuinely do admire I have learned from him I appreciate it um with Jeffrey saaks is a little bit different he did Terrible Things in the aftermath of the collapse of the Soviet Union he went over there and um administered an austerity program about which I believe he has now gotten deep deep regrets and I commend him if I'm right if he has those regrets he should that was some terrible terrible things were done there and so now he he he compensates or he offsets by taking a much more Progressive position on these kinds of subjects than he used to Richard when it comes to the conflict in Ukraine we have two military industrial complex fighting each other the Russian military industrial complex which is the Soviet Union military industrial complex still under the control of the government the same way it was before and the other is the military industrial complex of the United State capitalist military industrial complex right and these two are fighting each other and the United States is not capable because of bricks to put with those sanctions to destroy the Russian economy and the economy is working that they can feed the military industrial complex can we say that this even if they in those days with the Soviet Union what was the reason that Soviet Union collapsed it was because of these problems these type of some sort of sanctions or the problem that Soviet Union had within its system well let me respond to several things I think the difference between the uh military industrial complex in the Soviet Union and that in the United States is minimal uh I think they are very similar I think they work in similar ways there is a military uh leadership that um is responsible for mobilizing the Army and Navy and all of that and operating its equipment and assessing and fighting Wars and then there is the private sector which produces the guns and the ships and the planes and the uniforms and all the rest needed by the military each of them needs the other you can't have a military without the production you can't have that production unless they can sell it to the military uh and so they become a military industrial complex and the lines between them become more and more blurry you have people moving Executives from the companies become leaders of the military and vice versa you see that in both societies generals become Executives Executives become military ministers or Deputy ministers all of that this is a merger and it is a phenomena there uh as it is here and that became only that was true before 1989 and is true afterwards um before 1989 it was State Enterprises that had to work out their relationship with the military now it's private Enterprises who work at the relationship in the early years it was the same individuals who had simply changed their uniform and their outfit from civilian to Military and so on or had joined the Communist party or unjoined it as the case may be uh um now as to why the Soviet Union fell well my colleagues Steven Resnik and I wrote a book called uh class Theory and history capitalism and communism in the USSR we wrote that book published it in the year 2002 uh it's been translated into many languages and so on it is the attempt from a Marxist perspective to account for the collapse of the Soviet Union and the reason we wrote that book was because everything we read were accounts of that from an anti-marxist perspective and basically for them it was a kind of I Told You So book that there is something intrinsic uh in Socialism or if they don't understand as a point I made earlier in communism there doesn't work just like there were all those books and articles in the 1990s in which it the the author would say something like in the 20th century there was a struggle between capitalism and socialism and now with the collapse of the s IET Union it's clear capitalism won socialism lost and out of that then grew this habit that I talked about a few minutes ago well socialism doesn't work as if Russia and Eastern Europe were the only places it had ever been tried as if the People's Republic of China in which more people live than in all the other parts of global socialism combined didn't count trying to disappeared you know it's when you need an argument to work and you've got really Troublesome facts you make the facts go away I mean that's that that's all of this is so we decided to write a book and to give you the the basis of this book published by ro ledge a global publisher based in England um the book is still available you can get it Resnik and wolf class Theory and history if you're interested we make the case that the the collapse of the Soviet Union was a collapse of its internal class structure and we show how that happened it's a you know it's a fulllength book it talks about the Soviet Factory it talks about the Soviet family it talks about planning it goes through the role of the government as opposed to the non-governmental sectors of the economy by the way there always were huge sectors of the economy that were not owned and operated by the government that were in effect private Enterprises you know the the nonsense that we had to Wade through it was a wonderful lesson for us that the Cold War had produced an immense industry of nonsense of propaganda I don't no Russians so I can't tell you if the the on the Soviet side they had the same they may have for all I know um but I do know that in French German English 95% of what was written was ideological propagandistic no bad bad bad they are bad bad bad bad we are very very good they are bad bad after a while repetitious in the way that that ideologues debate with one another but we weren't interested we were interested in what is what is going on and so we wrote a book and and in our view it's complicated but in our view we don't think they ever broke in Russia from the capitalist model of industrial or organization and what I mean by that is the employer employee model of how you run a business whether it's a factory an office or a store the Russians did it they just put governmental off so it's a it's a group of State officials are the board of directors or a group of State officials run the company sure okay that's for US state capitalism because the capitalist is in the state is part of the state apparatus rather than being a private nonstate citizen okay that's an interesting difference I don't deny that that makes a difference you get different outcomes if you organize it privately or Statewide but for me that's not what socialism is about for me you know I get this from Marx Marx's whole DUS capital is about how in a capitalistically organized business with employer versus employee where the employer buys the labor power hires the worker the worker produces a surplus capitalist receives it as a profit and the system work Works around maximizing the profit of Enterprise that's for me capitalism and I don't care whether the the capitalist who runs it is a private citizen or a government official I don't care in terms of whether it's capitalist or not I put an adjective because it's important this is private capitalism and this is State capitalism and once Steve Resnick my co-author and I once we worked that out we were then struck of course once you figured something like that out to discover that no one no less a leader than Vladimir Lenin in a very famous speech a year or so before he died in 1923 so you know four years into the revolution maybe five he referred after four or five years he referred to what they had accomplished the the Bolsheviks we've accomplished he said State capitalism now we have to undertake having captured the government having established state capitalism we have to undertake the process of moving the economy to post capitalism to and what did he mean well he says all the industries have to become co-ops no more employer employee over that's capitalism State capitalism in our case in the Soviet Union what capital we want equality democracy one one worker one vote we decide democratically what to produce how to prod produce where to produce what to do with the results that's a Democrat that's what socialism is aiming at otherwise we have made a revolution to go from private capitalism to State capitalism and I'm glad we did that says Lenin but that's that's only the beginning if we stop there we have here comes a danger if if we stop there we have betrayed the revolutionaries goal which was to go much further that issue do we stay at State capitalism or do we go further that issue is fought out right now everywhere where there is socialism in a hundred little moments in lots of different ways of thinking and acting that issue is being debated and fought out whereas in the west the hostility to everything means that they're not aware that that's the issue let alone that it's being fought out there is the same blindness to where socialism actually is in the world that you have in the west the same blindness to the decline of the American Empire they cannot face it and you know it's not so unusual when Empires decline the people caught up in the decline have to go through quite a struggle and period to get Beyond denying it to get to the point of saying yeah it is happening now what do we do about it how do we manage it and of course the risk I'm not shying away from it the risk is there that when you have Russia China with nuclear weapons in the United States and with nuclear weapons that that these people will destroy the whole world rather than work out their differences that's you know that's what's in the mind of I would argue nine10 of the people of Ukraine why is this happening to us they ask why isn't zalinski and his people on the one hand and Putin and his people on the other or the United States and whoever the the key players here are why aren't they sitting down as we all know they eventually will why don't why don't they save a lot of Destruction save a lot of lives save a lot of horrible suffering do it now don't wait and the same in Gaza or in the West Bank or in Lebanon now it's it's just an enormous part of my family of origin was French and German an enormous part of them were killed in World War II I know because my grandmother told me 8 million stories and my mother and father told me 8 million stories and I was the child who watched their facial expressions their tears I know what war means my fellow Americans don't except those that have been in the military they know and in case you don't know let me assure my audience we have an amazing problem of the mental health and suicides of our mil our soldiers they are traumatized by what we put them through and I'm not speaking of what happens to the people in the countries where we send these that's a whole another horror but to undertake a war means in my mind that you have no idea what you are doing and since I know that the world wars one and two were largely fought in Russia that the major deaths were Russian I kind of know they know what the risk of War means but they're playing with Americans who don't and that's part of what's going on here too which of course the American Media cannot explore because it might end up making Americans culpable so we don't hear that but everybody should understand because you don't hear it doesn't mean it isn't there yeah Richard just to wrap up this session in your opinion with what's going on that you mentioned what's going on in Ukraine do you see the policy makers in the United States capable of learning what has been going on in Ukraine or even in the Middle East to not go and have the same kind of conditions with China no I have no con I have no confidence that they have that ability or I see no tendency among them to go in that direction here's the irony of a of where people like me are I cannot help noticing that the American Pentagon the military Center of American strategic thinking is constantly telling this government that it cannot go to war with Russia that this is a impossible course of action so the problem then becomes that you have political authorities and this has happened before it's not the first time polit not the first time in the United States and not the first time globally the political authorities want to go to war but their own military tells them we're not ready we're not prepared we're not sure what the outcome will be if we fight a nuclear war we risk everything if we fight a non-nuclear war we may well be defeated uh therefore we're not ready maybe we can get ready if even that makes sense but we're not and so they're held back not by a popular Uprising because Americans don't know from their own experience what war is you don't you don't have here the kind of Peace movements you do get in other countries particularly those who have a war memory built in but you can have a war blocked by the military telling you they're not ready they're not ready to do it and by the way not ready is a very complicated judgment people should not be naive it is not only about how many missiles you have or how many rounds of howitz or shells you can put into effect it also is the military give you an example when the Supreme Court killed affirmative action few months ago it carved out an exemption for the military they can go ahead and do it why because our military now is I don't know 40 to 50% black and brown people if you have white Supremacy emerging politically you are creating unbelievable tension inside your military these people are not going to work together they're not going to trust each other you can't you have your military dissolves not in the battle but in the internal politic they're very very worried the white people the military gets come from the same communities not all together but heavily that are full of white supremacy are they bringing that with them into an army that has not only you know has black and brown people in it but is typically fighting black and brown people I mean all of that's wrapped up here they're not ready and they're acutely aware we lost the other Wars you know we lost them we're losing if you see in Ukraine where the border is it's moving in One Direction West that's away from Russia that's what they want the Russians that's what they're getting the Russians not just Crimea but the four areas in the whole uh Dumas and so forth it just and yet there is this crazy our secretary of state Mr blinkin is willing to have conversations about how uh to assess Mr zelinsky's plan for victory this is lunacy this is just okay this is popular theater for a society whose government cannot risk admitting to its own people what is actually going on it and these are all signs of decline these are not signs of strength that's the rationale we have to show we're strong you don't you show you're weak you just don't don't get it and when when you get the polling results and they show that Mr Putin is much more popular than any politician in the west you know you pretend it doesn't matter okay I mean I I don't believe in polls either but there it is and it's been true throughout the war no one in Russia seems to mind what Mr Putin is doing they think he's doing a great job large parts of the world do too but then again these are the same people who don't see the problems and think they'll go away and you know again final Point repeated when Empires decline one of the ways people cope with it is to pretend it isn't happening that's why it's often possible to date the end of an Empire even though that's a slow process that happens usually over decades there is something there's that moment when having denied it you finally get to such an explosive moment that no denial is possible that's when the barbar Ian or the Savages come roaring across the gate into your cities and then everybody realizes oh the Empire has collapsed no it collapsed years before but you have been busy hoarding if you're rich enough to have something to hoard pushing the costs onto your fellow citizens driving them to anger and bitterness as a result splitting the country apart all of those things are what made it possible for those folks to come into your city that last week but that's not when your Empire collapsed same thing in the United States it's the inability to see and the greed to hold on because you don't see yourself as part of this process someday we'll have the leaders who will say to corporations and the rich here are your choices give up half of what you have to the rest of the society because if you don't you won't have anything to give anyone at all yeah uh thank you so much Richard for being with us today I hope I did not end on a on a difficult note on the other hand I Blame You Nema you encourage us to be honest and say what we have in our minds so that's what I've done you you did a great job thank you so much all right thank you bye-bye bye-bye
