keep in the what hi everybody today's Thursday November 7th Michael just skip yourself yeah that's that's good okay and we we have the economic round table today with Professor Richard W and Professor Michael Hudson con two Economist thank you so much for being with us today welcome back very very pleased to be with you and my condolences that you have to listen to two economists not just one indeed I call myself a futurist [Laughter] now let's get started with what has happened in the United States Donald Trump wins 2024 presidential election in your opinion if you were to mention the main factors that have led to his victory in 2024 what would you mention let's start with Richard okay um there are of course many ways to answer such a question I don't pretend mine is comprehensive but this is what strikes me I think what we have witnessed here in both in both elections that he won and in the interregnum of Mr Biden what we have seen is a massive Revolt by the American employee class against 40 Years of neoliberal globalization in those 40 years roughly following the quote unquote opening up of China by Kissinger and Nixon we have seen a massive hollowing out of American manufacturing particularly but Allied industries of all kinds who basically followed the dictum that was taught to them in the business schools of this country namely that if you wish to Succeed in Business go where the wages are low and the market is growing uh the place over the last 40 years where the wages were low and the market was growing the most was the People's Republic of China so that's where they went at first it was only the daring ones who went because China is far away China is run by a Communist Party and that took a bit of Courage but when they were able to make stupendous profits it quickly became clear to all their competitors who were less staring that they better go to China too or if not China well then Vietnam or Bangladesh or somewhere where they could cash in on what was clearly The Profit wage of the future and in a typical manner of capitalists they cared nothing for the damage that their decisions rre on America on the country on the places in the United States where manufacturing had settled for example Detroit or Cleveland or Pittsburgh or and I could go on those places were Savaged the jobs disappeared the people left for example uh in 1970 population of Detroit was around 2 million today it's around 700,000 what a spectacular um economic analysis made by people leaving because there is no work there is no way to survive these towns and cities collapsed the states that relied on them collapsed they had to cut back on their social services in the bizarre way that capitalism works the no Revenue to the state so it can't do public services at the time the people need the most I mean you have to be upside down not Not to Laugh to Keep from Crying but now to get to the nub of it the working class has had its revenge it has looked at the political parties Republican and Democrat and by here I mean the Republican Party of the likes of George Bush and the Democratic party the likes of Clinton Obama and now uh Biden and they have said to them here let me show you my middle finger because what you have done to me I am now going to do to your political Representatives because I can't do it to you I can't get at you at least I haven't figured out how to do that yet so I am going to punish your political spokespeople the Obamas the clintons the bidens and maybe I should add now the harrises that's what we see here voting them out is that because they like Mr Trump not at all he is a symbol most of the people who voted for him wouldn't like him wouldn't want to have anything to do with him or are in fact sympathetic to number of the issues where he is on the wrong side for the vast majority of Americans like abortion for example and other issues as well but that was overwhelmed by what is overwhelming them and that is the end of the so-called American Dream it's completely out of their reach and it is not going to happen to their children either and they know it and they're angry and Mr Trump says I agree with you you have been shafted but I'm going to undo all of that I'm gonna go backwards and make me America great again to what it was before these last 40 years really wrecked you now there is no chance that he can do that as far as I can see he has as much chance as you do Nema in accomplishing that and I don't mean any disrespect I think Michael can do it I can't do it it's no one can do he can't do it and his proposals to to protect the American worker by a wall of Steel against the invading immigrants or a wall of tariff against the product invading Chinese is childish it's silly it won't work it has terrible side effects that drown the objective anyway it is but here's what it is and this is my last point point an old teacher of mine once said over and over again so I never forgot it you can't beat something with nothing what Mr Trump did in true Madison Avenue Advertiser fashion was to claim I'm the protector of working people to get up on a white horse say it over and over again and my wall of Steel against the invading migrants and my wall of tariffs against the invading Chinese look at me I'm protecting you people don't even know what a tariff is half the time let alone what its effects might be economic literacy in the United States is famous for its deeply underdeveloped state so he but he had an image a wall of Steel a wall of tariffs and he Pres against that what did what did the Democrats do same old same old little puttering around the edges $25,000 for a family buying a house for the first time an extension of the child tax credit nice things but with none of the pizzazz none of the drama none of the great gestures so Trump is riding along talking to them about protection it's but it is very welcome  she doesn't even give them  she gives them little details which they can't basically understand which draw no drama at all and she's defeated because she represents no big enough change from what they've had for 40 years whereas Mr Trump is all about imagery of change no real change of course not he's just a puppet like they all are but it is a drama of change that's why it's important for him to say what no one else dares say whether it's racist or misogynist or any of the other Horrors that come out of his mouth that's his brand that's what he does I remember one of the great comedians who's taught me a lot Richard prior he would get up on stage genius that he was and I mean that sincerely and he would talk about sex and the people loved it sitting in his audience 50% white 50% black they were laughing with an intensity that only a therapist would be able to recognize they were enjoying all of those discussions of the details of sex which they fantasize but would never dare participate in he was saying it they could enjoy it and if anyone got into trouble it would be him the comedian they were safe wow that's Mr Trump I'm gonna Stick it to these people I'm going to stick it to the and it's not serious it's not that they really want to hurt anyone but they want protection and they want the aot's joy the fake Joy of being involved in someone who is going to Smite the enemy that's what we saw our politics is a politics of theater it has been that way a long time and we just went through a particular theater but it's grounded in the decline of the American Empire and in the crisis of American capitalism which does not know how to back away from the globalization that it still needs and to go in the direction of the protection it kind of knows won't help it and it's caught it doesn't know what which way to go and we're gonna watch that crazy struggle be fought out by Mr Trump Michael well since Richard has described the economics uh forces behind the election uh and said almost everything that I would have said in my own language uh that leaves me to discuss the politics uh of the election and actually uh this is one of the few elections where uh it was a win-win for both parties each party got what they wanted the Republicans won overwhelmingly and as Richard pointed out I think the Democrats only won 35 counties in the entire country uh it it was uh total uh Wipeout with Republican red on all of the uh the uh the maps but the Democrats also got their choice they chose uh the same uh what they they made eight years ago in 2016 when they backed Hillary they would rather lose with Hillary than win with Bernie or a pro- uh labor policy uh this time around they lost by appointing uh camela uh Harris instead of risking a primary that who knows someone like Bernie uh might have won they're not going to take any chance at all of there being uh any Democratic Party candidate who suggests the kind of uh healing that Richard has been talking about so they they've locked in their control of the proall street neocon Wing in control of the Democrat atic National Committee that controls the Democratic party uh and even Bernie Sanders in the wreckage of the election uh spoke out uh over what has to be eight years of utter frustration he wrote on X uh it should come as no great surprise that a Democratic party which is abandoned workingclass people would find that the working class has abandoned them when the while the Democratic Leadership defends the status quo the American people are angry and want a change and they're right well Harris kept repeating these words again and again uh right down to her concession speech dream aspiration and ambition of the American people not a word about Economic Policy just uh platitudes and I think that that uh finally led the Americans to uh voters to get absolutely disgusted at the refusal to talk about economic policy that left uh Mr Trump the only person talking about this at least in a kind of mythological rhetorical framework that uh Richard has designed people don't want to dream they want to escape from the economic nightmare that they're in that uh uh that will help them get out of their economic bind uh they're deepening debt bind and the lack of access to housing that's what people said uh and the uh the election also succeeded both for the Democrats and the Republicans in preventing any third-party alternative that could possibly have uh challenged them by uh having a pro uh Pro Labor anti-war uh agenda uh and I I think this election shows that the US really is no longer a democracy that's a victory for both the Republicans and the Democrats uh uh but it's more than that it's a failed State and the failed state is a result of deliberate policy it's not somehow they failed to do what they wanted to do uh but both parties in supporting Wall Street in supporting offshoring uh in supporting uh the the neocon wars in Ukraine uh and Palestine uh this is this is uh what they wanted and the voters have uh said that what they wanted is something different all the polls were utterly wrong when it came to forecasting who is going to win what states but the polls I think were right in what they showed that voters said they wanted first of all they they wanted the wars in uh Ukraine and especially in Israel to stop they're against genocide against the Palestinians and the destruction of Lebanon uh the the Democrats of the world party and I have no reason to think that Trump will be any different uh for Israel although we don't know if he'll really uh uh pull America out of NATO in the Ukraine War uh and the second uh thing that voters said they wanted was the economy's polarization and we know as we've discussed on this show it's polarizing between debtors and credit creditors uh it's leaving more and more uh workers uh deeper and deeper into debt and uh this this FR frustrates them they they wanted someone who would have an anti-war policy and a pro-worker policy and neither of these available uh uh options were available to them at least to the Democratic and uh Republican candidates there was one candidate who represented what they said and you've had her on her show uh Jill Stein um here in New York uh she was not on the ballot uh my wife and I had to write her in uh the New York assembly uh controlled largely by uh the Democrats raised the number of signatures uh that any candidate needs to get on the ballot from 35,000 to 55,000 as soon as she met the 35,000 limit they raised uh the limit to 55,000 so uh you had to write her in same thing in Illinois District of Columbia Delaware uh Iowa Wyoming Vermont Kansas was she wasn't on any of these ballots uh the where she was on the ballot was in Michigan and this is what uh we've been talking about on your show for quite a bit uh in dear Dearborn Michigan that is very heavily Islamic she got 22% of the vote largely because of the Islamic uh population and uh I think that uh many of the Muslims who uh she convinced not to vote for Harris uh when she described the Democratic party as uh the war party I think they they obviously agreed with her but um many decided well we're not going to uh really actually cast our vote for her because uh we want to make sure that the Democrats lose so we're going to vote for uh Trump and so even though the votes for her didn't show up on the uh on the statistics balance sheet I think the fact that she went around to uh Michigan Wisconsin Minnesota and other of other places to say there is a pro uh uh peace option there is a pro labor o option things don't have to be this way I think that that certainly catalyzed uh the feeling uh that uh it was necessary to get the Democrats out of power so she uh she did make uh a raise the issue but Nationwide if you say how many votes did she get 0 four% of the national votes and she got more votes than any other third- Party candidate but when they're only 0.4% you realize the impossibility in America of a third party having an alternative that would represent the kind of things that Richard and I and you have been uh talking about uh the best that Trump could do would be to verbalize them and say yes this is really what we need I'm For the Working Man but there's nothing uh even he didn't come right out and say here are the specific policies that I have and uh the voters at least recognized here's someone who says he's on our side the Democrats say they're not on our side they say we're going to talk about identity politics uh but uh not the identity of Voters as wage earners uh as uh being being squeezed uh in their budgets and being unable to afford housing and burdened with uh student loan debt so I I think that explains the overwhelming reaction not for uh Trump as Richards pointed out but really against the Democrats it's it's their plan that has failed but uh they chose to lose with that plan rather than than have leave any opening for any kind of concessions to actually help the majority of Voters Richard do you want to add something because the point that Michael raised that is so important that why the Democratic party didn't open up yeah well I mean they've not they've been confronted with this for quite some time now this is an established commitment of theirs you know it is often referred to in the popular press as having been captured by their donors you know they they've gone to the big money you have to have a lot of money to run an election in this country I believe it's 10 billion or some number like that uh that was spent this time around more than ever before so I mean where where in our culture do you get that kind of money once in a blue moon if you work at it the way Bernie did you can actually get significant money by having the mass of the people give you10 or $20 you can do that but you have to set out to do that and you have to give them a reason to do that you know imagine with me Ju Just as an experiment imagine with me a campaign that had said we're going to stop the war and we're going to take the hundred billion dollar that would have been saved by that war and we're going to cancel the student debt in this country all of it overnight we're going to liberate the or if you if you don't want that spread it out between student debt Mortgage Debt car debt you so everybody gets everybody gets a reduction in the burden of their debt wow will there be problems with such a policy of course are there wrinkles that have to be worked out side effects that have to be yes but you would have then had an image of what a vote in that direction what were going to be and that would have been a way better way to confront a steel wall and a tariff wall it would have been less murky obviously the steel wall doesn't work it'll be easy to establish that and the Tariff wall is so crazy that even Even in our society the bulk of business commentary on his tariff plan was mockery I read the financial press they know that that's crazy that the first reaction to a a program like that will be a level of inflation we haven't seen in this country for a long time and that is a political no no given the bad reaction to the inflation we just had which isn't the worst that we could have had so for me here's what I I wasn't of the opinion that many of my friends were that had Bernie run he could have won I'm beginning to be coming around to that because he would have had something and something is better than nothing he would have been different he would have he from sitting there with his mittens to accepting the label socialist these would have been the leftwing equivalent of of misogyny and of racism coming out of trump he was different because he says all that which is not supposed to be spoken well Bernie would have been saying what's not supposed to be spoken but it is in the hearts of most American working people who are in fact eager to get the help that a socialism could bring them he would be the embodiment of that I think he would have had a much better chance much better chance than she did or Biden would have because of who he is and by the way the polls do indicate as has been pointed out to me lots of polls that Bernie is the most popular politician in the country the one least uh associated with being corrupt way ahead of trump on that the question is what I noticed in those days that Bernie was running against Hillary the Democratic party is so much afraid of Bernie Sanders much more than Donald Trump and nobody understand they try to do everything to cancel him from the election what is the root of these fear about D Bernie Sanders in the Democratic party it's the history it's the history of the democratic party it came out of the Great Depression with an enormous left-wing Progressive I would argue majority I mean Franklin Roosevelt is the most leftist of our presidents and he was reelected three times that suggests an inference the further left you are the more popular you'll be that's the history of this country so the Democratic party understands in my judgment that and have been fearful those who want to be accepted by the successful middle capitalist class they've always been uncomfortable with those people that's why immediately 1945 Roosevelt is dead the war is over cancel the uh alliance with the Soviet Union and commence a systematic Purge of everybody you know left of a till of the Hun and get them out of office and get to lose their job make them worry about how they're going to survive get rid of Deport as many as you can get away with everything short of mass murder okay so wow are we surprised and they've been you know with a mix if you're a therapist I'm married to one Michael is so you'll pardon we bring them in but there's a mixture of guilt and hatred and rage they don't want those people they they they they are terrified that they will be stuck as the leftwing and that will what will be done to them is what they've been busy doing to their own left wing so they have to clean all that out and they and their children have picked that up without knowing it without not explicit it's in the it's in the DNA at this point so they they are afraid of that it's been good politics for them they got rid of the left and they were able to occupy the middle position champion of the working class get the working class votes win a lot of Elections that worked that was their policy that worked the problem now is that the Republicans figured out how to hang them up as not the party of the working class as the party that betrayed the working class that went for what the fact that the Republicans have bit hurt the working class way worse than the Democrats did that's hidden in the denunciation of the Democrats who couldn't do more in the way of helping the working class mostly because the Republicans wouldn't let them was genius you don't let the Democrats do for the working class even those who want to then you blame them for the failure to do and offer yourself as the alternative to the working class which is so angry at the Democrats for the fakery and that they want to give the finger to them and they will vote for Trump that's right and they'll hold their noses most of those Union men and women who were told by their leaders to vote for KLA Harris and who didn't do it they're still good union members they believe in the union they know that Mr Trump is no friend to theirs but they held their nose because more Angry than they could ever be at Mr Trump they were at the Democrats Who Don't Do Anything for them this this and as long as the Democrats stay with that as long as they talk and think the way Clinton and Obama and Biden do they will be long-term failures they may not by the way the Democratic party may not survive this the question is how many people are going to figure out what we're talking about here and draw the conclusion finally that there has to be a real Democratic party and and and to put itself forward and that may take some time and it might mean that you're out in the wilderness politically and you don't get many votes for a while every other capitalist economy shows that you can be in that situation and then when capitalism has one of its ever recurring crises you can suddenly I want to remind you that the largest block of Voters uh excuse me the largest block of elected representatives in the general the assembly National in France are marxists they're socialists Communists and so forth and greens but it's a coalition of the left and far-left that emerged Victorious they are now the opposition of Mr macron whose political future is right up there with mine that is to say there isn't any yeah Michael yeah I think that what Richard says is so obvious that should be so instantly uh understandable that it shows that Harris probably could have won if all she would have had to say is we're going to stop sending our money abroad and begin spending more of it at home but the uh or she couldn't even let Bernie write her speeches which certainly would have would have been a hell so the fact that uh they made that choice not to say what uh Richard says is necessary to me shows that the Democratic party cannot reform itself uh mainly because it's controlled by the donor class uh that he's pointed to uh instead of talking about uh talking to voters as wage earners that are being squeezed she played the identity politics card only over the abortion issue but also over uh the uh ethnic and racial issue and yet the Democrats lost uh their previous uh votes that had come from the black and Hispanics the blacks and Hispanic voters were turning towards the Republicans realizing that uh all of they were just being used as an identity to distract attention from the fact of uh that they were mainly concerned about the economic issues uh that we're talking about uh people decided that their identity was basically economic and economically they were suffering now if the Democratic party cannot reform itself uh and you're only left with Trump that makes promises uh that rhetorical promises that he's really not going to carry through certainly uh not with the support of the Republican Congress itself then that means America is a failed political state because of the impossibility of a third party alternative to uh the the duopoly in which the the rule of the Democrats is to prevent any kind of left-wing criticism or alternative to the Republican Party the Democrats want to keep the Republican uh right-wing proall Street Pro corporate policies uh in place that Richards described uh and uh simply suck uh any of the uh Pro aggressive Pro Labor uh politicians uh into it and neutralize it in the same way that they've neutralized Bernie and made him uh urge voters to vote for Harris uh losing a lot of his reputation in the process and also AOC that attracted uh attacked uh Jill Stein for saying a vote for uh the green party and Jill uh is uh a vote for Trump well we know that that's not the case uh statistically because now that the uh voting figures have come out the victory of uh uh Trump over Harris is so large that if all of the third party candidates would have gone to Harris it still would not have been enough to close the gap uh by which uh Trump won uh and this Gap was so large that even all of the shenanigans uh that could be done by the Democrats uh uh in vote ulation and the enormous uh Trump derangement syndrome that all of the mass media uh promoted none of that uh had any effect at all so uh how are you going to uh get an option in the American political system for solving the problem that the population cannot make ends meet and more and more voters are driven into debt just to survive uh and they're now defaulting at record rates and so is commercial real estate by the way facing default uh the solution to all this seems to be just uh the government is going to pump money into the Federal Reserve to pump money into the banks to keep lending people enough money uh to get by Rising the debt uh exponentially and leaving the solution to uh the uh the wage SCH squeeze is simply well borrow the money uh that's been the policy uh ever since Obama that maybe we can talk about later Richard yeah well I mean let me be the historian and the dialectician if I may there's a many many examples in human history in which leadership to consolidate itself to become secure excludes everybody else from an Ever narrower band of rulers until they're the only ones left and everybody else is excluded and then comes the Revolution and then it's over if you don't give people a chance to participate in one way they will participate in another way stopping them not going to work may take a while but the American working class is not going to go quietly into the level of poverty that is coming down the pike it's one thing if you've been poor for a very long time with your parent your parents were poor and their parents were poor and your grand and all you know is an endless history oral or written of poverty but the American working class in theth century was raised up to be a middle class in its mind and in its standard of living you are taking that away that's a whole another experience that's why they're so angry that's why they're so Furious that's why they're recuperating white supremacy and other utterly discredited prejudices they're very angry part of why Mr Trump is the candidate is he articulates this anger this turn to violence all of that all of that he does it as theater but that's what he does and maybe if people are frightened will it turn into realityy it might one a new way a new distraction for the American people would be to find Communists under everybody's bed that have to be rooted out we've been there before as a nation we can certainly recapture that Charming uh phase but there are alternatives and the alternatives are that people will in fact see that they need another political expression that the Democratic party has failed them and the Republicans in whom they have now placed their faith as the only alternative is a dead end also what then look it may work for a while to compensate the masses in their anger by saying throw out the Republican bring in the Democrat and then a few years later reverse and then a few years later reverse but at at a certain point the oscillation itself is no longer acceptable people see what that means the fact that growing numbers of so-called ethnic voters blacks Hispanics and so on voted for Trump is that the whole ethnic appeal and isn't pulling the way it once might have people have outgrown that takes a while more with some than with others it used to be if you were Irish you voted this way if you were Italian you voted that way if you're polish you vote that much of that is gone and it'll go with with with women it'll go with Hispanics it will go with African-Americans it's already doing that it is also a question of what we on the left do can we present not only a CR critique that includes the illation but also an alternative which means we have to build a new political party no one else is going to do it we're gonna do it and we have people allies that are thinking like that and have been already not just Jill Stein or Cornell West or the The Perennial socialist parties candidates they too but a much larger group that is now you know the Bernie people what are they thinking what are they now ready to do with or without him I think these are the questions that are going to be that are now on the agenda in an immediate way because the people who are sad that kahara is lost will have to within once they're sad his past is try to figure out what that means for them and the politics they claim they believe in I the question is then how are you going to get a third party and I think it needs a narrative and uh the uh the role of the deep state is to prevent any of this narrative from getting into the mass media or the public discussion or other people Bernie uh said uh 8 years ago he'd researched trying to start a third party and the barriers put up by the Republicans and Democrats to maintain their du duopoly was so uh strong that a third party wouldn't be viable without U at least one billionaire supporting them and uh amazing as it seems not a single billionaire has thought to sort of jump behind uh the bandwagon uh and I think part of the reason is that uh as Richard just said they have their own mentality that they've been locked into and it's a tunnel vision and it doesn't recognize uh the what is preventing America from recovering they don't recognize what has made America a failed economy uh and a failed state that prevents the economy from becoming unfailed I think that's really the problem I didn't mean to interrupt you when you pause start Richard sometimes I can't tell whether you stop no you're fine you didn't you didn't interrupt me at all um let me sketch I'm going out on the limb here but let me sketch for you a plausible I think scenario of how things might change if Mr Trump carries through or let me put it differently if he he draws to himself the crazy quilt of advisors that he did last time um and he goes through with his proposal to raise a tariff wall I believe there are a significant number of billionaires a significant number of Global corporations based here in the United States who will see that as an existential threat to their business and they will want to get Mr Trump and his crazy quilt advisers out of there and they'll try the usual things they do which we used to call Palace Intrigue and I'm going to assume that those don't work and they will eventually then discover that to get rid of Mr Trump they need a mass base right now the mass bace is apolitical that's half the people and the other half is divided between Republicans and Democrats at that point Michael and I probably won't be around but somebody younger than us will go to those billionaires and say we got a deal we will give you a mass base but you got to give us the following and that following will be a struggle between the left and right wings of whatever the left is at that time what they will demand that those billionaires and that may be what those billionaires won't go for then then we're back to square one but I wouldn't be so surprised if among the billionaires there weren't those who always had their heart with us but would never go there because it clashed with their interests but now we might be a force that would meet them halfway to their interests and halfway is a lot better than nothing at all if you're existentially threatened the American Empire is shrinking I have no doubt that Mr Trump will not be able to do anything significant about that therefore the situation is going to get worse 100% tariff against the best quality lowest price electric car and truck is not a sustainable position that's the position of the Biden Administration and he committed to tariffs against China will presumably sustain it but it's not sustainable therein lies that's the opening right right there multiply that by all the other products now in that situation or coming into that situation and I think you have a a a a fracturing of American politics and I think it's very possible that we will see a new Republican party of all of those people who are that and can't stand and Trump but don't want to be in the Democratic party for all sorts of reasons they're going to do that too by the way they they'll get money quicker than the left because they can offer what I'm telling you namely back to the neoliberal game the globalization game so that these big companies don't lose the enormous Investments they made in China and those other places that's very very important to them on many levels especially in a declining American Empire environment so I think we're going to see all kinds of unexpected we're in the the decline of an Empire has that it always did it starts squeezing its own people too much everybody becomes indebted too much shocked hit the system they can't cope with you know like Co where you lose what do we lose here million and a half people in this supposedly Rich medically developed Society we can't handle and these are leave deep scars these kinds of failed responses to crisis and there are more and more of them coming and Mr Trump's theater highly developed for vote getting can't do anything about those other it's not about votes it's about something else and they're not good at that they're just not good at that look how badly they handled the pandemic what a disaster of management that was it doesn't it's not an issue it's not a disease we don't have it we don't need it drink bleach I mean come on this is a level of fumble Bumble that people ought to think about it's not just those officials didn't do the work this is a systemic failure I think I think Michael in the end maybe proved more right than he knows that we are living through a decline but we're also living through a state that cannot function that was able to function on the ride up when all of your mistakes and sins are forgiven because the trend line is carrying you now the trend line is your enemy you make mistakes it exaggerates them rather than obscures them that's what happens when you're in Decline and I think that's what we're that's what we're seeing this vote is a vote of a system that's declining it's voting for the clown the theatrical performance the wall did nothing the wall is a joke it's a waste of money you know and yet here it is it's a powerful symbol and it's going to be look Biden spent money on that wall he could not walk away from it he couldn't and and kamla Harris mumbled remember about immigrants she felt she had instead of turning around and giving an alternative a theater of Welcome to the you know would have been much more effective much more effective Michael well mention Michael can you hear me Michael yes can you hear me yeah you didn't mention RFK J I turn my microphone louder it's okay everything's okay okay but you Michael you didn't mention RFK Jr when in your calculation the Trump's I think Trump's wild card in 2024 election was RFK junr which was the problem that the Democratic party defeated Itself by the situation with RFK Jr which helped Donald Trump well I don't think RFK Jr is going to the core problem uh I think that U what Richard has talked about is uh the probably the most logical and reasonable way for America to try to escape the failed State Corner in which it's painted themselves uh but his hope is based on Corporate America and of course cor Corporate America would be disastrously hit if Trump actually were trying to impose his tariff policy uh but the the problem that is really blocking that uh even if you solve that you uh the you're not going to deal with uh the even to me even larger financial problem and that's uh Wall Street and the debt problem the corporate America is suffering in a way just as much as the wage earning class by by the fact uh that it's been financialized into a debt overhead uh and I don't think there's been any real discussion of uh debt uh ever since 2008 the zero interest rate policy that was supposed to pull America out of a depression only made the wealthiest 10% enormously richer well the 90% of the population has drifted down in the sense of their wages uh and living standards that's the problem that really has to be solved and uh the uh the a that you can solve the depression by giving more money to Wall Street not to the corporate sector except in a financialized way uh but uh to the stock market the bond market uh and the real estate market is I think the false narrative that uh they're going to use to confuse uh the uh the voters and uh sort of throw a monkey wrench into that uh I want to quote something that o Obama made remarks in uh April 2009 uh when he was criticized for bailing out the banks and uh evicting millions of American families uh who were victimized by junk mortgages I think in uh uh one uh paragraph he summarized the whole Democratic party uh policy ever since the spin American policy and that explains why we're in a permanent Financial depression without a radical uh change what Obama said I'm going to quote there are a number there are a lot of Americans who understandably think that government money would be better spent going directly to families and businesses instead of the banks where is our bail off they ask the truth is that a dollar of capital in a bank can actually result in eight or10 of loans to families and businesses a multi multiplier effect that can ultimately lead to a faster pace of economic growth this multiplier effect of debt is what is strangling though uh Strangling the economy uh the multiplication is compound interest of debt and the Democratic party uh has uh capped their military keynesianism the idea that well uh if you employ employment by the merchants of death group The military-industrial complex that's going to create jobs the Democrats have now added this to financial keynesianism giving money to the finance to the stock market and the bond market and the banks uh uh of the bankers of the merchants of death will enable uh Banks to lend America enough money to cover the fact that their wages are not keeping up um with their living costs uh and uh the solution is simply to give more credit and and that's what's popularized almost every uh week in the main um media the solution to the depression is to leave the American economy more debt ridden I think that that that is a block that uh Corporate America is going to have difficulty separating its interests from the Wall Street interests uh and it's the financial uh problem that I think voters are mainly complaining about when they're talking about the economic problem and I think that is what they essentially the Democrat solution is well sorry your wages haven't kept up with inflation but we've helped you borrow enough to get by and even to buy your own homes uh by lowering the down payment rates and giving new buyers uh some kind of subsidy to take them uh uh take out a large enough mortgage to outbid the interest payments that other buyers are willing to pay in their attempt to join the middle class the fact is that the access to the middle class is closed off except by running into a lifetime of debt that actually uh ends up uh on your back as a burden on your back uh and I think this housing squeeze is something that uh uh is independent of the corporate uh interests when it comes to uh trade with China and tariffs and uh uh uh and uh the rest of what Corporate America wants in in supporting a popular party uh I don't think you can have a popular party that doesn't uh recognize uh the debt burden and that's why uh Richard pointed out that Harris could have won if she would have promised to wipe out the uh uh the student loan debt and probably other kinds of debt and thear she she could have wiped out and reversed the debt overhead that is the one thing that is anathema uh to the uh Democratic party and uh housing in debt is now a requirement to join the middle class uh that Mobility is now closed off uh to most wage earners unless they have wealthy families who've uh given them uh a house to uh inherit uh I guess that only works with h uh if you only have two children uh so the policy that uh politicians have sponsored extending home ownership have had the opposite effect by uh loading the economy down with debt they've prevented uh wage earners from joining the middle class and the result is that absentee owned real estate corporate real estate like Blackstone uh and other investors in housing uh landlord uh ownership of uh homes is increased by 10% AG points since Obama we've reversed the whole movement towards America to become a middle class that that's part of what's closed off and uh it's been the Democrats that have L LED this uh precisely because of what uh Obama has sort of Justified and what you see defended by people like Paul Krugman and the other Democratic uh uh promoters in the New York Times and the other media uh you could say that raising a mortgage Banker's guideline so you know when when uh in the 1960s when I bought a home uh the uh the banks wouldn't lend if the mortgage payments absorbed more than 25% of your income but now the government guarantees payments uh uh mortgages uh up to 43% uh of American Income well imagine a 43% of your wage is going for for housing uh 18% for medical care uh than local and taxes no wonder there's there's a wage squeeze on America but the price of housing is not included in the uh uh in inflation index the things that really matter are to most voters uh are not included in the wage index so this idea of will'll solve all of your problems by keeping uh prices uh down uh so that you can afford to uh uh somehow get by without debt uh is meaningless if they don't address what the actual Financial squeeze requiring lower down payments raising the portion of income that's paid as interest uh it it's it's squeezing wage earners but it's also squeezing corporations uh we've just discussed before how corporate income has now been taken over by the uh Financial Officer uh who uses the income to increase stock prices by stock BuyBacks and by paying out the profits as dividend look at uh Boeing uh aircraft is a model of the American economy as a whole uh it it used its income not to pay uh wages but it essentially decare war on its uh its uh workers it stopped paying them the retirement income that had promised them uh it had used the income instead of keeping the wages in uh in keeping with the prices of the boing aircraft and the profits they simply use their profits to increase stock prices and pay the executives more so just imagine how the what the workers see is their narrative is uh you have the let's say the upper 10% or 1% they're living in a different uh world uh I think on naked capitalism uh was an article by Lyn Paramore about look at how we have two different worlds today uh one world for uh medical care for the wealthy another for the medical care for for the poor not not so heavily look at Travel look at the way that uh the 10% can travel with their yachts and their personal Jets uh flying around the world to Great parties with each other uh and compare that to the struggles that most Americans have uh in trying to take a vacation as they're cutting back uh what they're doing look at the difference in housing between uh the mansions and the housing that's available uh is construction becomes Sher and Sher uh for the Americans look at the educational difference uh the wealthy classes getting uh into high universities um with their parents paying for their college education as opposed to wage earners who have to have their own family are themselves take on the student debt there's uh we back in the Epic of Charles Dickens in the mid-9th century describing this Tale of Two Cities one city for the wealthy one city for for the uh for the masses uh that are looked down upon both by the Democrats and the Republicans the the problem of getting uh the corporate uh Industrial class to realize this problem uh at a time when the corporate industrial class itself has been taken over as an arm of Wall Street just like the political parties have been taken over by by Wall Street uh I I think is uh so INF insurmountable that that's why Richard said it probably won't be in our time when we see the solution and uh I agree with them there cannot be a solution to the problem that we're in with a revolution and uh you have the Deep State uh hijacking the American political process but also the American economy the corporate economy uh foreign trade and uh all of the other elements of the economy it's all been hijacked and uh uh Trump has perceived the anger at all of this uh and the uh certainly the voters are disillusioned with the Democratic party uh I and as I said I think the Democratic party is unreformable you've seen what they've done to Bernie uh you've seen how of course if uh Pamela Harris camela Harris would have said uh what Richard said would have won you know will solve uh your student debth problem will act on your behalf of course they could have won it was their choice not to and uh Bernie who can voice these problems who recognizes many of these problems couldn't get uh any uh acceptance within the Democratic party except to be co-opted uh and that's the problem that I think whoever tries to work through the Democratic party is going to be co-opted just as Bernie and AOC and any other would be populist I so as S stand the only hope of uh getting a third party is trying to find trying to convince the U corporate class that there's another uh narrative but the corporate class itself is has a lot of barriers about uh raising raising any of these points and acknowledging these points so you need not only a description of how people are suffering yes there's a one one economy for the wealthy there's another economy for the 90% or the 99% uh but there's also a different Narrative of how economies work and I think that's uh what Richard and I as economists are trying to explain we're really discussing a different economic narrative as well as a political narrative and uh the the problem is that uh we this economic narrative that we have is limited to your show and our own blogs and uh the sort of satellites uh the groups all over around us that have uh uh ideological agreement with us but uh we're pretty much in a minority and uh we're we have our own glass ceiling that we can't make it into the mainstream Richard do you want to add something or I want to ask a question about I do want to add I want to pick up on that quotation from Michael from Obama that the dollar given to the bank multiplies through lending whereas the you give to a citizen who's been hurt by something does it that's the kind of mistake which a student in a freshman class in economics is understood to be allowed to make but for the president the only reaction I have is shame on you if you give a dollar to a worker where do you think he puts it you idiot he puts it in the bank and there's the extra dollar from the government via the worker that goes into the bank if they want to lend it out lend it out that's what they do with deposits you don't have to give it to them directly you can give it to the business you can give it to the worker to resolve their debt problems for example they will then put it in the bank or they'll pay their creditor who will put it in the bank the extra money will find its way into the banking system where it will get multiplied in the way that the banking system does what Mr Obama was doing was reading a mediocre brochure put out by the local bank to make itself look like it's a socially useful institution that's the level of economic literacy we have that a president who graduated from Harvard can't do better than that wow that the people listening to him think that he just said something that isn't embarrassing wow that's what we got to deal with though that's why the changing the narrative is so important reminds me of George Carlin who said you know why they call it the American dream because you have to be asleep to believe it you know he he understood that's where wokeism comes from you got to wake up Jack otherwise you are being led down the Garden Path to your own demise look it it is very important for people to understand that if you cut the profit in half you could give all workers a lot more wages and then the profit would be in half and then you would have to deal with whatever ever The Fallout is from cutting the profits in half and there will be consequences and you would have a government designed to deal with those consequences but no one should imagine that this isn't an eminently reasonable policy the last 40 years in the United States have seen real wages flat they gone nowhere in 4 year 40 before that they Rose for a century or more every decade from 1820 to 1970 every decade re even in the Great Depression real wages Rose in the 1930s then in the 1970s they stopped meanwhile advertising went crazy if you want to be a real American you should have a car a vacation a washer dryer of this of that in other words if you want to participate in America you got to consume but we're not going to give you the wages with which to do it what did the poor American working class do two things one went to work more hours took a second or third job very famous wrecked the family second thing borrow money like no working class in the history of the world that's how they were able over the last 40 years to survive a flat real wage as a footnote in the People's Republic of China which has a lot of problems real wages have quadrupled in the last 40 years that's the biggest difference in the world flat here 400% over there wow no wonder the world is experiencing the decline of one Empire and the rise of another and we can talk to the people about they don't have to imagine that one of these policy it's like last my last it's like listening and I go nuts with this to the discussion of our national debt and here's how the discussion goes in America well we either have to cut back the spending or we'll have to borrow more and we don't want to borrow more because we have a big national debt but we don't want to cut the spending no they talk as if raising taxes can't happen as if there as if God himself or herself is has said you can do this and you can do that but you can't do that what what if we taxed all wealth above 1 billion billion a person we'd have a solution to most of our problems Elon Musk alone could actually do something patriotic which give us 240 out of his $241 billion dollar of assets he'd have to live on a billion the poor fellow and so to Warren Buffett and so to bill we can tax what there's no problem we have the majority we tax we solve the problem we can maintain spending and we don't have to borrow a nickel we can retire the debt in fact that would be one of the ways to offset whatever negative things happen if you tax the r the notion that you can't go there that's simply an attempt on the part of that part of the population to rule any burden on them out of discussion off the table and the Democrats talk like that they've accept accepted that rule and that's the worst example you could possibly come up with with them offering no significant alternative at all they did they are so Bamboozled by the media and the Republican domination of this conversation that they can't Advance any tax at all even when they say tax the rich when you look at what they propose it's childish it's half of 1% not going to solve anything you cannot mess with the distribution of wealth and income and the proof of it we just had a presidential election in which neither candidate acknowledged spoke about promised to do something about the fundamental distribution of wealth and income not one word amazing Mike do you want to add something or well let let this problem is not only in the United States it's worldwide uh let's suppose Harris somehow would have won and like the Democrats could have stolen the vote that would have meant the end of the democratic party because uh it would have shown how absolutely bankrupt it is I think voters didn't have to go through the trauma of harist administration to realize this they've all realized how bankrupt it is but uh let's look at what's happening in England under Ken starmer's takeover of the British labor party same thing uh people uh thought uh the conservative party uh is so right-wing so uh Pro wealthy so pro- Financial we we've we've got to smash things up uh and vote vote for labor and uh immediately uh starmer and the labor party did just exactly what happened under Tony he moved to the right-wing of the conservative party and now uh his uh his popularity his plunged uh way down to the all-time low off for the labor party that is what would have happened in the United States uh had uh Harris won uh that would have been a kind of revulsion that would have led people to think there must be an alternative uh but I think the uh deep State and the Democratic party strategist have tried to say how do we prevent any alternative from developing how do we prevent uh the kind of uh escape to save the American economy and uh society that uh Richard has described uh I I think that uh as I said uh the nobody's been able to solve the problem of how to politicize this and if you look at how radical parties uh been made successful in the last 100 150 years uh it very often it's been from the wealthy classes uh it's not been from below but alone it's been by wealthy uh supporters that is what is lacking today because it's a whole mentality it's a whole narrative uh that the wealthy people believe that they've actually earned their wealth and the American GDP statistics describe uh the uh wealthiest 10% is being uh the whole core of the growth in the GDP all the growth in the GDP since that before 2008 has been to to the wealthiest 10% not to the 90% it's a fictitious picture of growth because it doesn't realize that uh there are two economies uh the kind of the rtier economy uh Wall Street Finance real estate insurance and uh rent recipients uh of various forms and the economy of production uh they just don't think uh in in that way and uh I wasn't able to uh work it into the academic curriculum uh when I was teaching and uh Richard had a very fortunate opportunity to do that in in Massachusetts that uh is by no means available uh nationally uh these days so uh the the problem is that it's it's just uh even Obama in that 1990 uh that uh 2009 speech said I want to quote what he said it's they realize this it's not sustainable to have an economy where in one year 40% of our corporate profits come from the financial sector that was based on too much on inflated home prices maxed out credit cards over leveraged Banks and overvalued assets or an economy where the incomes of the top 1% of skyrocketed while the typical working household has seen their income decline by nearly $2,000 well that's just what we've been discussing and what uh Richard said but that's the democ uh the Democratic party thinks that if we can Rec if we can just say that we feel your pain that people are going to think oh I'm so glad you feel your pain our pain is you're causing this pain uh that uh that obviously isn't going to work the it's as if the Americans have hit a political wall uh of uh being locked in that is blocking the solution of its economic problems and I think that's uh why uh the we've hit U we've become a failed State uh Harris lost despite a shift of the affluent voters her way uh the the it was the lowincome voters Who provided the margin uh for Trump uh and I think the Trump had a massive Improvement of Voters under $50,000 49 to 48% uh uh and even more when it gets even lower but uh Harris won the voters over $100,000 a year 54% for uh against 45% so certainly you you're not going to have the wealthy class recognizing that it's it's control of the economy can't survive politically uh they're trying to figure out well how can we make the Deep State the FBI the justice department uh just prevent um us from losing this position how can we say well if you're making the kind of CR iism that Richard and I have been making you're uh uh we're going to block you from uh the the media uh access to the media we're going to uh I mean uh starmer has uh made it a penalty in England to criticize uh the Israelis and to stand up for the Palestinians in this you can you can look at what's happening in England as the Iron Fist of the rightwing in the Deep state and uh what it's trying to do uh and obviously that's what America should avoid uh but the question is whether uh the we have exactly the same Dynamic here that's destroying the uh the uh policy uh it is interesting that uh the overnight while we were watching uh what was happening to the votes the Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped 1300 points that's over 3% on its way to Jumping 15 % uh uh 1500 points by the end of the stock exchange yesterday you you've seen the financial class applauding uh what Trump is doing do they do they think that he can solve their problems what are they thinking how do you explain this I can't explain it I would not have uh uh thought that from anybody's Victory would have uh up created a stock market boom uh I I don't think there's anything that I can think of that would have Justified a stock market boom that there you go it's going way up it it's as if what we're describing is an illusion has uh covered uh certainly it's covered the uh class wealthy enough to have significant stock and bond Holdings uh interest rates are jumping at the same time it's very rare that interest rates would jump up at the same time when the stock market's going up they've always been uh the inverse we're we're in a we're in a world of chaos right now uh and I I can't imagine what Trump is really going to do I don't know the difference between what he said uh he's going to do to uh get uh support of uh backers by promising he's going to put nut cases like uh pompe or Tim C Tom Cotton in charge of the military and state department or whether he's uh doing what Roosevelt did and just uh uh well okay I'm going to talk about a wide range of possible survivors while actually doing what he wants all all along I have no idea uh who who uh what's going to really happen and whether the uh the investors in the stock market who think they've got the world running their way and we've solved the economy problems which means their problems of how are we going to keep making money financially uh is that how long can that uh idea that uh getting the wealthy stock market Wall Street investors rich is solving the economy's problems I I think this is uh inherently unstable uh it's not a problem that other people are recognizing or even talking about that's why I think we're in for a chaos period let let me offer uh an answer I think I know why the stock market is booming uh here's what it is if you look at the first time Trump was President those four years um 16 to 20 2016 to 2020 lots of bloviating lots of lots of noise one one legislative achievement the tax cut of 2017 December a massive tax cut favoring corporations on the one hand and the top 10% of the individual income distribution on the other an immense gift to that class of people people coming at the end of a 40-year period of massive redistribution of wealth from the bottom and the middle to the top The Logical argument would be would be excuse me that a tax cut at that time for those people was less needed than at any other time in history they are doing wonderfully the stock market is booming after 1980 famous for that they don't need a tax cut he gave them a tax cut the market is going up because they think especially if he wins the house for the Republicans which I I believe is still in the air uh he will do it again it's the only thing he did last time that's the one thing he can do partly because the Democrats a good number of them will vote for that too for fear of what might happen to them if they didn't vote for it the big donors in their district will go find a Democrat who will so that's why we have it why the interest rate because this lunatic is going to do something with tariffs and that's going to heat up the inflation again and that means the interest rates in anticipation of that are going to go up so you get the chaos M Michael's right you get the unusual that instead of low interest rates letting people buy on margin etc etc and boost the market now you get the Boost from the tax cut expectation meanwhile the policy suggests you better be careful with your interest rates you you want to lock in higher interest rates right so you you're you're going to pay less for your bond all of that the way that normally works the last point I I I really do want to make is that all of this the booming stock market the rising interest rates you know what that does it worsens the inequality it gives the rich remember 10% richest people own 80% of the stocks and bonds so if you boost the stock market you're rich enriching the already rich which makes them further away from everybody else meanwhile Rising interest rates mean that everybody has to pay more for their credit card everybody has to pay more if they need to get a car everybody fill in the blank this is terrible and if the in tariffs go through that'll give us an inflation and inflation hurts people who have less money relative to people who have more money because the people with more money can afford to pay the higher price everybody else can't so what are we doing we're making the situation that brought him in worse and so whoever runs for the Democrats will be saying about Trump what Trump said about the Democrats failed the economy fail vote him out they'll say about Trump fail the vote him out that's it just the isolation that passes for politics it's one of the reasons The Narrative is empty is because the two parties have a rule you can find fault with the other party but not in any way that goes into the actual economy and how it works when Bernie said it's rigged the massive people nodded they know it's rigged they know that the rich do what's necessary to protect and enhance their wealth that's all but the two party can cannot that's why there's no discussion of unequal distribution of wealth before and after the election Janet Yellen gives speeches about you know we need to be more inclusive in the beneficiary of our system how interesting but nobody says a word during the campaign she's out there giving these speeches mean nothing it's just verbiage that's the rule you can't talk about business Cycles you can't talk about a declining Empire and you can't talk about distribution of wealth and income why because those are the three most important aspects of the economy we're living through and those are Taboo it's unbelievable it's like pref Freudian psychology you can talk about everybody's mental health but you can't refer it to sex what does Freud tell us if you don't refer it to sex you'll never understand it you're crazy with what you're doing all right that's what we have we have a taboo that precludes us from understanding and then we scratch our heads and wonder why we can't control and can't understand what's happening to us it's a remarkable moment we're in but again it is not atypical for a declining Empire to be going through it declining Empires always breed in their people selective denial the first reaction to a declining Empire for many people is what are you talking about there's no decline okay that's one okay next Rel okay there is a decline but it's not us it's an external foreign evil force China or immigrants and then when you get through that one you begin I hope to listen to and participate in conversations that talk about how we are our own biggest problem and until we deal with that we're not going to stop the Chinese and we're not going to stop desperate people from migrating what we can do something about is our own economic system so let's talk about that and that would be my Hope from all of these conversations we have and it goes back to what Michael said at the beginning we need to change the narratives about what's going on yeah I think Richard's got it right he points to something that is very uh ironic in the past for hundreds of years uh inflations have always benefited the workers primarily uh that's why the uh rightwing uh anti-socialist economics the Austrian School the Chicago monetarists have all been infl against inflation what they mean is how do we prevent wages from rising uh the uh the peak of American wage increases was during the Vietnam war inflation of the 1970s uh that uh it was to oppose the rising wages that the Republicans came in uh with the auster austerity program Rising uh raising interest rates now uh but as Richard just pointed out in the case of tariffs uh that Trump is is proposing to impose these tariffs are going to be borne by American consumers so this inflation is going to be very different from all the inflations in the past that have tended to uh to to benefit Labor's wages this inflation will will be at the cost of real wages not reflecting the increase in wages so uh What uh in a way what uh uh Trump is proposing is to put the class war back in in business cutting taxes uh for the wealthy when they don't need it and what the economy needs is raising taxes on them and imposing tariffs that are going to eat into the wage levels uh this this is uh exactly the Dilemma uh that we're in all right one one I know we keep saying last one last comment one of the aspects of a declining Empire that I think we all need to focus on when an Empire declines those at the top the rich the corporate leaders they are in the best position to navigate a declining Empire they have the power and the money with which to hold on to the wealth they've accumulated and that means offloading the costs of a declining Empire onto somebody else the middle class the working class the poor they're the ones that's why we have an inflation that the social security doesn't keep up with that's why we haven't raised the minimum wage from $725 cents an hour since 2009 even though every year has been an increase in prices some a lot some a little but we have Savaged the poorest Among Us it it's and the inflation worked that way too because we had a short-term inflation where the prices led the wages who never really caught up so that worked again to shift the people at the top are taking care of themselves and that means the costs of a declining Empire are felt that much more on the middle and the bottom that too is part of a declining EMP Empire and that's another Factor shaking up the old consensus ideas of how you should Vote or what's going on in the world all right folks I think we have adjusted who will the uh cost be pushed on they'll be pushed on to other countries that's the first thing that Trump has promised as you know he said you know we're we're not going to pay for the war in Ukraine anymore that was this one anti-war statement we're going to make Europe pay for their own defense uh no more payment for that you can imagine the hysteria that this is all caused from the Ukraine to Germany uh to the NATO by way just a footnote the Germany government collapsed overnight yes yes gone and it's because of the social democ Schulz uh the Democrat Social Democrat said uh we have to fire uh the uh fre free enterprise Pro uh pro- Financial uh Finance Finance Minister because the Finance Minister who says we can't run a budget deficit well if you can't run a budget deficit with uh Trump not uh paying the cost of NATO in the war anymore if Europe continues to support the war on Russia uh in Ukraine then it has to drastically cut back all of its social social spending programs in an economy that's all already uh in the most depressed economy in Europe that so that's solving the American decline in Empire is going to uh first of all have uh reverberatory effects on uh all the American satellites that uh the Trump will be able to uh push the costs onto yeah yeah and all the other European governments that have aligned themselves with the United States are going to now realize they probably bet on the wrong horse well it's pretty hard to reverse it now I think it's going to take decades for them to reverse it they're stuck too yeah I can we can wrap up this session right now thank you so much for being with us today Richard Michael well we were ended on an optimistic note there's going to be a revolution yeah see you bye-bye
