today's Thursday October 31st and we're having Michael Hudson and Richard wolf with us to talk about the legacy of the Biden Administration for the next president of the United States and let's start with Richard how do you find it right now two important conflicts one in Ukraine and the other one is in the Middle East that we know that the next president of the United States should confront these two two difficulties and on the other hand we're going to talk about tariffs as well but when it comes to these two conflicts what's your take on that well I think like a number of what I would think of as the most important issues facing this country the two candidates have little or nothing to say so as far as I can tell there is a slight difference in the sense that there is speculation that Mr Trump um is not so eager to be persistent about Ukraine and rather more eager to be persistent about Israel and bashing China on the other hand the Democrats seem to think that their success lies in doing what the Republicans do just not so quickly not so harshly but otherwise to take their cue um therefore I don't think it's going to make all that much difference on these two issues uh what exactly happens when you add the social forces that are behind all of this they will be more important in shaping what the president whoever it is does than anything they say in general and anything they say during a campaign in particular when kind of they say whatever their polls suggest we'll get them more votes so this is like so much about our elections this is a theater I like to call it the theater of democracy because it's a substitute for the real thing uh which they do not want let me put this another way um in my view what we are experiencing what we are living through the three of us plus everybody else on this planet is the the decline of the American Empire and it takes a variety of forms foreign and domestic but I think in the end the Ukraine war is a kind of gesture a kind of um Shadow Boxing in which the United States is trying to convince itself its allies and as much of the world as possible that it's the global dominant power that it used to be and unfortunately it is demonstrating exactly the opposite although they don't want to face it yet they can't allow it to be discussed and so the two candidates say nothing like that do not admit it do not deal with it do not suggest ways that the United States can rationally deal with the decline of its own Empire they are engaged in a combination of denial and desperate pretense and basically I think that's largely what's going on in Israel as well Israel is trying to hold on to an impossible situation and the only country that gives it any significant support is the United States because it it has a vague notion that Israel will be its local leader in that part of the world the Middle East and is hoping to hold on to the fantasy that that's actually possible and it isn't in my judgment I think that's hopeless and the but the desperation is causing a lot of people to die and having the effect of mobilizing the alliances of Russia and China of both of them and India of bricks as a challenge to the West it is accelerating what it was designed to stop and they don't see that either so it's Full Speed Ahead doing all of these things now I could be wrong of course but that's if you ask how I see all of this that's the framework within which I see it you have two political parties who agree on all of the most important things that capitalism is the greatest thing since slic bread that there is no alternative that needs to be disc discussed there is no option and that the maintenance of capitalism equals the celebration of C of freedom and democracy and that everything the United States does in the world it does to expand the realm of freedom and democracy against the evil Alternatives that beset this project they used to be called socialism and communism and now they're called authoritarianism but it's the same game it's even got the same players they've barely changed their uniforms so we can all recognize who you mean and the hypocrisy of it all is right on display as it always was and it's overwhelmed by Propaganda and the two political parties do their part by being utterly silent on all of it Michael jump well I think Richard and I have been making this point through all of your shows uh and I think that a lot of the American voters are in agreement certainly they're in agreement that uh both presidential candidates are just frontmen for uh the Deep state or whatever you want to call it Wall Street and their financial backers uh and the is result of people finally catching on is that uh what's coming up next Tuesday is a typical American election who are you going to vote against uh the question's always the same who's worst uh and uh all that the Harris lady can say is well I'm not Trump and Trump can say well I'm not I'm not a Harris and uh the Trump haters are going to vote Democratic uh and uh voters who are disgusted with Biden and Harris and are going to vote for Trump uh but voters against Biden uh two big Wars are going to try to vote uh for Jill Stein uh and I'm sure when it's all over they're going to find the margin of Trump's victory over uh Harris certainly in the swing States is going to be uh less than the large of the gilstein third party vote and the Democrats are going to say oh we would have won if it wouldn't have been a third party that's the one thing we can never have in the United States we have to make it even harder for there to be any real choice of a third party uh in the United States there uh is there must be no alternative and uh the uh the issue is all going to be personified that uh Richard just described as what the underlying uh underlying force is I think the Democrats are going to lose because Harris has come out as the war Party candidate and I guess you could say the election is going to be which war party uh which war do you think is more important uh Harris is defending uh Ukraine uh Trump is defending Israel uh but basically the Democrats are the war party and I think that's what's going to defeat her in Michigan in Minnesota and other uh he States her war party stamps uh yesterday in the magazine the national interest uh General Bill Hodges uh one of the big uh Generals in the US and another National Security General uh gave a plea to American voters you must vote for Jill uh for kamla Harris uh because otherwise Russia is going to March you know right right through to recapture East Germany on its way to the Atlantic we must stop Russia this election is over do you want to stop Russia or not where for Trump it's saying this election is over do you want to stop a Chinese economic domination of the US economy uh or not in other words pick your enemy and it's the enemy that is defining the candidate because neither candidate has anything positive to offer uh the people so all you can do is play on everybody's resentment against the economy and try to channel that resentment toward the opposite party so it's a purely negative kind of election there's no longer an election over what kind of parties uh do you want and I think as Jill Stein said on your show a few months ago uh Nema that uh the U she expect she agrees with what Harris is saying uh and what the leftwing of the democratic party such as AOC is saying a vote for uh Joe Stein against war is a vote for Donald Trump uh and we're okay with that because I don't think there can really be any progress uh Beyond The Dilemma that Richard is talking about as long as the Democrats uh are really inow to sort of pretend to be the alternative uh to the Republicans and uh I think that if this election ends the way I expect it to be and the Democrats will lose not only the presidency but the Congress and the Senate as well that will mean that it's not possible for them to win an election again uh without somehow uh moving away from their right-wing uh basis uh all of there there have been some plls that the newspapers don't talk about and that is that uh Bernie Sanders was the most popular um politician within the Democratic party suppose that there would have been a PR presidential primaries like every other part's had for the last 100 years suppose people had earlier said you know Biden is really scile we can't let him run again we've got to let the voters choose uh who an alternative will be Harris could not have won a single state just like uh in 2016 uh she uh and Bernie Sanders would have won the Democrats said we know that's going to happen we would rather lose with Harris just than win with Bernie just as in 2016 they would rather lose with Hillary than win with Bernie so that shows how the rottenness of the choice that's put before the American people because the election is not going to be about the problems of American militarism and the Empire and uh the domination of Wall Street that uh Richard and I have been talking about on your show for the last few months let me Richard do you want to add something Richard yes I want to throw uh an idea out for you and for Michael um to play with and here I'll be I'll be blunt so I won't be able to develop the the nuances of this a very short time ago the head of Apple Mr cook went on a trip to China he's made many trips to China but and more than one this year but he recently made one and it was crystal clear by the very warm reception he got and by his own very enthusiastic positive commentary on [Music] China that and here comes the jump that there are sections of America's most important biggest businesses that do not want a war with China they do not want this conflict they have become the giant successes they have been because of what China enabled them to do they know it they don't want to lose that there is nothing to substitute for what they get out of China which to be blunt is cheap labor and the biggest expanding Market on Earth to give those up is to risk their entire business operation okay now at some point especially where Mr Trump to win these people are going to possibly begin to think like Michael just spoke they're going to say these two parties are a disaster they are involving us in one deadend War or conflict after another and while it may be good for the military industrial complex we are after are all a bigger section of this economy than they are we the high-tech Industries we all the rest of the economy other than the military industrial complex at which point an immense conflict breaks out in the ranks of capitalists those who want to cut a deal with China and the bricks work out how we Live and Let Live one another on this planet who who don't want War and who don't want nuclear war and who don't want Jake Sullivan type people playing around that problem versus the military industrial complex and those who are one over by them it will be a split bitter conflict over Which Way American foreign policy goes it will be decided in Congress and so each of those two Wings will begin to appeal to the public for Mass support to their two different programs go the way we are saber rattling down the road or go in the alternative Direction work out a deal with Russia China the Arab world and so on at the expense of the West including Israel Western Europe and so on no question do we do that or do we and pardon my my humor have a capitalist peace movement Alliance which actually wins why because the peace movement can be the most popular base and that wing of the capitalists will fund the creation of that base into a voting majority if I'm right that's the next step of American political life which will burst on the scene because of the crazy things that are going to happen next in a in in Ukraine and in in the Middle East no matter who wins that will for for the the the thing I've just described which will either happen or it won't but it is a possible scenario that has come into my mind as I watch the uh the lunacy and and just one last thing I know you mentioned we might discuss it but if Mr Trump has to carry through the notion of T putting tariffs on everything which is what he said he is going to do uh with the uptick in inflation I don't know if you saw today's data the the inflation is back the uh the but that's nothing compared to what would happen if you actually did that tariff stupidity uh and and I also begin to think that the United States is beginning to recognize what somebody ought to call the hegelian moment of American politics and here it is the culmination of the Cold War and the years since that aimed to isolate socialism isolate Russia isolate China is reaching its peak which takes the form of the isolation of the United States yeah if you isolate everybody else and you end uping them Al together and you're isolated that's exactly right so this is a new kind of isolation that's in the past the isolationists were always against that War uh today the uh the you're saying uh the opposite the isolation have led to war yeah because the war is is a self- delusional gesture it's the person who is losing the battle who well I'll give you an example from the Ukrainian War the ukrainians are losing and they take their best troops and invade an an unimportant corner of Russia I mean that's pure symbolic gesture that can't work and it is now coming to its pathetic end as anybody who paid attention would have presumed it would that's an act of desperation as would be sending missiles Into the Heart of Russia which Mr zalinski wants to do he's desperate which I understand that he's desperate and these are the behaviors of a desperate character but they're not to be taken seriously on their face value he calls it a victory plan that's hysterical well what you have no plans at all let Al let alone a vict your plan is how to get out of that country in time when the troops arrive that's the only plan left for you when Michael do you want to add something yeah what uh why on Earth would uh zalinski have uh in invaded the K area the answer is uh it's all about the narrative he didn't invade to win the war he invaded because he thought that that would convince uh somehow the uh egotistical uh narcissistic uh American uh cold Warriors that uh th this enables a narrative to be said Ukraine has fought back Russia invaded us we're going to invade uh it uh there better be a peace and if there's a peace uh will there'll have to be a ceasefire uh and Russia cannot continue uh to mop up and continue the plan that Putin has announced of dentifying the Ukraine and protecting itself uh against uh NATO so uh it's the fight over the narrative and nobody uh on this show you know when uh Richard and I naturally are saying what is in the capitalist interest what is in America's interest what is in foreign Count's interest and uh there uh there are people who are not interested in America's interest they're interested in their own interests and uh to defend their to distract people's attention from the American national interest if uh there was an American election uh they have to have a different narrative a narrative in which they're protecting the weak Democratic ukrainians against the authoritarian Uh Russian Invaders who are uh not going to stop at Ukraine but are just going to continue to March West uh over over the rest of of Europe it's all somehow there's a belief on the American cold Warriors that they can create a narrative that will convince people to somehow uh uh find the fight between good and evil as seen depicted by the CIA and the American Military uh is more important and certainly uh confused people is what the real world's fight between good and evil between civilization and barbarism is and uh uh I think the ideas that Richard and I have said on your show is that uh the new force of civilization uh that is taking place uh in isolation from the West is um the global majority and the bricks and the barbarism is the attack on uh uh the bricks the US NATO attacks trying to preserve this uh uh defunct American power that is only predatory not productive only extractive not productive and not leaving living standards only polarizing not democratizing so I think that this is uh you could look at the the these military Wars that are going on is Wars between two narratives of what is good and what is evil what is black and what is white and when it comes Richard and Michael when it comes to the these two conflicts in the Middle East and in Ukraine we want to see what's the difference between Democratic party and Republican party Donald Trump in his recent interviews he was just talking that we I'm going to put an end to the conflict in Ukraine in 24 hours as he put it out and in the Middle East he said I'm not interested in a direct conflict in a direct war with Iran JD Vance in his latest interview he mentioned the same thing that we are not Israelis are trying to drag us into a war with Iran but we are not interested in going to war with Iran this is one side of the story on the other hand Donald Trump is talking about that Mike Pompeo Nikki Haley Tom Cotton these people gonna be in his administration if he wins here is what Mike Pompeo said on Fox News specifically about the conflict in Ukraine he says done Donald Trump doesn't know what he's talking about I don't know what he's talking about um I do know that we were able to deter bladimir Putin from doing precisely what he did invade Europe um he's killed innocent Ukrainian civilians we that didn't happen on our watch right Putin takes a fifth of Ukraine under President Obama not an inch while I was Secretary of State and then goes at it again as soon as we leave I'm so I'm convinced we could have convinced Vladimir Putin not to have done this putting it back in the box is going to require real American seriousness real American leadership that prepar to help the ukrainians do the things that they need to do yeah put him back in the box it seems that there they can do whatever they just desire to do Richard jump in please well it's it you know this is this has deep roots in the United States very deep roots going back to our start as a colony the Puritans the this way of thinking that that the world is to be captured by a great struggle between good and evil this obliterates all the complicated relationships that make things happen it reduces it and they know that they know that but we don't we don't tell our people what the what the issues are we don't explain we have no history of it we barely do it in the University with the tiny minority of people that even bother to go to the university and the tiny minority of them who actually read and listen to what goes on I spent my life in the University I did the best I could but I'm not crazy I know what my students did and didn't do and I learned what holds them back from learning to give you an example there's this need to demonize the enemy every everything is about Mr Putin I got news for you like any other leader he is very much shaped by the situation he's in he's not some free actor somebody like a devil in the notion of God versus the devil somebody who has no constraints obviously God if he has all powerful should have gotten rid of the devil but he couldn't to guess something happened that made the devil survive the God and we know the stories oh we can learn them when we're little and so we have these great actors who are acting out their intrinsic social role but there's no analysis of why they do what they do so everybody is free to define the devilishness so for Mr Pompeo and he's not original in this uh by the way he's not original anything else either uh he has picked up the story that Mr Putin wants to March to the ocean that's right instead of Ukraine he'd like to have a rebellion of the French and the British and the Germans and the Italians and the Scandinavians all together he could try to he can barely control Ukraine what a joke that he could control the others who are better armed better equipped than the Ukraine ever were I mean this is this is so silly that it works and it works because it touches the good and the bad the good and the bad and when people reason like that it never stops that's why Mr Pompeo can then seamlessly go from the bad Putin and the good us to the bad us and the good us the bad Democrats and the good Republicans we could we're God the Democrats are a junior devil that's why they made a deal with the senior devil and this is childish this is reading the comic book instead of reading the book about which the comic book was written this is a childish substitute for real politics that's why clowns like Pompeo and Nikki Haley I mean please help us there's nothing there nothing there is a finger in the air which way is the political wind blowing among the mass media and takes her queue and I don't mean to pick on her she's no worse or no better than Mr Pompeo this this is a game inside the United States you paint your enemy as the devil for Maga supporters I don't know um kamla Harris or the others they're Devils they talk like that they're at least honest enough they talk like that and for the Democrats you hear that Mr Trump and all of his people are immense dangers to democracy look at the language that's why you don't hear much about this or that program what's the point you can't have an anti- capitalist program because then the media will destroy you in 10 minutes so you fasten on other issues where you're allowed to say something like abortion or gun control or immigration and you pick the and you and then what do you do you picture your enemy as a devil so the people who don't agree with you on immigration are evil people abetting the invad of the that's the way they talk but listen as with any therapy what we're doing is we're trying to understand what's behind the language there's no point in dismissing the language the languages our clue the clue here is that you allowed yourself and you had the luxury in the United States by the very diff from Europe in the beginning by the importance of the Atlantic and Pacific Ocean separating you to cultivate a notion that you really are in God's chosen country that's part of why there's a vibration with Israel they too think they're in God's chos they're the chosen people and they're in the chosen country and the chosen book The Bible said it was their real estate not those other people's real what is going on here and so you've had this way of thinking and now the chickens are coming home to roost because this way of thinking we are the exception you know American exceptional we God sh God created us our politicians have to be talking to God all the time politicians in European countries don't do that if they stood up and said I'm talking to God that'd be a Patty wagon come to pick them up and take him to the sanitarium nobody wants to hear this and these are countries that have the same Christian religions that you have here but you can't do it here because everything is infused and now the the D numon the chicken's coming home to roost you're killing yourself you're destroying Yourself by turning that language onto one another and now we are a country split in which each side thinks it's God versus the devil and they're going to destroy each other the Soviet Union didn't disappear because another country overwhelmed it the Soviet Union imploded that should worry people as the politics of America becomes unlivable are we headed down that way that's a conversation we ought to have have but of course we won't each side will see the devil in the other not in the relationships because if you understood that this is a language game you'd have to ask the question why are we playing the game but the people that we're talking about Harris Trump and all the others they are so into that game they can't see it as a game the great Phil philosopher Lish wienstein understood and wrote RS of material about the games language is a game and that metaphor is really helpful because you can then maybe take a step back and ask yourself why are these language games so powerful or to use Michael's language why is this narrative the one that's embraced by people that's the first step to getting out of this hole is to understand that you're in a hole just like going to Alcohol Anonymous they require you to say I'm an alcohol you have to begin recognizing where you are if you're ever going to get out of there Michael what does it mean to be a devil it really means the other uh and you mentioned uh the and American uh American settlement itself the other at that time were the Native Americans what did you do you want to put them on reservations so people who uh I think the strategists the neocons uh and militarists at the top of the planning pyramid in the United States uh may not think themselves of Good and Evil that's just to tell the religious uh uh sector of the voters but uh what they think think of is uh the other are people who do not submit to us the people who want to maintain their own autonomy so just as he wanted to put the Native Americans on reservations America's policy is in words uh that you almost said literally put Russia back on the reservation uh isolated put China on a reservation when you put everybody on a reservation you have a situation very much like when you put uh many of the Native Americans on reservations all of a sudden they found that oil was under these reservations and all of a sudden you found uh that they were very rich uh what do you do with that well then all of a sudden you want to grab them and I think the coch brothers made I'm told made all of their money uh stealing oil from the Native American uh reservations and uh they were about to be exposed by the government when uh President Clinton uh had the affair with his assistant uh and her dress and so the deal was okay we won't impeach Clinton get rid of him if uh you don't uh move against uh the Coke brothers and that was a turning point certainly in American politics well America's isolated uh almost all of the global majority as we said earlier uh we put it on a reservation they find that they have oil uh they're trying that enables them to be independent they've also found that they're immune from uh many of the uh Western laws from the rules-based order and can make their own uh uh International uh law order and uh I guess for the American reservations it's we can have gambling casinos uh and clean up uh uh with the frustration of the Americans so uh the I think the higher uh the planners who are really behind uh making this aggressive policy uh that you talked about uh think the only thing that uh that we can do is prevent this is a war against anyone who is trying to maintain independence from the American unipolar World Order and of course that means everybody's the enemy well they're not going to say this is their strategy to the American voters they're just going to say this is uh good versus evil uh uh US versus the foreigners and it's uh the all of a sudden what has catalyzed the recognition on certainly the global majority is exactly what's happening uh in Israel the fact that they say h God gave us this land and we must exterminate everybody all the enemies they're all amalo uh and uh that it it's a a a war for the destiny of civilization and all of a sudden the rest of the countries of the world saying well when the Americans are coming in and have the uh uh National Endowment for democracy sponsor regime change and color revolutions uh they're going to try to get one of us uh to to die to the last Ukrainian to die to the last Georgian if they could if they could have been able to to uh overthrow the Georgian government yet again uh they they would like Georgia to fight to the last Georgian against Russia who which of the bricks can they pick on next to fight to the last of their citizenry uh against America cannot fight militarily it has to somehow convince some one of its uh designated opponents to fight among themselves this is the kind of crazy uh locked in diplomacy that we're in yeah let let let me add just to take Michael's Point another step to make sure people get it the whole world is watching what Israel is doing in Gaza okay now what Americans have to understand is what's going through the minds of all of those people around the world the United States is funding and arming what the Israelis are doing in order to hold on to its influence through Israel in that part of the world everyone is wondering will there be another country neighbor of mine another Latin country another Middle Eastern country another Asian or South Asian country another African country that will be chosen by the United States to play that role over there will they may be armed and are we dealing here with the risk of this happening to us and they're terrified by it and they're worried that the United States is in its Empire decline going to reach out if the bricks keeps picking up more and more Muslim countries it's got most of them you know if it's going to pick up the remaining Muslim countries and the United States is identified everywhere as the enemy of the Muslim countries will the United States pick one of them make that its Ally and have that be the Israel of another place and that is becoming part of the mentality of the United States which is looking for those countries was very upset when ner a small country in the middle of Africa basically said you have to leave Americans and brought into Russians okay this is for them a terrible sign of where things can go like the election in Georgia or a hundred other elections or movements or problems and those countries are worried now not only that they might happen but the Israelis are showing them how far the United States is willing to go to protect its friend in the area whoa that's a little different from Ukraine that's another issue similar but this is different this is going into an area with a bunch of different countries making one your bosom buddy and then enabling it to become a dominant wow wow and are there people in many countries who would like to play that role for the United States you bet is that already happening I would guess so and what that does to everybody else is to begin to do the worst nightmare of the United States which is that the world decides that there is one number number one Rogue country and it's us not North Korea they're not endangered by North Korea they're endangered by the United States and at that point where are they going to go as there's a burgeoning conflict between the United States or the G7 on the one hand and the bricks you're watching in slow motion the decline of an Empire when when the Roman Empire collapsed for a hundred years the conversation in Rome was about The Barbarians a language I believe Michael used a few minutes ago the bar you viewed the people moving in on the Empire the Frankish people in what we call France now the Gish people other part of France and so on they weren't Barbarian but they were for the Romans because they were the manifestation of the decline of an Empire that couldn't stop the decline we ought to read those books about the end of Rome they are wonderful insights into What's Happening Here Yeah here is what you you've mentioned you two mentioned that the situation in Middle East is far more complicated here is what the foreign minister of Saudi Arabia recently said about the conflict in Gaza in in the West Bank and Israel normalization with the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is not just as risk it is off the table until we have a resolution to Palestinian statute but I would say more than that I would say that it is not just the issue of normalization with the kingdom that is at risk I would say that the security of the region as a whole is at risk if we do not uh address uh the rights of the Palestinians if we do not find our way to a pathway uh that leads us to a Palestinian State because that's the only way we can ensure uh that we can focus on the future that we can focus on cooperation that we can focus on integration I so I would hope uh that the uh leadership of Israel sees that it is not just the right thing to do it is not just the moral thing to do it's not just the just thing to do to give the Palestinians their rights uh and their state it is also in the security and strategic interest of Israel to do so uh and that's I think up to them to decide yeah his do you see any sort of understanding in terms of because when we talk about Saudi Arabia in the Middle East we know that how close they are to the United States right now and how do you find the the way that he's talking about the conflict in the Middle East Michael do you think 10 years or maybe 30 years or 75 years too late there's no way there can be a Palestinian State alongside Israel anymore the way that Israel has structured uh the whole region is uh as a prison camp and how can you a state is supposed to have its own authority to power uh the only way you can have an A A Palestinian state is for uh Netanyahu to kill all the Palestinians except maybe 200 and it'll put these 200 on a reservation and call that the Palestinian State uh there's no way in which Palestinians and uh Israelis can live because the Israelis say the Palestinians are not human beings we have to make uh Israel for the human beings only we can't have uh non-human beings or The Barbarians anywhere around us this is a fight uh for the death for them and certainly pomp says uh yes we're all for that because when this fight is for the death Jesus will come and he will take all his two followers up to heaven Pompeo is this religious nut uh on top of all of his craziness uh so I don't I don't think there's any hope for a Palestinian State anymore the question is what are you going to do with the PE the Israeli the zionists who live in Israel how are you going to get them out of Palestine they cannot live in Palestine if there is to be a Palestinian state or if there are going to be any living Palestinians left where are you going to put uh the the zionists where can they go in the world yeah the way I read uh his statement is the way I read what s Arabia does in the world and for me it is a wonderful case are hedging their bets first of all Saudi Arabia is in the bricks so we know that they the United States is not encouraging anyone to become a member of the bricks it is encouraging everybody not to do so okay I'm I'm sure I don't know but I'm sure that they encourage the sis not to do that well that didn't work the sis went ahead and did it every country's leadership is now now assessing what has to change in their foreign policy to take into account that the global economy is now split between a larger and a smaller group of Nations and I mean larger and smaller in terms of total wealth or total output GDP whatever you want to use all right the bricks is now the larger of the two it wasn't before the two lines crossed in 2020 and the gap between them is getting wider each passing day and that means if you're a company where you Source your inputs has to be rethought because you're you're going to crisscross this new Global situation if not directly then indirectly which can be just as devastating you have to re reconsider where your exports are going to go you're going to have to reconsider your your credit situation you're going to have to consider who to insure with what banks to use how to split your accounts so that you're not maybe too much in one or the other everybody is Shifting and in that shifting the West loses what it had before and the bricks gain relative to what they more or L I may be some exception but the and the Saudis are busy doing that and there's a dance here and the dance is don't don't make the adjustment too quick because the United States might then do to you what is happening to Palestine or Lebanon or Syria or Libya or fill in the blank right so you you can't go too quick but you better not not go either because that's very dangerous and becoming more dangerous with every step yesterday the United States announced more sanctions a whole new bunch of sanctions on companies and countries that are allowing other companies to function there because those companies also sometimes do business with uh uh Russia O Okay uh most of the countries on Earth are doing business with Russia and more of them will be in the years ahead they're facing sanctions the United States ironically keeps forcing decisions that are going to go against them so you there's a dynamic here that feeds on itself and that cannot cannot help the United States that's why the word rogue Nation because the rest of the world is slowly coming to an awareness that out of its own desperation at being a declining Empire which is always hard for the Empire that's in Decline it had was terribly difficult for the British was terribly difficult for the Dutch before them uh the French didn't go quietly you know they're still Trum trying to hold on to bits of of their empire so it's very hard but what the world is observing is that the American Empire partly because it was a global Empire more than anybody else even the British had achieved the United States has those 700 bases around the world it really was a global Empire because that makes it that much harder the United States is busy with its defensive ures is actually making the problem worse if I could pick a dangerous metaphor if you've ever taught swimming one of the lessons you teach a swimmer is if you're having trouble swimming don't flail your arms around because it'll make it worse for you it'll make it harder for someone to save you it'll make don't do that someone ought to tell the United States that's what your doing you're going to go down faster further because of your refusal to deal with what your situation actually is and the desperate ways you're holding on yeah well you mentioned the Roman Empire before as a decline and there a number of differences uh many of the Romans kept uh def uh leaving the Empire to join The Barbarians because they thought the barbarians were more civilized uh I can imagine American Engineers German Engineers others uh immigrating to Russia China and the bricks countries where uh they want to do that that's one similarity but also uh many of the Germans began to become the Roman Empires uh there were where there were fights uh among uh rival uh Roman Empires and they would hire the Germans as their troops and the Germans ended up as the popes well the equivalent there would be if uh American expanding to China and Asia uh and the bricks uh if there was some kind of reciprocal uh investment here that somehow the bricks would uh invest in the United States which is what the United States is trying to get Le Taiwan and other countries to do I don't see that happening because there's there's so much of a hatred uh against the The Barbarians here that really didn't exist in Rome by about the 4th Century uh you had Roman philosophers saying well The Barbarians have many qualities that are more civilized than are in their own our own country they're have a more balanced economy they have mutual Aid uh they don't have other kind of financial oligarchy it's sort of they the the Romans began to idealize an original Society where people were equal and mutually supportive uh today would call that communism uh and they began to try to uh develop that that became in a way Christianity but as that developed the uh Center of uh the Roman Empire moved northwards it moved northwards through like to Milan then it moved up into the Germanic tribes and finally uh it moved to the new Rome Constantinople the whole Center changed I don't know where the American uh Empire could somehow move its Center to certainly not Europe because part of the real fight against bricks began with the fight of America against uh Europe against Germany and against any potential European industrial rival so uh those parallels through them can't exist America has sort of bossed itself in it it can't sort of immigrate to at least by as a government to foreign countries uh if if America were like Rome developing Christianity it would develop socialism as you put it at the beginning of the show politicians who represented actual voters and what's good for the economy uh and then this would become an ideal that would lead to a world a universal world it will uh I think you said earlier there there's going to be a real crisis first and uh what you're describing is this positive potential outcome uh will will be triggered by the absolute disaster that's going to be caused either by the war Monger uh Harris or by Trump and his uh tariff disasters and his economic libertarian disasters for the United States that will somehow lead you'd think the large corporations to say we're boxed in here we can't go to the bricks countries because of the sanctions that have been spurred by this uh nationalist fervor against the other uh there's nothing we can do except to create a new society and uh this would I guess would be America's version of Christianity and of course that was poisoned soon enough uh by the fifth century uh by St Augustine that and S of Alexandria that completely uh destroyed the Christian uh feeling that came out of Rome but that that a revulsion against inequality spread throughout the near East it spread to Persia it spread to other near Eastern countries it spread it was absorbed by Islam that came up so uh we're going to see some kind of a transplantation of what was America into other parts of the world but it's almost impossible to see how this will occur right now except beginning with a a trickle of immigration of people who cannot live in uh today's version of Rome uh abroad but then uh it will lead you'd think to some uh powerful groups acting in their own self-interest and the at least the American power elite or uh not quite like uh Romans landlord creditor class trying to inept the whole other country and impoverish it and lead to feudalism uh and that that's really the question is the American economic model going to lead to Neo feudalism or is it going to lead to something better that would actually be in principle the same kind of rules of civilization that the bricks countries are trying to create I think the very nature of this conversation is telling you we are more evidence of a declining Empire we are beginning to grope around for either historical models or theoretical extensions of things we see now to begin to imagine where this can all go and that's already a sign that people are looking there's an enormous revulsion here in the United States against the level of inequality that we have one of the reasons neither presidential candidate goes near there is because it is so dangerous the people who are the the tiny minority at the top are prepared and willing to spend a lot of money to keep that conversation bottled up not public not pervasive they are very interested in not having that conversation go because they are so isolated at the top of the pyramid with all that wealth I mean if you have $200 billion and most people you know living paycheck to paycheck you got a problem you need to keep the lid on the ideologies of your people you need to control the politics otherwise the sheer numbers will overwhelm you and I suspect we're going to see all kinds of movements against the inequality questioning the system in all kinds of ways including a resuscitation of the old marxian and socialist and that's gon to come back as it has in the past you know the comment that that's all behind us is silly that deserves the same answer that the Mark Twain gave when he read his own obituary in the Hartford current he wrote the letter to the editor saying the rumors of my death have been greatly exaggerated you know the same is true for all of these other ideas you know the worker Co-op is not a new idea it's been around for thousands of of years but it's going to H it is already having a Renaissance in part because there is a concrete example visible all over the place of people who are getting together in a in an Enterprise to produce a good or a service and not organizing it in the capitalist way with an owner operator at the top and a mass of dependent servants excuse me employees below that's being a problem now and there are alternatives being groped around to see whether they might they might fit but I think everything starts with understanding that we're doing that if you ask that question then you don't have a war in the Ukraine you don't you work things out you take into account the security needs Russia says it has the security needs Ukraine says they have and and work something out that could have and should have been done it had been done for years before it could continue we can work that out and the same is true in the Middle East I understand what Michael is saying and I think the Israelis have made horrible mistakes in now creating a population whatever its animosity was before can you imagine with me what the feelings of the Palestinian people must now be after a year of that kind of bombardment I mean it is I mean it's it's beyond so I understand why Michael can't possibly imagine how these two people could live together given what has happened now and remember every time the the Israelis had a war with the Palestinians they explained and Justified the violence they used on the grounds that they had to do something that would prevent worse violence well well it didn't work we have that worse violence much worse violence and to say now it has to be done to pres prevent worse violence can't do that anymore you've run out of that one that one's dead so you got to come up with something else the Israelis will have to face that one way or another and there are enormous divisions inside Israel so it's not as though there's all unanimity about what they're doing it's a very particular government I understand the people have supported their government doing that and there is no way around that but there are also big splits and differences that also should be kept in mind in terms of what the future may bring but to go back to the way you open Today's Show Nema look at how many of the issues we've brought up you Michael and me and even if you don't agree with all of them of course not but these are the issues that could have been and should have been raised as this country at this moment in its history chooses its leadership what do you say about a country that can't talk about that we have one president I'll end that war in a week that's not serious that's that's childish junk what is is that that doesn't solve anything you're not going to deal with you know even if you thought you could do it the the the whole of European politics has been turned on its head by this war in Ukraine the leadership the center right leadership of Europe is committed to fighting in Ukraine it will be looking totally ridiculous if Mr Trump ends this war and that will be brought and what's going to happen then the left is already preparing to make this point in France and they already are the biggest party there and I'm talking a left that is Old Well organized knows how to function theoretically sophisticated present throughout the society and I could go on talking about the German or the Italian or even the British so you're not in a position you may think you are Mr Trump May well I'll end a war you can't do that that's not available to you the the implications of this war will play themselves out and you're not you you'll you'll be even less able than you might have been to shape it because you don't even talk about it you don't you don't even allow your Society to engage in a discussion that might come up with some new ideas that might come up with an idea a plan for how to do you know we're just three people I really believe in democracy with a small D I want more people involved in these conversations and then we'll get better answers if we do that you made a very funny comment Richard suppose indeed that uh Donald Trump uh made uh could make an agreement to say well the whole Ukraine war has been a mistake look uh we we've lost Russia has absolutely wiped out most of the uh Ukrainian uh not only population but also society and let's uh arrange some kind of Peace that's all a mistake well where does this leave Germany and the rest of Europe uh it's this mistake is not a for for them it's not reversible a few week week ago Volkswagen said we're no longer really a viable company in the way that we've operated in the past we're going to uh for the first time we're going to cut back employment uh we're going to cut back sales uh we're not able to compete in electric cars with China so unless we put huge tariffs on on China uh which will uh reverberate throughout the German economy you know we're going uh the German industrialists who uh the small uh mediumsized firm the middle uh German firms have been they're going out of business and once the firm is out of business it can't be remade if Volkswagen goes out of business it can't be re remade uh Putin has said that if any uh missile made by the German Rin missile rhin metal firm uh ends up in Russia uh Russia will not hesitate to bomb the rhin metal Factory so there all of these uh the America has created irreversibilities for Europe while maintaining its all Freedom uh its own freedom of action for instance the grabbing of the uh Russian for 300 billion in foreign exchange that was Europe grabbing it uh hard hardly any uh was in the United States for the first time Europe has uh cut its uh ties with all of these countries we've talked about just America versus these countries but America uh Europe has SP collateral damage in all of this and uh I think you're right the you'd think the hope would be the French left and sah V connects uh leftwing party split off from Del Linka in Germany and but so far it's the nationalistic uh parties that have not exactly the pro labor parties that have been grabbing power in Europe but any party that calls itself socialist is usually the far right uh thing you know whether it's the British labor party uh or the macron's party in Germany uh in in France or the others so we've created a mess that looks almost unextractable how can you extricate yourself I can't figure out uh any it's not foreseeable right now it's a quandry and a quandry a problem has a solution but a quandry doesn't have a solution what is going to happen I would add I know we're running out of time but I would add that it isn't surprising I mean since the second world war it has we've had this cold war or the legacy of the Cold War that has systematically demonized the left the Communists are the great danger uh the Socialists are fellow Travelers of the Communist and therefore more or less equally dangerous and on and so when the Great consensus of the center right center left begins to dissolve when you don't have yet another American election with a Democrat like George Bush and a Republican like Bill Clinton but you have something odd weird and different like Trump it's going to be from the right the people who are going to break this mold this consensus that is now so stale the people who have the idea this is unbearable are going to come from the right because that's what we have as a society cultivated all this time we expunged the the left the left were impossible so the first breakthrough will be on the right I think that's not surprising the left will now have to understand that the time has come when you're going to have to do on the left something like what the streem right has done on their side and the middle the middle as the Great British Yates said doesn't exist anymore the middle is Vanishing the middle class we all know has been eviscerated now the middle perspective of politics is also on the way out what you have is a vast Mass 80 or more percent of the people who feel cheated who feel hurt could add to the story Michael told about um Volkswagen the detail which is no detail that the largest Union in Germany is striking Volkswagen and that's a bitter strike that's going to and I I urge you to take a look at the Boeing workers who used to be very docel who have been on strike and who have now rejected by overwhelming majority two of the contracts offered to them you know and Boeing is a member of that military industrial complex big big time they can't manage their problems by the way the Chinese are producing lots of military aircraft that too is going to become a a serious problem for the United States I think the left ironically agreed to kamla Harris and here I'm talking about Bernie they agreed because they saw what was happening on the right as a great threat and they're right it is but the answer to it should have been Bernie not kamla Harris they should have understood that they need dramatic powerful images of change when Mr Trump gets up and says to the suffering American working class I'm going to protect you from the immigrants and from the Chinese that's a good Big Image in terms of economics it's silly it's a joke it's not serious it's fake well who cares it's a power what we need is Bernie to stand up and say we don't need billionaires in 10 minutes we can pick 2,000 billionaires and announced to them there's a wealth tax anyone over10 billion that's it you don't have it anymore it's over comparable things like that would have given the people a chance to say wait a minute I am willing to Desert the conventional parties like recent polls show Americans interested in third parties but Bernie would have then given them something on the left comparable to I'll protect you from the immigrants I'll protect you by taking the money from the billionaires which they're all jealous about anyway I can do that and I can make a new deal here's what it'll look like everybody will have a job as a right there will be no that's the drama that would have overwhelmed Mr Trump instead she did the usual of Center I'll do this I'll help working people there those are genuine but they're small they're old they're precisely the kinds of things that Democrats have always done which is why they've never changed the basic trajectory of inequality in this Society but they didn't understand it they were hesitant if kamla Harris loses it may be a very important time to make make that point well this is the problem that I mentioned at the very beginning uh when I said the Democratic party role is to prevent the left and to co-opt the left uh two days ago uh Bernie gave a whole attack on the American working class an attack on the pacifists saying You must support Pamela Harris AOC his popular follower gave an attack on the working class an attack on American labor ATT back on the pacifists you must support AOC you must support the war in in Ukraine the function of the democratic party is a quicksand uh that just absorbs these people and pretending to be we are the alternative to the rightwing they uh will take the people who would like to be on the left like Bernie was when he joined the Trist in 1962 uh and just sort of absorbed him and made a deal they told Bernie we will'll put you on a some committees you can do all the Talking you want you simply cannot act uh we want you to talk the more you talk people will think uh that somehow the Democrat ha Democratic party has a potential where uh by absorbing you we were crushing the potential people are now disgusted with you burning they're disgusted with AOC they're disgusted with you supporting the war they're disgusted with you supporting Wall Street and supporting the Democratic party uh saying Dre Harris uh and her right-wing not Center left these this a right-wing po party with a leftwing rhetoric to prevent any left from developing in the United States so in a way the function of the democratic party is to sterilize the left and uh that that I think was the message that Jill Stein was given uh she's not only anti-war she's against the pretense that there is a two-party state that there is an alternative and that the Democratic party is different from the Republicans uh in any way except for its uh trickster rhetoric just to share with you here is a an article in Gallup that shows 63% of American are in favor of the third party in the United States and that shows everything but it's not there for the time being thank you so much Richard and Michael for being with us today great pleasure as always thank you very much and I'm very glad to be part of this and I learn and I appreciate it very much yeah I I think we're redefining the quandre in a way that I don't uh nobody else is really talking about that's our job that's our job thank you so much bye bye bye byebye goodbye
