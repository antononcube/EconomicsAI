when you look at Europe right now and you see Macon was talking about sending troops NATO troops and French troops to Ukraine to fight with Russia and we know that German bundes officials were discussing attacking Crimean Bridge with German Taurus missiles do you think that we are going toward World War II okay I think we have to begin with facing certain uh realities or at least they seem to be realities to me after two years a little bit over two years of War uh the Russians are winning and the ukrainians are losing any attempt to pretend otherwise shows a level of self- delusion or straight out dishonesty either of which is an unacceptable quality in a serious political leader over the last two years as the Russians prevailed most of the time one or two times the the ukrainians seemed perhaps to be able to make some sort of response uh but that never lasted very long and it never was um effective in terms of the the broader picture over these two years of Ukrainian loss and Russian Victory the West repeatedly escalated the war most of the time the escalations took the form of threatening and then eventually delivering better harsher weapons missile systems Patriot missile High Mars missiles um underwater drones uh all of that and likewise there was a continuous series of sanctions another weapon against Russia everything and this is important for people to understand everything failed the military escalations failed the financial sanction escalations failed and so what you're seeing is the recognition whether it be by m or Ola Schultz or anybody else a recognition that what they did failed as politicians this puts them in a very difficult position they can either admit they failed and come up with some explanation that exonerates themselves and they will be many who do that or they can deny everything I've just said and pretend it isn't a failure and that they just have to continue so we get the decision by Marron to float the idea of sending NATO troops either by country or by NATO as a whole that's an escalation that's exactly what they said before they agreed to send F-16 fighter jets they said they would never do such a thing before they sent medium range missiles they said they would never do such a thing they keep doing it because they don't want to admit the failure of their policies to this point now I enjoy reminding people of a famous definition that goes like this if you keep doing the same thing even though the results are awful it's a sign of insanity it's a sign that you are unable to recognize what is happening to you it's not a very positive definition not a very positive sign but I think it meets the Criterion the problem with all of these escalations is that each one becomes a bit more difficult in other words a bit larger portion of the population is beginning to be able to see what's going on and therefore look at the government and realize that these are not National issues being resolved these are politicians trying to save their own political situation the European politicians at the top in countries like France Germany England and to a lesser extent Italy and Spain the major countries uh they were all right-wing supporters of fighting Russia in the Ukraine so they are all in the same boat some a bit more some a bit less but it's basically a group of conservative politicians that are now desperately trying to save a very dangerous situation in that way it Bears a singular similarity to Mr Netanyahu and his associates in Israel who are in a very similar situation with their War over there it's a different War different issues but the politicians that have worked themselves into a very bad corner and don't see how to get out and therefore keep doing the same thing hoping for a different result that's this question of Sanity in the realm of foreign policy uh Israel's attack in Gaza has generated more and more opposition in more and more countries by more and more people and yet they keep doing what is generating I that that's a desperate hope that something magical will change all of this and I'm sure they're planning unspeakable horrible events to try to change this but it hasn't worked it just hasn't worked and there ought to be and there will eventually be people who say so in that regard let me make sure that everyone is aware of a remarkable byelection in Britain last week a Critic of the war in Ukraine a Critic even more of the Israeli war in Palestine George Galloway ran in a byelection in Rochdale in England and not only did he win on a program of stopping and reversing British policies in Ukraine and Israel Gaza but what's important is he ran on the Workers Party his own political party he not only won but he got more than twice the number of votes that the conservative and labor party together got I mean this was way more than winning this was a repudiation conservatives and labor have exchanged parliamentary control for the last three quarters of a century if not longer with no serious challenge Here Comes somebody a socialist well known as a socialist but also a Fierce critic not quiet loud and strong and even the person who came in second and I believe there were five candidates was neither labor nor conservative so the the number one and the number two more than half the voters rejected the de the um conservatives and the labor party this is a level of public repute iation of of government that if it weren't for the desperate effort of the major media that are in bed with the leading rightwing of the government if it weren't for that you would see the kind of Amazement being honestly presented what is going on and the the Prime Minister Mr sunak Richie sunak speaking immediately after the vote showing how badly his party had been defeated attacks Galloway because we don't want extremism a very bizarre thing to say when the majority of the people just voted for that quote extremism what are you doing denouncing the mass of people exactly that's what he's doing and Galloway nailed him for doing it in a way that if it weren't these people completely out of touch would be embarrassing okay so what does all of this tell us well several things uh number one the decision of Europe was a decision to [Music] back the leadership of the United States because the United States took the position of helping the coup in um Ukraine several years ago that brought in the zalinski government the key role was there played by newand from the United States and this war was clearly pushed by and supported by the United States there was some waffling particularly by Olaf Schulz in the early hours and days of the war which way would the Germans go but they all lined up behind the United States and it's clear why they did that they are right-wing governments so they would feel comfortable with the United States they didn't want to think about what it might mean if the war was lost they did not calculate the possibility that the war was would be lost terrible terrible political mistakes that they made but now they are going to pay a much higher price than they would have if they had told the United States we're not going to be against you but we are not joining you in you're going to have to work this out in Ukraine yourself you are the United States Russia is our neighbor we cannot afford what you are doing they could have would have been difficult but they could have done it by choosing to go with the United States they are now exposed they are exposed as the junior partner of the United States in a losing War now this is the third time they were a junior partner in Afghanistan and they lost they were a junior partner in Iraq and they lost now they're a junior partner in Ukraine and they're losing again emerging from this what the world has seen is that the the United States's ability to control the world militarily economically and politically is significantly less than they thought it was when I me mentioned before they miscalculated they thought that they could destroy the Russian army in the military way and that they could destroy the Russian economy by the sanctions they could do neither and there's no sign that they're going to do either with or without their escalations it is assumed everywhere in the world I do too that the United States and Europe is not prepared to risk nuclear war because of Ukraine I can assure you as an American that the vast majority of Americans do not know and do not care what goes on in Ukraine but the idea of risking a nuclear war which destroy destroys everything for in Ukraine is one step too many even for the politicians we have now I think and I hope but the effect on the United States here is clear the miscalculations have to be explained why did you miscalculate Russia's vulnerability militarily because you thought that because you dominate in Long Range missiles and nuclear all the other kinds of warfare somehow either wouldn't happen or you couldn't manage them wrong a non-nuclear war with Russia on Russia's border you lose you don't win you lose they have the missiles they have the artillery they have the Manpower you lose do you do you really want an exercise in such law do you really want to risk that if you lose the conventional fighting you might have to seriously think about nuclear for Ukraine stop this is not makes no sense at all and remember the West gained all of the former communist countries from Poland in the north to Bulgaria in the South the whole deal made between uh Roosevelt Churchill and Stalin at the end of World War II has been undone NATO has moved in may have promised not to that's what the Russians say perfectly possible we'll never know but I mean you've gained everything you want to fight a nuclear war about the last pieace Ukraine no no no so you miscalculate you didn't understand but that's not the biggest delusion the biggest and most important delusion was about the sanctions you didn't understand that Russia is a country that has a system of alliances that mean something the alliance with China first of all the alliance with India the alliance with the bricks Nations now including important places like Egypt and Saudi Arabia and so on those countries are now prepared to oppose US policy and help Russia apparently the United States and Western Europe hadn't known that hadn't figured it out hadn't understood it hadn't understood that it might happen let alone that it would happen and there is no end of that cooperation in sight and so Russia's economy is doing fine the ruble is doing fine Russia had a a faster economic growth in the last two years than the United States did Germany is in recession the British economy is a disaster and so on and so on so you have misunderstood the economics of sanction war and you've misunderstood the logistics of military war and that's why you're losing but for the whole world this is a display that the world economy is no longer the play thing the The Tool uh the the slave if you like of the United States as it was I understand it was that way but it isn't anymore every dominant country in the history of the human race has lost its dominance sooner or later and we're seeing it now in the in the world economy I'm not surprised that Pakistan has applied for membership in the bricks my understanding is at least a dozen other countries have seriously begun uh to apply there are new thoughts around the world about Regional blocks that may emerge Spain and Latin America because of the history of their shared language and cultures and so on and so but there is a reorganization of the world economy you and I have spoken about it the decline of the dollar the development of alternative payment system other than the Swift system that the United States organized after World War II and so on and so on and I think Europe to be blunt Europe made a strategic error from which they may not recover there was a time and there was a way that Europe could have become really the third block if you like the United States and its allies China and its allies Europe and its allies it would have required unification real unification in Europe and it probably would have meant Europe welcoming Russia into that operation making them that much stronger and the China Russia all iance that much weaker you know Europe has a larger pop the EU has a larger population and a richer one than the United States so they have they have resources they have wealth yes for 75 years they've been the junior partner of the United States but like everything else that too can change my guess you going to see growing political power in Europe turning against the policies that culminated in Ukraine demand excuse me demanding what we all know because it exists inside Germany inside France inside England there exists a significant political voices already that don't want any of this either from the left because they see the United States or from the right with an anti-immigrant nationalist yeah it'll it'll be complicated but it'll make it more and more difficult for the kind of center right wing that controls now to hold on that's why you see uh efforts by Olaf Schulz or Marron or Richie sunak to do to become more anti immigrant in the hopes of getting weakening the extreme right and then doing what they said about Galloway to attack the left and so on but my guess is their own failures the failure in the Ukraine and now the failure to stop the The Killing in Gaza the failure to get a ceasefire in Gaza these are signs of a weak in that is unmistakable and let me be clear it's not just you know the G7 versus the bricks every country however small however neutral however a small part of one of the other Empire is asking itself the question now which way is the wind blowing these are not courageous people most of us and they they want to be with whoever the winner is and it's no longer clear and in this case it's clear that the United States cannot control Mr Netanyahu you know a country of of you know half a dozen million people what what a country that depends on the United States militarily economically in every way you can't control what these people do you know and that's going to be a terrible problem going forward because these failures are so Grievous they've caused so much loss of life and of of wealth that they're going to be talked about for years to come you know the Israelis are going to have face a world in which they just went from the victims of a terrible Holocaust to the P betrayers of another one not as big not yet but what what what's going on and the United States is going to confront what the entire Arab world the entire Muslim world as the supporter of this what you really want to do this this is what we call in the United States shooting yourself in the foot there's not a smart way to move forward for people who call themselves realists or any other of these terms this is a disaster but for Europe they have the risk that they the politicians in power have bet on the wrong horse they have sided up with the United States at a time when that Empire is going down and let me give you a piece of futurism nobody in Europe is sorry about brexit the Europeans see brexit as the desperate self deluded action of a conservative government trying to hold on to a declining British economy an Empire that's already long gone by focusing people on Europe and so that broke away from Europe and they expelled some Europe the very same thing that they are doing with immigrants from the Middle East and Africa but it's we have an experiment Britain did it Britain broke away and the reaction of most of the rest of Europe was who cares we will build an EU without Britain let Britain be with the United States it'll make Britain that much weaker with the United States that it isn't part of Europe they don't seem to care about that well the same Europeans can do that to the United States they can break away and build on themselves the United States is a bigger player for them but it's not at all clear what they will lose capitalists around the world busily active in many countries they're not sitting there quite quietly they too are calculating where to put their next investment where to locate their next Factory where to build their offices what Market to invest in so they by the decisions they make they reinforce the shifting power that's why American corporations are as enormously important in China as they are the language that says China is doing this or that I have to remind my audiences at least until recently roughly half of the goods coming into the United States from China were produced by subsidiaries of American corporations occup uh operating in China these are capitalist decisions and they don't want to be among the losing parts of the world either and you're going to see arguments in Europe saying we have to do something here to hold on there's already a debate inside Germany and Beyond Germany I should say but particularly in Germany seriously debating whether Germany is now suffering quote deindustrialization because the United States becoming an economic nationalist Society because it can't work with Chinese competition and that's basically what this is the United States says America first that's not just against China they're giving subsidies to companies that are making the decision to leave Belgium and and come to the United States because they want the subsidy and they don't want to be stuck if tariffs get imposed and so the Europeans are watching a situation in which their weakness is becoming exaggerated because they're not playing even if they don't want to be an independent Force they're going to be political voices saying you have no choice if you don't take an independent rad you will be wiped out your factories will move to the United States and your people will be buying Chinese automobiles because they are better and cheaper than you can do here in Europe and you will see your great European car companies Fiat or Reno or vogen having more and more difficulties than they already have me all of this is going on and it points to the fact that what you need in Europe is some basic decisions about genuine unification and a genuine economic program that takes into account the changed World economy and these are political leaders who show no aptitude to understand what I just said or to have a program for it or for that matter to have a program to do anything else they simply are going along as if the disaster that they've been presiding over could and should continue of course the British are now going to leave Richie sunak and the conservative party if you look at the polls in England the victory later this year of the labor party will be overwhelming it's a rejection that a person as odd and bizarre as Donald Trump could be in the position he is is the same kind of thing here in the United States it's a protest against normaly of the sort we've had and Mr Biden is seen as the president who has been doing the same thing for 40 years which is true he has been and so Mr Trump is something new and different and by being outrageous he reminds people that he is new and different and so he gets the vote of people who do not want a continuation of the same now Europe is caught up in this if they don't do something soon and it may already be but if they don't do something soon to deal with this changed reality then it will be too little and too late Richard you talk about Europe the difficulties that Europe is dealing with right now we know that the neocons in the United States they have some sort of agenda for Europe if they really think that Russia and China are their enemy and they have to fight with these two enemies why they're not having a good concept on Europe because when you have some sort of alliance with Europe you have G7 you have NATO and you want to have your allies being stronger and stronger it doesn't seem that they're trying to help Europe the simple question is is Europe better off than before this war in Ukraine started no I think the neocon position about Europe has been pretty consistent for quite a while Europe is to be a wealthy Junior partner of of the United States when when when there's a war that the United States wants to fight it refers to its military as a coalition because there are four Canadians 11 Dutch people 19 French and two polish deserters who join you know in other words this is a joke this is this is a a politics in which the United States is the dominant power uh the great enemy is some of somewhere else preferably not a white European uh country because that creates all kinds of problems remember the United States is a country of immigrants so you can't having a war against Germany or Italy or France that becomes complicated and difficult and we don't handle that very well if you remember in World War II even though the number of Japanese Americans were small we put them in concentration camps for years uh in a in a program that was half racism and half a kind of uh nationalist paranoia so my guess is that the neocons are happy that the Europeans are doing their job they're providing money because they have some and they're providing troops because they have some and they're providing military equipment because they have some and otherwise they're simply a cheerleading supporting the United States in the UN and publicly it allows the neocons to talk which they do as though the whole world I mean it becomes really frightening in the United States when you listen we have once again the phrase the Free World it comes out of the Cold War it was a clever slogan there to distinguish the United States from communist Soviet Union now there is no communist Soviet Union now the Putin is an enemy and a Critic of the Soviet period of Russian history makes no difference we have again a free world and we we just change the name instead of denouncing him for being a communist we denounce him for being an authoritarian what you know we are Al with authoritarians left and right every corporation in the United States we are an economy run by about yeah 1,500 major corporations you know their name Apple General Dynamics General Motors all of that the CEO the Chief Executive Officer of every one of those corporations is an authoritarian leader he's not elect Ed by the people he supervises he can fire them almost at will or certainly with a little effort they all know it he knows it he's an authoritarian leader he has at his disposal billions of dollars with which to buy politicians but we call other countries authorit but no one is anymore fooled by this except the American public which scratches his head I'm not sure your your reader your your viewers know but something like 40% or more of Americans when pulled about Russia do not know that the Soviet Union and Russia are not the same thing they think we're still in the Cold War which is why phrases like the Free World and politicians here talk about the whole world agrees with with us about Ukraine it doesn't the votes in the UN are crystal clear they're not reported here or if reported not discussed in any way that they become General understanded understood knowledge same with Israel and and the Palestinians Americans are shocked to discover which no one expected that the support of young people of black and brown people is tilting more and more toward the Palestinians here in the United States they're the ones out in the street making the demonstrations you know it's it's that wasn't expected Mr Biden is a you know supporter of Israel has been all his adult life he just went out there gave them a cart Blan and assumed that the whole world would support but they don't don't they just don't and I think what you have to begin to see is that the these inabilities to understand there is not only denial of what's going on in there and a determination to see the world the way it was for 50 years or 75 years but there are delusions that flow from that kind of denial that's why you miscalculated the military realities of Ukraine that's why you miscalculated the economic realities of a sanctions and let me talk about another miscalculation a group of sympathizers with Palestinian issues theotis in Yemen make a decision to do something to support so they say we will uh shoot missiles in the Red Sea at ships that have something to do with Israel that are carrying goods to or from Israel something like that um it's a small act it's mostly symbolic it has some consequences because insurers now charge much more to ensure a going through there and then they have to go around the cape Africa and all that but it's still relatively small the United States has Pentagon has flown over 250 bombing raids by American Airlines airplanes joined by a handful of British airplanes of course bombing Yemen it hasn't stopped what the hotties are are doing it hasn't made the Red Sea one bit safer it's a failed policy but they continue the lesson is to every other Arabic or Muslim country sympathetic with Palestine which they all are there are going to be people in those societies who see let's see is there something we can do in our country to be supportive like the hooes because they can't stop us they're too many of us and what they can do doesn't do much and we don't care you cannot mobilize people around the world like this and imagine that you can put out every fire that has been the downfall of every Empire that I know anything about it's called overreach when an Empire tries to keep itself going by doing too many things against too many people in too many different places and it can't do it and then it begins to fall apart and that's what I see I see it in my own country here I see our dysfunction at home which is only going to get worse these divisions that we have are very serious they are not going to be resolved by whoever wins this election nobody should imagine if Mr Biden wins Mr Trump will do what he did after losing last time and if Mr Trump wins it will probably be worse because you will have a mass of people who have no respect no willingness to support no willingness to Toler ra and what is he going to do use the Army too late the the the gaps here are becoming unmanageable and I think people are are recognizing it whether it's a political official in some African country or it's the head of a CEO of a major corporation you want to locate in the United States really you sure why don't you locate in Mexico is is safer wow for most of the last 200 years nobody would have thought that now they do I just read an article about a decision to locate in Mexico not for reasons of tariff and all of that but because it was considered less dangerous so for me I I think that the the neocons are enjoying the end of their regime they're not they can't even hold on to the right wing that they used to be able to keep close relations with the right wing doesn't want the war in Ukraine to continue that's the one holding up the funding they can't get them they certainly can't get the left they certainly can't get young people the argument that saving Ukraine is a great political thing against the evil Russians that's not a durable argument it it gets weaker each day it's still strong but it is weaker than it's ever been and the Vista of an unending War there striking more and more people is crazy you mentioned Victoria nand she was in the Bush Administration in Obama administration in Biden Administration she was one of the key roles of this conflict in Ukraine we've learned that she's stepping down do you think that after Decades of this policy that has failed in Ukraine is this a sign that we can learn from that the United States is changing their policy in Ukraine or it doesn't matter if she's there or not well I certainly don't think it matters whether she's there or not what matters is whether or not the neocon approach that she's been part of for many years Remains the ideological framework of the people who work in the state department and the military and so on they always had their differences it's never been unanimous nobody should think that it has but we'll we'll have to see whether her dep parture it could be part of a change it could be but unless you're an Insider you you really you can't know um what that is I do think that especially if uh Trump wins that for other reasons and in a very confused way they might begin to look for some other policy but I want to stress nothing Mr Trump has said indicates that he understands any of this or that the people around him do you know in America political leaders have to say America is the richest country in the world it isn't it's the most powerful country in the world Maybe by some measures it is but by others it isn't when I explained for give you an idea here when I explain to my American audiences little details like like the population of China is four times that of the United States they can't quite digested it they they need to think that the rest of the world is poor backward weak and the United States is the opposite they you know where you saw that I don't know if you caught the interview that Tucker Carlson did with Vladimir Putin in Russia two or three weeks ago okay when that came out there were a bunch of clips of Tucker Carlson who spent a week or so in Moscow and he took camera with him and he went into the subway and he went into a supermarket and he went around and he was like he was like so many Americans he couldn't get over what he was seeing he marveled here was a supermarket and you could see a supermarket with you know the trays where the meat is kept in a plastic wrap and then he could go and get some bananas and put them in his little cart that he the we have supermarkets like that everywhere in the United States Europe has supermarkets like that everywhere Asia Africa and Latin America more and more have that kind of he couldn't get all look at this he said this is a supermarket like the one I have at home he was amazed and then he went into the subway and it was an interesting moment he looked at the subway and he said my God it's clean it's beautiful it's brilliantly lit it has artwork on the walls and you see all of that and he goes my God I always thought Subways have to look like the one in New York dirty broken full of rats and everything else I live in New York City I I go into the subway I know what they're like and the American commentators who showed these clips were very Ang r at Tucker Carlson they didn't like what he was saying they said no no in a dictatorial authoritarian country they can put together the resources to have showcases like this Subway and I remember thinking they are so desperate that they have become stupid you know if you go to Paris France which has never had a Soviet government or anything like it they have a beautiful subway system my family is French I have been in the Parisian subway system a thousand times in my life it's much better than the American system much quieter much cleaner much more elegant you don't need to have an authoritarian government to have a nice subway system it's a question of your priorities that's all you know but they're so upset that a conservative talk show host Tucker Carlson should have positive things so he's and this is serious the neocons brand people like him an unpatriotic treason like they do with Trump and so on and not for reasons that might be interesting and worthwhile but because he has positive things to say this is childish I'll give give you a final example from my world I'm a professor spent all my life teaching in American universities and I early discovered first as a student and then as a professor that most of my colleagues in economics have studied conventional micro and macroeconomics called neoclassical economic and G in like I have and they've taught that like I have but I also was interested in marxian economics a critical approach so I learned that too they didn't so when they talk in their way I understand because I've had to learn and teach but when I talk using the marxian apparatus which I sometimes find useful they have no idea what I'm talking about and when I've asked them gee that's too bad they say no we are very proud that we and I realize I'm talking to people who think of themselves as intellectuals who think of themselves as Scholars and in their areas they often are but they took a pride in not reading one of the major thinkers of the last 300 years that's a bizarre childishness my teachers could often not answer my questions not because they weren't teachers good teachers they were not because they didn't study the material well they did but when it came to questions that required some knowledge of Marxism they couldn't answer my question because they were proudly avoided picking up the book to read it to learn from it and the fact that half the world took that stuff seriously still wasn't enough for them to learn it so you're dealing with a country whose anxiety about being in control and dominant takes it I we all have a little of that but it it went further in the United States and you're now seeing the cost of it yeah you have your disagreements with Russia but you don't have to be at war with Russia Russia wanted to join NATO not that many years ago stop you could work out all kinds of Arrangements here's an irony we are now at war with Russia in Ukraine we never were at war with Russia during the Soviet period from 1917 to 1989 they were the Great and an evil communism but we didn't go to war now the evil Communists have been thrown out by people who who are proudly anti-communist like Putin and were at War it suggests that the whole story of the Cold War was just a story this is a country that needs to have a dangerous external enemy and if it isn't communism it'll be Global terrorism and if it isn't Global terrorism it's Russia and if it isn't Russia it'll be China and if it f in the blank this is this is a habit of the political mentality and it's only a question now of whether that can survive or whether the dead end it has worked itself into is now too much and it can't solve the problem it could not imagine leaving Afghanistan and turning it over to the Taliban but that's what they had to do they cannot face the fact that the American intervention in the Iraq has mostly benefited the neighboring country of Iran in terms of its power and its Prestige they can't but they do somewhere they know and among them there are enough people who aren't crazy to let them understand you're not winning in Ukraine either yeah they may make terrible mistakes but there is a core of of brain of rationality that I think is going to show itself in the weeks and months ahead Richard just to wrap up this session I want to talk about the pugin's address to nation in which he said bricks share of world economy in purchasing power parody terms will rise to 36.6% by 2028 while g7's share will fall to 27.8 when it comes to this type of comparison do you think at the end of the day that would change the behavior of the United States to have some sort of compromise with China Russia some sort of cooperation not directly no I mean because it's it's already been true the yes you can have debates about purchasing power par and otherwise using exchange rates and so on there are arguments either way the bottom line basically is that around the year 2020 which is now four years old the two lines crossed that the declining relative position of the G7 became the same as the rising uh position of the bricks and that since then the last three plus years that difference has gotten worse in other words the relative output relative GDP of the G7 as a share of global output has been shrinking from around 30% then you can argue some say 29 28 27 while the bricks has gone up from around 30 to 32 34 maybe some will go even higher numbers there no they don't matter all that much uh they are disputable in details that doesn't matter either nor do I think the numbers per se will persuade anyone maybe a few economists who study them no here's how it's going to work the growing wealth of the bricks Nations is going to enable them to do things they couldn't do before and the shrinking relative wealth of the G7 is going to prevent them from doing things they used to be able to do that will agitate these two societies I'll give you quickly examples a small country in Asia or Africa or Latin America decides it desperately needs a quality educational system or a quality public health system and it's going to cost I don't know $6 billion and they would like not to have to pay too much for it can they get Investments can they get loans package they used to have to go to London Paris Berlin Rome or New York they can still go there and they can still try to get it and they may get it but they will likely also now send the delegation to Beijing and to say to the Chinese this is what will you give us and the Chinese will give them a deal I know that because they've been doing it now for years in all those places very successfully and they're going to offer better terms than the west and that country is going to take the better terms not because they like the bricks better but because they don't have the money they need the better deal and they will okay now here comes the contrary example another country somewhere in the world is having a dispute and calls on the American Military to help them and the American Military goes to the president whoever he is and says we can do this but it will cost an extra $30 billion because it's far away it's very expensive so you need to go to Congress to get another $30 billion but the Congress is going to say no we can't we have too many problems at home that people people are angry about they want money for child care they want money for elderly people they want money for our penion system they want money for you can't keep saying no to them and send money into these foreign countries they know what happened in Afghanistan or Iraq or Vietnam or now Ukraine they don't want more of that and they are going to say so and so the president has to turn to his generals he's sorry but they can't do it that's going to happen lots of little moments like that are going to happen you're going to see initiatives by right-wing left-wing Congressional groups pushing for what they want and discovering that if the president wants to do something militarily in the Far East least they can make a deal okay we'll give you the money to go and do something stupid in Taiwan but only if you give us X but he can't give them X because they don't have the money and how's he going to get it he can't borrow more the United States debt is now 30 what is it $34 trillion it's too much it's frightening people so he can't do that he can't raise taxes because that's the that's impossible in American politics so he has to say no this is a new experience they they're not good at that they've been printing money like crazy for the last 25 years because they don't want to raise taxes so they borrow and print the money uh the one part of the government the federal reserve prints the money to lend it to the US Treasury which borrows it to finance domestic spending and foreign spending and everybody understands that will hit a limit no one quite knows what the limit will be but if interest rates stay high then that debt is expensive to carry and that's going to make budget issues very difficult blah blah blah so you you're seeing what I cannot tell you and nobody can is whether this will reach its limits next year or a decade from now that's that's the unknown at this point and that depends on many other variables but I would assure you that the American economy is weaker today than it has been at any point in my lifetime and most of my colleagues left-wingers right-wingers and those in the middle agree we don't agree on why it's this way and we don't agree on what to do about it but the interesting thing is we do agree this is really bad and so when Mr Trump attacks it and we don't like Mr Trump we're uncomfortable when Mr Biden defends that we have a great economy we're also uncomfortable one doesn't know what he's talking about and the other one is simply pretending so he doesn't have to see it and this is not a good sign our problem is not that the two candidates for president are very very old and have serious mental problems which everybody sees that's not our problem our problem is neither of them admits the changed position of the United States neither has a plan for what to do about it and so we continue like the war in in Ukraine doing the same thing we've been doing expecting a different outcome and that's insane thank you Richard for being with us today great pleasure as always to talk with you and learn from you well I really appreciate you're making these videos and sharing them you know it's an opportunity for me and people like me uh to make our case to help people think about this in ways that the mainstream media do not allow and so it's up to folks like you to fill in the missing area thank you so I thank you every bit as much as you thank me my pleasure Richard
