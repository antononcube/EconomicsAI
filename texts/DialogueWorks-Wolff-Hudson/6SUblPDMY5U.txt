but in G20 Summit we had all these superpowers together along with other countries and it's a tremendous opportunity to discuss their differences how did you find it Well I think it it's a strange event because it brings together as you rightly say the major economic powers in the world today that's what it was intended to do but it brings them together at a time when there is momentous huge change going on uh change that was obviously there in the absence of Putin from Russia and Xi Jinping from China so that the two key players in the exploding change happening within the G20 were very obviously and very symbolically absent but what they represent was present you might say in the words of the great French philosopher Luis altuser that the conference was dominated by the presence of an absence to very hegelian understanding the conference was overwhelmed by the contradiction between the G7 and the bricks and yet it had to pretend that it wasn't overwhelmed by that uh and that produced lots of individual photo opportunities for the leaders to look good in their home countries uh it provided opportunity for side meetings mostly private among these people working out their deals but in general it didn't change much it didn't alter the picture in a significant way uh it was interesting but not all that interesting that they could not get an agreement on a strong uh statement against Russia around Ukraine uh that was the what the United States wanted didn't get it by now the United States doesn't get much of what it wants because that's the most important phenomena of the world economy namely the relative decline of the United States so that it is still absolutely an economic superpower but it is a declining superpower and what the G20 should have been if it were serious was an honest recognition of that fact and an attempt by those 20 countries to work out a peaceful way of managing this change then they would have risen to a historic meeting that we would be talking about now we would then have a plan that they might have worked out a plan for how to accommodate the rise of China and its allies and the decline of the United States and its allies how are we going to do that while we struggle with climate change while we struggle with migration of millions of people and how we struggle to avoid uh nuclear and for that matter any other kind of War let me give you another way of understanding it in the emergence of the American Empire what was going on at the same time was the decline of the British Empire one eye Empire declining a new Empire emerging two major wars were fought and many smaller ones but the Revolutionary War in the United States 1776 and then another war between Britain and the new United States in 1812. Britain had to be defeated twice with war before it understood it had to work out a new and different relationship it had to let the colony go it had to watch the decline of its own Empire and in the century that followed a century and a half that followed the rest of the British Empire disappeared as well and the American Empire Rose in that process we had unbelievable War we call these horrible Wars the wars of a declining British Empire struggling against first the United States then the Germans then the Japanese we produced Wars so horrible we call them World War one and World War II at the same time we watched the British fight countless Wars trying to hold on to the British Empire the Fantastic destruction of what we now call India was undertaken by a war that begins with a rebellion of 1857 in India and went for the next Century before Mahatma Gandhi finished the project the first book I ever wrote was about the East African country Kenya and in Kenya in the early 1950s the British went to war it was called The Mao Mao War of the African people fighting for Independence the passage from one Empire to the other was miserably violent and bloody the the official count of deaths in World Wars one and two approaches a hundred million people it was the greatest Slaughter we have ever seen you would think with that history that the G20 could have been a historic meeting where the world tries to manage the decline of the American Empire and the rise of either the Chinese or a multinational new arrangement with Brazil Russia India China and South Africa perhaps working together but it would have been a historic meeting how can we accomplish this without more war look the United States tried to hold on to its Empire in the Korean War in the Vietnam War in the Afghanistan war in the Iraq War those at least were not nuclear now with the Ukraine war we are getting even closer to nuclear war that's what we need a meeting to face the reality of the world economy by those 20 countries and it should have been how do we make sure that this time we do not destroy a hundred million people that we do not destroy the planet and it is a tragedy of human history that nothing like that was proposed nothing like that was started nothing like that was accomplished so in my opinion a terrible missed opportunity and we know that in 2022 in Indonesia in in G20 Summit they put the Russian aggression against Ukraine right now they tried to do the same again but they couldn't do that in your opinion why they couldn't do that look the wind is changing in 2020 right you still had the image in the world in the Press of a dominant United States able to make war anywhere in the world remember the United States has 700 military bases around the world the American Navy is everywhere the American Air Force is everywhere uh in 2020 the the total GDP the total output of the G7 was about the same as the total output of the the five nations in the bricks by 19 by 2023 three years later the total GDP of the G7 has fallen to about 29 of world output and the bricks before the addition of the new the six new countries the brics had already risen to about 32 33 percent so already you could see and then you could see also in the Ukraine war a very very powerful message let me remind you and I am not taking sides I do not favor Putin over zielinski Russia for me this is a horrible War I'm against it I'm not I don't want one side to win the other one to this is awful it's got nothing to do with what I think the world needs and wants so please don't misunderstand what I'm saying I'm trying to see what's going on for what it is When The War begins February 24 in the year 2022 okay at that time the United States announced that this war would destroy Russia that Russian Ruble would collapse that the Russian economy would to quote the defense minister of the United States be driven to its knees other commentators in the west particularly the British and the Americans even began talking about a defeated Putin being driven out of power and Russia being divided up into many smaller countries okay by the time of this G20 meeting the world saw that the threats the promises the Declarations of the United States were all wrong the ruble didn't collapse Russia didn't collapse so far if if I had to say looking at the map who's winning and who's losing I think it's Crystal Clear in the world that the Russians have moved many miles to the West beyond what were their borders and that the Ukrainian military with enormous support from the G7 has been unable to stop it or reverse it all right the world is simply reacting they don't want to make a declaration against the winner this is not the way to do what to to show friendliness to what is now the largest economic power in the world namely China and the brics so they're not going to do it in the United States made the terrible mistake of not understanding that this is very classical behavior of declining Empires toward the end of every Empire the Greek the Roman the Persian the ottoman the you the Dutch the French at the end they don't want to face the decline so they do what historians call overreach they they misunderstand the limits of their own power and the result is they make their own situation worse because they use their power and now the whole world sees that they don't have the power that people thought they had you see it in Afghanistan when the Taliban is now in charge the Taliban was the enemy the United States went to war in Afghanistan and lost and you know and and the same is more or less true in Vietnam with the government there it's more or less true in Iraq and so on so this is behavior that is a mistake a terrible mistake but it is very common to declining Empires how did you see the this joining of Africa as a new member of G20 is going to be g21 I assume yeah well you know that this is a slow historic process the bricks have already been in existence for years everything moves slowly uh partly that's because the new emerging Empire is afraid of what the old declining Empire might do notice how um the former head of Brazil rushed to explain to the world that the bricks is not intended to be anti-American or anything like that she has to say it because it isn't true she has to say it because they don't want to provoke in the United States the reaction that they're going to provoke anyway but she's trying I think what you're seeing is a slow motion transformation and that it's going to include the entire Global South whether it's Africa Asia Latin America it's all the same in this way because they now have all those countries now have a new Option a new possibility they don't have to look for economic development for loans for investment just to the United States and Western Europe and Japan or Canada you know they don't have to look to the G7 they have an option the bricks the bricks already together produce a larger GDP gross domestic output than the G7 do so you have now and so all of those countries are looking to see who can be more helpful to them and if they are forced to choose which they hope they don't have to they would like much better to play one against the other see what the bricks offer see what the G7 offers take the better offer each time that would be for them the best but they're certainly going to deal with the bricks to see how what kind of offer they could get to build a railroad to deliver oil to buy outputs to build mines and you know all of that um and that's going to appear to Americans and to the world each time that happens as another sign of the decline of the dominant position of the West which it is and there's nothing they can do they are discovering to their enormous upset that there's nothing much they can do about it of course here and there they will be able to do something if the Conservative candidate wins in the elections in Argentina then Argentina he says will withdraw from the bricks so they come in one month and they go out you know so that's possible and my expectation is that will happen to other countries too so there'll be some yes growing and that's part of the struggle now had the G20 done what they could have done they might have developed some rules governing this some procedures so that it wouldn't be chaotic so you wouldn't have the secret police of Russia and China busy you know on one side of the capital city while the American CIA and the British MI6 are busy on the other side of the same Capital City trying to maneuver a coup d'etat or a military or you know the story it's it's been going on for the last century anyway it's not new but you might have put some rules some limits so we don't have War they couldn't do that they can't they they continue to make believe that these things are not going on even though every leader knows it most of the journalists in the world know it and the people of the world already make jokes about it but it's like you know it's like sex everybody knows what that's about but has to pretend as though they can't discuss it in public because of leftover religious uh taboos okay foreign
