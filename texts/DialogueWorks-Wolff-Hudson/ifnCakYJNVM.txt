when it comes to the capitalism they're talking about that capitalism is by far the most effective and productive economic system Ohio Senator James W just recently said that Russia produces as much ammunition in a day as the US does in a month what's the problem with the US economy that they're not capable of producing enough ammunition to help Ukraine well let me begin with a comment uh I do not believe it is an exaggeration to say that the spokespersons for every economic system in the history of the world have included people who say that whatever system they are the spokesperson of is the best and the most efficient and the most Equitable and the most and the most fill-in the blank with positive adjectives this is child dish and you you would imagine that reasonably mature people would get Beyond this kind of cheerleading uh if they're involved in a serious uh conversation it is actually very easy to show whether you are looking at ancient tribal economy or Village economies or slave economies or feudal economies that they had their areas where they were were remarkably efficient side by side with areas where they were remarkably inefficient assuming that there's a standard that enables you to distinguish between them which frankly I don't believe there ever was or is let me explain briefly when you notice that there's profitability in a particular industry and the CEO or the CEOs in that industry are asked why are you profitable and they give that wonderful answer that they should have outgrown in fourth grade uh we're a very efficient company here the only appropriate response is laughter why well what does efficiency mean conventionally in economics efficiency purports to do the following thing it looks at the consequences of some ACT let's take a for example uh is it efficient to expand the hospital to add a new Wing to that hospital or for a company is it efficient to buy a fleet of trucks or to hire 50,000 more people or whatever whatever the issue is here's what you're taught you look at all the benefits that flow from this act and you look at all the costs of this act and you compare them if the benefits are larger than the costs why then it's efficient and you go ahead and do it and if the costs are better than or larger than the the total of benefits well then it's inefficient and you don't do it okay all right now here are two simple problems and here I'm simply talking basic philosophy or if you like basic mathematics how do you know all of the costs or all of the benefits of anything that has ever happened or that could ever happen and the answer is you cannot do that and no one ever has part of the reason is that cost and benefits lie in the future and it's kind of hard to get a good number on what they will be and if there is an economist who knows what the cost will be well then that Economist is going to become very rich because they have figured out how to tell the future which of course is a scam they can't do that number two the costs and benefits are infinite in number and variety to go back to my example suppose there's a hospital considering building a new Wing well if they build that new wing it will change traffic patterns in that area change traffic patterns will alter real estate prices change traffic patterns will it change the number of people that get injured or die in automobile accident how in the world can you know in advance what all the costs from doing this are and the answer is you cannot so here's what all cost benefit analyses have in common they are frauds because they cannot do what they claim to do what they actually do is look at a selection of the costs that you can do and a selection of the benefits that you can do but then the only interesting thing is the principle of selection because it isn't a comprehensive comparison long story short if you do any serious investigation then you cannot evaluate the efficiency of any economic system and the people who claim that it is the most efficient are giving you to use a technical term total and they ought to be called on the carpet for doing that there is it it really is kind of childish CBS did the report 60 Minutes back in May of last year and in that report they showed that the defense department of the United States is a place that doesn't have enough ammunition because the companies producing defense equipment you know planes ships missiles guns are engaged in and you can see the statements there from all the relevant officials price gouging and the price gouging is not modest the price gouging is outrageous and they give you the figures there a price that's a 100 times what it ought to be or more here's the irony it's not that Russia can produce what we can't produce my guess is the United States can outproduce Russia let's remember the GDP with all the problems which we have discussed about what the GDP means but the GDP of the United States is 2122 trillion doar and the GDP of Russia is one and a half trillion dollars we are talking vastly different Industrial Systems and the reason why the United States doesn't have enough ammunition and by the way that is part of the reality of why Russia is doing as well in the war in Ukraine as it is it's not because they produce more or better it's because they don't have and this is going to affect a lot of Americans if they take this seriously they don't have the level of corruption that we do we have outdone them and you know what this is like this is the same story that has Afflicted every Empire in human history this is the story of why the Romans could not defeat The Barbarians in the fifth century a it's why medieval kingdoms fell apart it's not because they couldn't produce enough knives and guns and Spears and all the rest of it but that the internal mechanisms of the system made it no longer functional and like efficiency calculus is part of the mental corruption if you like these makeb believe categories we look back on the Middle Ages and we smiled to one another when decisions were made by kings and queens who consulted their advisors who read the appropriate passage in the Bible to find the answer we think we're better than that the Bible we say there was a book there were lots of books I picked that one yeah yeah well the notion that you can do the right thing by following Jesus is exactly On a par with the notion that you can do the right thing by choosing the efficient alternative as if you were in a position to do that I used to tell my students all the training in the world will not enable you to leap over their empire state building you just can't jump over it so you don't bother training to do what you know you can't do why do we train people in cost benefit analysis it is a mirage it is an ideological exercise in order to sanction whatever decisions are made for altogether different reasons by pretending they have been authorized by an objective outside absolutely true arbitrator well in medieval times that was called God today we call it efficiency analysis it is the same fantasy well I think that uh you don't have to look at the future in order to make projections I think efficiency is in the eye of the beholder uh Boeing for instance is much in the news and Boeing found it uh uh very efficient uh instead of making airplanes uh uh that were adjusted to new fuel efficient engines it found it more efficient to make airplanes and crashed uh to the uh Executives that was efficient because they could use their money instead of changing uh the engineering around instead of building a new airplane they could use the revenue that they were getting simply to uh for stock BuyBacks and to pay out of dividends uh so that was very efficient uh and uh in terms of prices of course you can forecast prices if uh you're in a monopoly position and you can charge whatever you want you decide uh what price you're going to charge uh it's uh at your will and U you can you have control over costs especially it's the government that's what the Pentagon capitalism is that I think was uh really was what the interview was talking about under C Pentagon capitalism uh I think uh a decade ago was making a toilet seat for $20 and charging $3,500 for it but uh now they're even more uh aggreg just uh overruns so it's very efficient if you're Boeing uh or a another military contractor is not efficient from the whole economy so I think the really the real question uh since uh uh our talk is about capitalism versus socialism is uh what's efficiency uh under capitalism and uh what's productive and productivity well the textbook uh presentation of industrial capitalism says it's very efficient uh uh and it was efficient in the 19 century it was more efficient than feudalism and that was really what industrial capitalism uh set out to be to cut Co not to raise the costs of Pentagon capitalism and what you're talking about but to cut costs and it uh it cut the economy's overall costs by getting rid of the landlord class uh so instead of uh paying uh land rent to uh hereditary aristocracy you would use that as a tax base uh you would uh essentially uh get rid of Monopoly rent and you'd get rid of financial r rent in other words what made capitalism efficient was that it was moving toward socialism and it was moving toward socialism by having the government take the lead in providing uh basic needs uh for the what it for the cost of living and for uh the cost of doing business so that the employers didn't have to pay them uh the uh these costs were to be paid essentially by progressive taxation of the wealthiest property owners and the wealthiest uh uh Financial uh operators uh and as I think as we discussed uh last time the income tax in America in 1913 fell only on the uh wealthiest 1% so uh in the 19th century industrial capitalism uh certainly looked productive to the extent that uh it was uh supporting a mixed economy a private public economy that was moving towards uh the government uh uh producing all of the communications Education Health Services transportation that could otherwise be monopolized or that labor would have to pay for and hence the employers would have to pay for so the question is uh you know what went wrong well what went wrong was that the the rent recipient class fall back and uh the uh they fought back for the last century uh ever since World War to and especially since the 1980s we don't have industrial capitalism anymore uh sometimes it's called Monopoly capitalism but I prefer to call it Finance capitalism because uh banks are the mother of monopolies and it's the financial sector that has promoted monopolies because they can efficiently make money much much uh easier simply by uh charging uh uh whatever they want and uh not having to take the customers into account not by producing uh good materials efficiency today is a race to the bottom it's a race to the bottom in employment it's a race to the bottom in quality it's a race to the bottom uh for Boeing making airplanes that sudden that uh uh don't really have uh much uh oversight and Regulatory control and they uh uh they're doors blow open and they crash so again uh we're living in a world where the whole concept of efficiency uh changes and productivity uh is no longer simply the physical productivity of uh output per manh hour uh it's h how do you create wealth and you create wealth and being productive uh in the way that Goldman Sachs had said uh that Goldman Sachs Partners were the most productive workers in the United States because they make the most money and they make the most money financially they make the most money by taking over companies uh SM uh breaking them up smashing them down and uh essentially uh de-industrializing them so uh today the most efficient capitalism is post-industrial capitalism or Finance capitalism uh you say it's corrupt and they say no we've just uh We've uh made politics a free market and if uh Boeing and uh other the military spending people have the ability to back the campaigns of the congressman on the uh uh milit on the uh military committees and the uh the Monopoly committees and uh if they don't back uh What uh we're doing if they criticize us we'll just use the free market to back their uh political opponents in the next uh primary uh election so again what is efficiency uh it's no longer what it used to be there's a point that um Michael made that is recognized at least in the textbooks in economics it's one of those topics that you blow through in 10 minutes of some lecture and never uh return to it because it is embarrassing if you return to it since it invalidates most of the rest of the semester's work it's a distinction between private profitability and social profitability or private costs and social costs and and the argument is is really very simple uh let's take a situation where a capitalist decides uh it is quote unquote more efficient I am going to buy this new machine and that will allow me uh to fire 50 workers because the new machine can do what those 50 workers used to do so our capitalist compares the machine only costs a 100 and the money he saves by firing 50 workers is 200 so he's ahead if he buys the machine and fires the workers so he does there's a net gain to him of 100 the difference between the money he had to lay out for the machine and the money he saved from firing the worker very simple very logical now the question are we done have we now seen an efficient act has our capitalist pursuing the profitable outcome made the right decision well to do that we'd have to look at the costs and the benefits and let me tell you about the costs they are not just the buying of the Machine by Mr capitalist the costs are everything that happens to those 50 workers their spouses their children the neighborhood they live in the real estate values of the homes they occupy the viability of the stores they used to patronize I could go on we know from a thousand studies that those 50 unemployed people will have higher rates of alcohol olism spouse abuse mental physical injury and illness those are costs Society is going to have to bear those costs the doctors the social workers you know the difficulties the uh fired workers children are now going to have in school because there's turmoil at home because mother or father are out of work nobody counts it it it it because capitalism refuses to take any responsibility for those 50 workers we in the world of analysis thinkers professors whatever we are we are supposed to somehow blindly go along with complete that we are finished when we compare the cost of the machine that automates with the uh the loss of those jobs and the minute you don't do that the minute you admit that the social costs are not exhausted by those private costs that are counted by the capitalist remember he only counts what he has to pay for the only thing he has to do is pay for the new machine he doesn't have to pay for the mental health Counseling of the children of the fired workers not his responsibility so so for him that cost does not exist but for those of us that are interested in the community as a whole the costs do exist and a system that constantly pretends otherwise is going to be making one decision after another that is inefficient because if you look at all the costs they far exceed the benefits and here here what's worse the benefits flow to one part of the community and the costs are borne by another part of the community making it a political explosion of what's going on here automation is profitable to the employer class and it is an enormous burden and cost to the employee class and because of that it comes back and bites the employer in the rear end as well it is a social economic disaster and if you were honest in economics you'd know that and you wouldn't teach the rest of the course on the premise that profit as an incentive is some successful mechanism it isn't it's idiotic well when you talk about social costs you're really talking about the long run costs in the sense of what are the results of this automation you're talking about uh but Finance uh lives in the short run and if you have uh corporations controlled by the financial sector they live in the short run and they don't care about financial costs and even more they try to make the government pay the cleanup costs uh you can take for instance uh oil FR uh fracking uh it pays uh for the oil crackers to uh pump chemicals into the ground to force uh the gas uh or oil up to the surface and the result is to pollute the water supply so you can light a match to the water that comes out of your tap and uh it catches on fire uh for the uh oil companies and for the uh Financial for the banks and the financial investors uh this is very uh this is uh High productivity uh you could take uh and if you have uh the uh financial sector writing the laws that shape the marketplace you have something like the transpacific partnership that said suppose you have an oil company that uh pollutes the land for instance of Ecuador or in Kazakhstan uh if a government passes a law saying uh now the oil company has to pay the cleanup cost of cleaning up the pollution that it's caused uh in the uh waterways or in the land uh they have to uh reimburse the company for the entire fine because uh that's an external economy well what you're talking about Richard is the the external economy is society uh so that if a government imposes a cost to benefit Society at the cost of uh the American foreign investor or any other foreign investor that's against the law legally and no government can end up uh receiving any money for the cleanic of cost that it doesn't have to immediately pay right back into the company uh so in effect the role of government is to protect the polls uh and uh to protect uh what you call profits and I call economic rent because increasingly uh the profits of uh oil companies and mining companies and monopolies uh are unearned income they're not uh they're not producing value they're producing uh a right to charge whatever you want to charge uh so that you don't have to project the value of uh something in terms of the costs the labor costs and the raw material cost again uh you're you're getting a free lunch uh without working without producing value uh just by collecting rent and uh of course the na the GDP accounts the national income accounts calls all of this earnings uh but they're not really earned income they're not profits again they're economic rent and that's the kind of rent-seeking economy that we've uh uh come into it's a tunnel visioned economy you call it corrupt the uh economics are uh corrupt uh they're really tunnel visioned they don't want to take in the social costs because that would reduce the returns to uh the financial uh owners of uh the companies that are imposing these costs on Society at large if I could add I agree completely but I I I want to take it kind of another um another step if I could there is a bizarre phenomena going on here that we should understand when Michael says that the government is called in to clean up the government is called in to protect the government is called in to serve whether it's the cap the employer class as a whole or a subdivision of it that gets into a dominant position like Finance capital in recent decades here's the remarkable thing about that not only is government called in to bail out the failed capitalist system let's all remember in 2008 and 9 all of the major banks in the United States the big ones were bankrupt by the definition of liabilities relative to assets they were busted they could could not F they they didn't trust each other to give each other overnight loans the way they normally do every day because they weren't confident that Bank of America or City Bank or Wells Fargo would give back in the morning what was lent to them the night before because they might do a Layman brothers or a Bear Sterns or any of the others that folded okay okay here's the wonderful part about that at the same time that the government is the servant the faithful desperate servant of the employer class it develops an ideology which says that capitalism is a perfect system except when the government messes up we call these people cuz they like the label Libertarians but has nothing to do with Liberty it's an ironic Aldis Huxley kind of inversion of the word meaning this has nothing to do with Liberty this is a hustle this is a person selling you a major interest in the Brooklyn Bridge blame the government brilliant every flaw that capitalism has you can now admit and use it to beat up on the government with the effect that all the government is left with the responsibility of doing is bailing out capitalism's failures because otherwise it has been beaten to death with demonization as if it were the problem most of the people who will become powerful in the United States if Donald Trump wins the election will be libertarian infused policy makers who are going to act on this lunacy with by the way the predictable results which are not pretty I'm glad you mentioned Li the concept of Liberty and Libertarians uh you're absolutely right libertarianism uh supports a centrally planned economy much more centrally planned than a mixed economy more centrally planned than an economy like China but uh the central planning is done not by elected government officials but by Wall Street in the financial sectors so uh when people say they're a Libertarian they say they want Liberty from government regulation so they don't have to follow uh rules to protect Society they want Liberty from being taxed uh so that it's labor and uh the productive sectors that are taxed not uh the uh corporate sector and the financial sector that owns the uh the sector so the question is Liberty from whom uh and uh this is what again the language has been inverted from what it was during the Heyday of industrial capitalism from Adam Smith and John Stewart Mill and Marx uh into uh just the opposite uh so uh every uh the way to to uh respond to these guys is again the meaning of words and uh that's what made George Orwell's discussion of double think and speak so great enormously important this topic because these these are not just U pathological behaviors these are not just the objects of what Michael and I can say critically these are symtoms of a system that is done that is over its peak that is in Decline holding on to these nonsensical ideas becomes rational because the system is spinning out of control here you have a a again I'm going to use Ukraine even if it provokes some people on one side the United States the G7 Britain France Germany Italy Canada Japan and the United States a comined GDP and again I without lording that statistic it's just a very rough measure but a combined GDP by my count about $32 trillion in a war in Ukraine with a country Russia with a GDP of$ and A5 trillion dollar this is a joke what kind of war is this this is David and Goliath only they're David and we're Goliath it's ridiculous and the fact that it isn't that the Russians have actually won the war at least so far tells you that something is terribly a miss Mr zalinski is explaining that they don't have enough ammunition they've used up the shells the tanks the missiles not just from the United States but from Britain France Germany and so on what in the world is going on how does a one and a half trillion dollar economy find itself inadequately producing what $ 32 trillion doll worth of economy is like something is crazy here and I think that is where people ought to take this kind of thinking if University is teaching people that there's an efficiency you learn how to count costs and benefits this is the this is the exact modern equivalence of having taught medieval Scholars how to count the number of angels that dance on the head of a pin angels have no Dimensions the head of the pin is very small but how many angels can very small accommodate an Infinity if they have no Dimensions those are and there were debates about this and we think it's funny but I can assure you in the future there'll be people who look back on this nonsense about efficiency and the nonsense about libertarianism shaking their heads in disbelief that reasonably educated adults got caught up in this sort of stuff
