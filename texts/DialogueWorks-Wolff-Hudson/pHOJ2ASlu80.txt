hi everybody today is Thursday March 6 2025 and our friends Richard Wolff and Michael Hudson are back with us welcome back glad to be here good good to be here let's get started Michael with the article in the financial times in which it says that three European countries France England and Germany had announced that they will make any agreement reached between Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin inoperative what does that mean Michael well it means two things uh for one thing uh they want to rearm uh arm uh the Euro Zone basically uh you had a few days ago starmer in England coming out and saying we' we've got to grab uh as much of the $300 billion doll that uh the EU has seized from Russia and spend it on arms and starmer said this can be a Revival of English uh uh British uh industry uh he says we can we're going to send a big chunk of it to Belfast to the uh British military industrial complex to begin making arms uh macron now has said well we're going to send it to uh France uh the Germans say we're going to send it to Merz uh has said going to spend it in in uh Germany and uh the uh Germans and Europeans have made military spending exempt from the Euro Zone restriction that uh running a budget deficit be limited to just uh 5% or less of GDP they say all limits are off uh we're going to have a militarized economy uh and the article you site is a very bellicose article uh by uh Ganesh saying Europe must trim welfare to fund Warfare well the Europeans uh uh today uh just after he wrote the article which already was posted yesterday said no no we don't have to cut welfare we can do it both we can use military is our new welfare it's going to be uh employing uh Europeans it will lead to uh a a Revival and the result is that today the stock the bond market in Germany crashed uh by about uh 5% when the bond prices go down that means interest rates are going way up because the bond holders say this is going to be very inflationary If U uh Germany announced it's going to increase its military spending from uh under 2% to three and a half percent the economy itself is going to be shrinking 1% a year this means that the non-military uh part of the economy is going to shrink very rapidly by about 5% it means Unemployment uh it means uh uh cutbacks and the financial times put a happy face on all of this in its editorial page their editorial all over the uh the place on this saying no the reason that interest rates are going up is European uh Executives and industrialists are so happy that uh they're we now going to have a military Revival that uh they're all borrowing money to invest in uh the new Prosperity that we're going to make by uh providing the arms uh to give to Ukraine and they say the virtue of this is that it makes any agreement that Trump may make with President Putin of Russia inoperable because the whole idea of the uh that that what Trump was trying to do his fantasy was that somehow uh Putin and lavro and the Russians will say all right we'll do we'll make the same mistake now that we made last time uh when uh we had a an agreement uh that there will be disarmament and will stop the hostilities while you move in all of your U military uh forces to uh make sure that you can attack us and just pretend uh to actually uh have peace while you're actually planning to attack us uh and the Europeans say that's just exactly what we're going to do and we're announcing that we're going to do it so that there will be no chance that Russia can ever say yes we agree to uh h of hostilities well that means that Trump will not get the public relations pushed that he'd uh been promising uh and it's as if uh you You' if you look at the last 200 years you've had the three bellicose European countries attack Russia you had Napoleon in 1812 he lost uh in the Battle of borodino uh you had uh England in the creman war it lost uh in 1853 the the 500s rode into the guns and uh iously uh died for their country and then you had Hitler in uh Germany 1945 you know that failed but the Europeans uh together uh with uh the European uh Union uh leader Von Delan and uh the crazy Estonian lady said if we all you know it's true that all three of us lost to Russia but if we all do it together we can win and we can win without the United States uh and so the question is how are they going to get the money out to do it uh and uh they there's some of the countries are blocking the uh loosening of the uh limitation on how large a budget deficit can be Hungary and other countries are doing it and so there's renewed pressure from the United States to grab the $300 billion dollar that uh the European Union has sequestered uh from Russia now one of the discussions between um Russia and Putin that have been openly uh discussed is that the uh any a agreement that you know we're going to talk about settlement you have to drop the sanctions against Russia and you have to give us back the act of war that Europe and the United States have done by confiscating the 300 billion in foreign reserves we have uh and the French especially are arguing with uh uh the English the French are saying well it's a we really it this uh breaks all of the international laws and nobody's going to uh agree to keep their foreign reserves in Euros anymore if they see that we can do it well today as I said the financial times not only ganesha's article but the uh American uh advisor uh Philip Gordon to the bid Administration the National Security advisor said you know that's not uh that's not the case at all uh of course we can uh we we have the right to do it and we can tie it up in international law we can say that international law this is a uh response to uh to Russia's unprovoked invasion of uh Ukraine so we're back with this whole false narrative that's underlying uh the uh the European policy and uh the European press the guardian in England and I'm sure the French and the German press are also uh uh behind all of this uh uh Revival so giving this money to Ukraine means giving it to the European and uh American military industrial complex to uh essentially rearm well what's goofy here is that how long how long is it going to take to produce These Arms to give to Ukraine we're talking about a three to four year uh period of uh actually turning this money into actual arms well obviously it can't be done and U well president Trump is pressing for a very fast resolution he wants to uh arrange to go to Russia to meet with Putin as quick as possible so that he can say we have a win and maybe people will uh look at that instead of looking at Israel uh and Gaza uh we have a win but uh he he's really not going to be uh he will hear from Russia saying well I know you want it quickly don't worry it's we are going to make an agreement very quickly uh the there's almost Universal agreement in the UN European and American press that the fighting in Ukraine cannot go more than two to four months longer with without uh the Ukrainian Army being totally defeated and Russia going right up to the deeper uh River in Ukraine and along the Sea Coast uh to Odessa well uh you can see how uh Trump is already said well we've just made what we call a rare earth agreement with Ukraine well it's not about Rare Earth at all it's about the ports and there's one port in particular Odessa which would be turned over to United States uh and it's about uh the gas pipelines in the infrastructure uh the reason that Trump and the American Press call it rare earth is because that's not what's really important what's really important is the very things that are going to be a deal breaker with Russia uh if uh president Trump meets with uh President Putin and says well uh we've just made a deal uh you know we're going to have peace but we've made a deal with uh as zinski that he's giving uh the ports to us so uh we really can't let you take uh Odessa and Putin will say well you we've just had to send a big isander missile two missiles uh to blow up the arms delivery uh to Ukraine that somehow got into the Black Sea uh carrying all sorts of arms that were loaded up in Turkey uh from uh the NATO countries uh India Ukraine we're not going to let Ukraine uh and the neo-nazis there have control of the port that they can use to destabilize and bomb our ships throughout the Black Sea as we've been doing so that's a deal breaker so I think it it's as if the uh European uh belligerent countries uh England France and Germany have gotten together and say what can we do what are the pressure points to completely in re prevent any kind of an agreement between Trump and uh Putin from uh coming forth and I think that Trump is going to try to then uh blame either he'll blame Europe or Putin he always finds somebody to blame but the fact is that his whole fantasy is inoperable and uh I think there's uh one argument that I think Russia can put and I'm sure it's going to put it uh explicitly uh and say well there is a way that hostilities can stop and stop very soon you know Mr trump it take two months maybe three or four and that uh that is to uh to ask everybody look at where all of this fighting is leading every military analyst especially the ones that Nima has on his show have said that uh the uh the Ukrainian Army is collapsing their the recruits are running away the Army is retreating they don't have uh control of the air air power anymore uh to to stop things they they've run out of Munitions and they've run out of uh missiles uh to shoot uh they're exhausted and we're in the very final stage now of the fighting so yes uh there can be a ceasefire on the following terms let's say sit down and say let's look at where all this is leading let's look forward uh four months let's look at what things are going to look like in August and September and by August and September there won't be a Ukrainian Army anymore we'll be uh in control of the ukraini uh of Ukraine and we'll be cleaning up the Nazis there so uh we'll have let's have the ceasefire based on the assumption that indeed we're going to have all the land up to the Neer and all of the land along the southern uh coast of Ukraine uh the northern boundary of the Black Sea and uh accept that reality as a fat comple uh and in that in that sense you know we're willing to if you will accept where the Dynamics of the situation are leading then we can have a ceasefire uh because you'll Retreat you'll withdraw all of your forces uh you'll uh disarm well uh zalinski is being told well you don't have to disarm and even if you disarm we're going to be there supplying you with uh troops uh macron wants to send troops uh starmer wants to send troops and weapons that they really don't have so the the discussion dissolves into fantasy uh at that point but uh I think uh Trump's uh dream he he's going to get uh very uh Angry uh he was he did not discuss a word of any of this at his boring State of the Union speech um not I thought he uh there was talk that he was going to uh announce the withdrawal from NATO uh nothing like that uh he basically prepared the ground for saying that by saying I'm the greatest president since George Washington well maybe George was second best uh to me uh and I'm going to protect America and make it strong again to sort of prepare his Republican constituency for believing that somehow okay he's going to prepare us he's not going to be losing the War uh with Russia uh but somehow he's hoping that he can receive the Nobel Peace Prize for arranging the peace with Russia uh I mean the irony is uh he may receive it in jail for as a war criminal for supporting uh what he's doing in Gaza and Israel but uh that's the irony of History Richard just before going on what you want to talk about let me add something to what Michael said the German government and spokesman said that Germany doesn't plan to reestablish natural gas supplies from Russia or restore the northstream 2 gas pipeline unbelievable go ahead R yeah well I think the way to understand this let me come at it from a slightly different angle I think that the leaders of France Germany and England are in very very deep difficulty at home as political leaders all of them the newly elected Merz in Germany but likewise the long ago elected by a fluke let's remember Mr mro and by another kind of fluke uh the wholesale withdrawal of British voters from the conservative party which allowed Mr starmer uh to get in there they are all in deep trouble according to public polling Mr Merz is taking over a government that is basically the continuation of the Schultz government with Mr Schultz's party his partner as he was Schultz's partner before uh this is the same old same old these are politicians whose entire polit itical career has been as Junior Partners I'm being polite here a synonym would be lacky of the United States right and they have discovered that the United States their backer their liazon their supporter is abandoning them and therefore they are it do for a political collapse they have no support anymore they're only people don't want them and the United States is less and less interested I mean the Absurd visits of macron and starmer to Washington last week when they were spoken to as if they were visiting cousins who you couldn't reschedule for a later time uh everything they hoped for not given to them culminating in the zalinski theater at the end of the week I mean these were demonstrations of absurdity and what you're getting here is the behavior of desperate politicians that's really all this is snatching those 300 billion from the Russians every major financial advisor has told them the obvious you will pay a longterm price because no shaky government in the world will leave its money in Europe ever again because of what the Europeans are prepared to do with it this is a bigger blow to the importance of Europe than anything having to do with Ukraine why would you do uh you know keep going a losing War you have to be desperate to do that and Reaching Across the political divide in this country to do something to get together with the Democrats notice that the financial times carries an article by uh Camala Harris advisor in The Same Spirit as what the these three Europeans that's going to solidify that the United States government now and government for the next four years will look upon the Europeans as Traders people dealing with the Democratic Party coming across with Notions about protecting Ukraine was bad enough before but now it's out in the open and Mr Trump has no reason not to make a big deal of this bizarre uh Evolution so in these are not different from they're they're additional to the points that Michael uh that Michael is making now let me take it a step further NATO all always was an arrangement peculiar to its moment in history at the end of World War II you formed NATO for two reasons number one Western capitalism was more threatened by a socialist and communist movements From Below than it had ever been the leaders of the resistance to the nais in Europe were Communists and socialists from Norway in the north to Italy in the South so the first thing NATO had to do was deal with that problem if you go back and you read uh Churchill speech in Missouri he put that first NATO's first R was to hold back communism and the second one was to make an enemy out of the Soviet Union be because it was necessary for the Europeans to see the communism that had come up in their own countries as if it were a foreign policy of the Soviet Union very useful on that basis you could go at a joint attack on both of them attack anti-communism at home and we know that that's what they all did in to their varying degrees of success and an enormous block against Russia and the whole thing would allow the United States the only country that came out of World War Two economically to pay for it with the game we're GNA pay for it because we're the only ones who can sell what it is we're going to buy so we'll protect Europe is a fancy way of saying we're going to give money to our defense apparatus the likes of which no one had ever seen which was a tall order because normally after a World War you would demobilize your military we didn't we jacked it up so that it worked beautifully we got the right-wing governments in Europe we you know look at what happened in Greece where we literally cut cut a deal with Stalin about the Greece and the rest of the Balkan on and very obvious what was going on in hindsight all of that is over over Russia is no longer the Soviet Union and the left has been defeated it's still there but it is disoriented and it is poorly organized that will change that is already changing but it is for the moment true so what do you need a NATO for answer nothing NATO is nothing those three countries when I when when you quoted earlier I believe Michael did that one of the leaders said we are more you know we are unified now no you're not you're not unified at all if you pursue this policy you will fracture and I'm not even talking about all the things the United States can and will do if you declare war on the United States they will declare war back on you and I don't mean military war I mean now okay here's the single largest problem of Europe just just so people get it Europe is a disunified place it's got lots and lots of countries big and small every one of them worries about the Loyalty of the other ones when Mr Trump comes and offers good deals to one of them and then another of them he won't get any of them don't be silly of course he will and the the suspicion in Paris about what the Germans might be negotiating and in both of those places what the British might be doing and the Italians and oh my good that's what makes Europe poor as a player and the last thing blows my mind we are unified yeah but the Russia you're thinking of opposing is now part of the bricks has the Ally of China are you kidding you really want to develop your military with the Americans hostile towards you on one side and the Russia China bricks you're crazy this is the behavior and the mentality of people who are desperate and if they take their steps which I think they will because it will certainly please the people they've always pleased the industrialists the financiers the people who run Europe but they are going to pay a price they cut the welfare that has been the uniform gift to the European masses for the last 75 years you start really taking that away I don't mean nibbling they've been nibbling but I mean really taking it away you're going to see a a swing to the far right and the far-left that make what you've already seen look like nothing in compar Aris only desperate politicians especially in the history of Europe would do this they really are seeing and you can see look in the eyes of vanderen or any of the others you look closely you see desperation and anxiety these are people heaving Hail Mary passes down the field and they don't care anymore because they know it's over I think it's more like Resolute hatred uh I I think you're right when you commented at the beginning that uh the European leaders seem to be weak relative to their what the population wants we know that the population wants exactly what you're talking about they want social welfare they don't want a war in Ukraine uh to interfere with uh their cost of living through the higher electricity and gas prices uh through cutting back of the uh social welfare programs especially housing which is going way up uh and yet the leaders are ins sconed in their position you just had the election in Germany where uh you had Merz uh the candidate from Black Rock where he used to work uh looking forward to Black Rock taking over uh much of Ukraine on the deal that is being arranged by Trump just like uh Black Rock has uh just taken over the Chinese Holdings of the Panama Canal in the last few days uh China realized that uh the US was about to attack it or do something very unpleasant to it with the Panama Canal so it sold the port development that was initially thought of as being part of its built- and Road initiative to uh the canal uh they sold it out to Black grot so in a way sorry I'm I have to I'm talking too loud uh and I get excited uh the the Europeans uh are trying to figure out well what's their cover story going to be and certainly you get uh from starmer's uh speeches in the last few days well we wanted to continue to fight and bleed Russia but Trump and the US let us down it's not our fault we did our best as but but that excuse that they're using assumes or pretends that the uh voters actually wanted uh Europe to defeat Ukraine instead of uh avoiding it Richard pointed out to the uh the fact that uh even if uh the sanction are lifted uh against trade and with Russia uh it doesn't matter that uh Germany has already said Well we'd already stopped importing uh gas and oil uh before the sanctions were on we don't need sanctions to prevent us from buying gas uh essentially Merz came out and said the last 100 Year years of international trade Theory are obsolete for a 100 years 200 years in England uh people have said talked about the gains from trade the idea is that countries trade with each other so that you can buy something less expensive abroad and everybody produces what they're best at producing at and uh so uh countries gain by obtaining some an international specialization of Labor uh to produce uh and consume many more Goods than they would have had if they each had to be independent and autonomous and self-reliant well all of that's out of the ordinary uh mer and the other German people say foreign trade is uh a dependency it's a hostage if you import from any country you are Hostage to Blackmail that they may not export to you and uh why would we want to buy Russian gas when uh it can hold us is a hostage and stop the gas to us and turn off our spigots if we don't do what what it wants and uh underlying this is what does Russia want the German say Russia wants to to March through bellarus uh to Poland uh and Germany right right to France and we're going to have to fight them in France if we don't fight them here well obviously uh Russia has zero interest in losing 10 m soldiers or however many it takes to March through I think Russia has realized that what uh you've just been discussing Richard has turned it into a dead zone economically and it will remain a dead zone until there is a uh left-wing uh Revival but as you pointed out quite correctly there doesn't seem to be that on the uh uh on the horizon I was very disappointed as we discussed last week when uh the Sarah vck party just missed uh getting the 5% limit it had over 4.9% of the vote but not quite 5% uh this was the single left-wing uh party in uh Germany that was very strong the Dinka party the old left party that Sarah lift uh is not that leftwing anymore it's more term neoliberal and uh the uh the the American policy ever since gladio in uh Italy uh has indeed ended up uh destroying most of the left we can only hope that President Putin's uh stopping of Aid uh meaning essentially the any the league for economic democracy uh uh is going to stop all of that uh uh that subsidy of uh right-wing journalism but for the time being uh there there isn't really a left and uh the I'm not sure how it will really develop but I think uh Russia is not going to have the faith that Europe is going to have a realistic policy that meets its material interests of raising living standards and reindustrialize in uh it seems to act as if it indeed has a uh a Death Wish economically so that is why Russia is turning to uh Eastward turning to China Asia central uh Central Asia the near East Africa and the the global South uh so the it it get it strains credulity for macron and uh uh the his colleagues to say well Russia somehow wants to invade us uh and and is a threat it's the LA all they can do is the old uh gibles argument you can always get a population behind you if you say we're threatened well the voters as you've pointed out Richard don't feel threatened but uh the uh the media are trying to whoop them up and uh uh they're that they actually believe what they're saying and I don't think vandaan is really frightened she's uh she and the Estonian kalis lady are so motivated by hatred uh these are people who with a Nazi background uh these These are people who uh really really hate any thought uh of of the leftwing uh the so you no longer have the situation that you had in 1945 um and I must say that's partly because Stalin's fault uh when uh at yelta when um the British uh uh prime minister uh passed a uh piece of paper across the table to Stalin saying here is how we're going to divide up the uh the country Stalin accepted what Churchill said and Stalin agreed to assign uh Greece to the British uh sphere of influence because Britain wanted to control the Mediterranean uh and uh is the route to to the near East and Stalin let the Communist Party of of Greece which is one of the strongest communist parties in the world be destroyed uh that was the horror of salom's betrayal of the international Revolution is what led Tito uh to um create a a really genuine worker state in Yugoslavia uh and led to the break of Yugoslavia away from the Soviet Union that that was the only hope there's no uh there's no thought today uh of a titoist uh uh type of workers control and uh workers structure and uh that's why in this fight against socialism that you've described the number one enemy uh for which they assigned Jeffrey Sachs to destroy was Yugoslavia they had to break it up because it was Yugoslavia that provided the most uh efficient and workable uh model of workers control and labor control and uh uh uh integration and uh that's why the IMF and uh saxs was spent in to smash it up I know that he's made amends by making very good speeches now but that's uh that's the history is unfolding pretty much just just as you described let let me add if I may Neema I think that the French the Germans and the British are lining up behind a war scare uh the articles in the financial times the very titles Warfare instead of welfare that's it that's the only card they have to play the support of the welfare state they don't do they never have done it it wouldn't look genuine if they tried it now so they're going to go down that road and let let me tell you why in one last way of doing this why this is crazy they are going to be lined up against two major alternative Powers the United States on one hand and China Russia combined on the other those two parts of the world are already many years ahead of Europe in the level of military technology in the level of military production they can Undertake and they are working night and day to get in their struggle with each other to get even further ahead you know who's far behind the Europeans and they're not going to catch up they don't have the money for it they don't have the political support for it this is a desperate way for a few Leaders with a short future to try to hold on for as long as they can that's it that's why I call it a Hail Mary P this is not a thought through this this is desperate they came back starmer and Macon came back and told the Germans that they got absolutely nothing in their visit to Mr Trump and Mr zalinski even less in the days since the zalinski visit the United States has announced a reduction in the intelligence that they provide to ukrainians they're leaving and if you think the Russians were able to win as much as they have when they were facing the combined us and Europe then what do you think is going to happen when it's Europe all by itself this is a joke this is this is a desperate effort that's why they have to resuscitate the danger that Russia will come and they have to give it a fiveyear it's going to happen in five year normal human beings are able to understand that absolutely nobody knows what's going to happen in five years and never did nobody understood where we would be now six months ago so this notion we have to take away welfare from you in order to to build up a military in a world where our two potential adversaries are light years ahead of us remember Europe has not developed its own military for 50 years it is a trivial military it's got to start this is a joke what you are doing and by the way to give the joke the ominous Edge it to have right now in Beijing in Moscow and in Washington the calculations are beginning okay we have the Europeans opting out now we have an agreed enemy the three of us Moscow Beijing and Washington can get together and agree to live together while they all consume Europe and the Europeans being weak economically weak politically weak militarily they're the obvious choice and to then be the loud mouse that roared gets you stepped on very very D you're seeing desperate leaders risking everything in what they are doing and and it it will come back and haunt them for a long long time on the other hand I don't think they'll be in power very much longer anyway well there's one very serious problem that I guess I should escalate uh uh the problem uh you were right that the whole fight by uh uh nato in uh after World War II was against socialism and uh uh the thought the threat of socialism but the fight is much uh more serious now it's a fight against government itself you have Trump and the uh the right-wing libertarian policies uh in Europe the uh alternative for deuts and the uh the uh the Italian corporate State opposing the whole idea of government and you had in the last few days you've had Trump's proposal uh by his the Commerce Secretary Howard uh ludik U on Sunday saying that we've got to get rid of government itself that's what uh musk is uh doing to essentially uh this uh disband uh all of the government and that's because libertarianism in free markets is a concept of centralized uh economy centralized IED planning but the centralized Planning by Libertarians and the haak and the free marketers is the centralized planning in the hands of Wall Street and the financial sector you take planning out of the hands of government uh and hence elected officials and put it in the hands of the people who you've seen around uh Trump in his speeches and ever since being elected uh president it's the billionaires who are in charge of planning and when musk goes to Germany and says we want you to vote for alternative for deuts he's not saying vote for Sarah vagen connect on the left uh uh for uh a pace instead of war in Ukraine vote for the party that wants to uh get rid of all social welfare spending well and indeed uh you had the so-called Social Democratic parties of uh of Germany was the big Los uh in the election um a few weeks ago so what you're fighting now is not only against uh socialism but against social democracy keynesianism the whole idea of a mixed economy with government having uh certain social functions and providing uh services to the population Health Care education so that employers do not have to pay labor high enough wages so that they have to pay these things out of the wages uh you're you're having an an attack on government itself and that's what leads uh the United States to throw its political support behind uh the uh the right-wing parties that were described and uh the Commerce Secretary in America says we want to uh have a new measure of the GDP without government the real economy is without government because the government uh uh doesn't produce Services uh the people want these Services can be done by privatization Margaret Thatcher was right we've got to make Europe and America uh the uh just uh what happened uh in uh England under Margaret Thatcher and Tony Blair and you you have the Social Democratic parties joining in this privatization anti-government views which indeed is why the social Dem rats lost in in Germany and why the labor party looks like uh uh starmer will be uh thrown out of office uh but with essentially only the right-wing antisocial Democrats really the corporate economy and uh melini said we shouldn't call it fascism we should call it the corporate corporate estate because it's a state run for a big business because that's what makes the profits and that's what the economy is is all about not social welfare so if that's the case then Europe is going to uh essentially fight to the last member of the working class uh I don't know how you make the parallel with fighting to the last Ukrainian uh but the situation uh of the Trump administration's uh be uh backing this anti-government uh feeling to dismantle government so even if there is a revive leftwing movement such as you and I would like to see Richard uh there there won't be the uh institutional apparatus surviving to become a vehicle to provide the welfare that's what's really making Europe going way down and losing that's the E the European death wish very well subsidized by the United States and it's uh the Death Wish of the Republican uh libertarian under Trump as well Richard just before going to yeah make your point C can I can I ask a question then you go and may add something to what Michael said and the question is why does Europe need Russia to be their enemy the enemy of Europe are they really afraid of themselves if there is no enemy out there they're going to fight with each other that's the the reason how do you see this well let me try to get at it uh a little bit indirectly and maybe a little bit disagree with Michael um I agree with him that this this libertarian ideology which it's very hard for me to take seriously the notion that the government is the bad guy without ever asking the question why exactly would the government be the bad guy since it's a government owned and operated by the very people uh who are giving you the argument that it is a bad guy if it's a bad guy it's because to what they make it do who the hell else deter I mean it's very strange to get angry at the servant rather than at the master who's telling the servant what to do it's the same mistake as you know blaming the messenger because you don't like the message very strange but put it aside I think you have desperation to to make Russia evil because it's the closest you can get to making government evil you remember you always have this problem for the libertarian he demonizes what he is he's the government but he he he has to act in this bizarre way I'm going to like Mr lotnik he has to be in the government which he declares is the total evil and so he's going to go out by self-destructing his government very odd kind of thing but we've seen it Thatcher Cameron the whole whole period of many years of the dominance of the the conservative party in England which ended up self-destroying because it doesn't work in modern capitalism the most successful capitalism of the last 25 years is the Chinese who have a very powerful government they've worked this out they have a private sector big and important they have a government sector they have a communist party and the government and they've made it work you may not like them you may that's a different matter but they've they've gotten the economic growth that dwarfs Europe and the United States by comparison not even close Chinese growth year after year is two to three times what it is in the west and there's no end of that Insight this year as well okay so what is the leadership ship going to do they're going to Hype their old ideology it's the government we get rid of the government everything will get better they've tried that they've tried that in England they've tried it elsewhere there's no sign that that works and there's nothing comparable to what the Chinese have accomplished who are at the other end of the private State Spectrum we don't have the Soviet Union which went further we have the hybrid of the Chinese but they're the dominant play so this is a game we're going to get rid of the government okay let's suppose they do that there is no reason for anyone to believe that this is going to somehow Vault them over what's going on in China and Russia where the government plays a much larger role nothing has happened in the in the west over the last half century that has dissuaded the Chinese or the Russians from a big powerful role from the government you know why are they stuck in an ideology well more or less so than we are they would have adjusted in fact the Chinese did part of the reason the Chinese have a big private sector is they wanted certain benefits to come from that which they have achieved while holding on to their hybrid so I for me what again I I I want to beat the dead horse very quick you have politicians whose situation is impossible they hitch their entire careers to the United States as the umbrella that they were the partners and they went to their people and said we are partnered with the great power we are therefore safe we may be a little Estonia or a little Slovenia but we're partnered with the United States which look in it brought the Soviet Union to its knees it's gone whoa wow and now their protector is telling them I'm not going to protect you anymore they're stuck they made it they made a PCT with a devil who has now betrayed them they have nowhere to go politically so they have to either hype the old libertarian song again or revive the anti-soviet and now in an anti-russia hysteria okay that'll work for a while their populations have been a custo but it's a shrinking game it doesn't solve their problem Europe each year Falls further and further behind no major technical breakthrough of the last 10 or 15 years comes from Europe they don't have their own telecommunications they don't have their own new military technology Putin sends a new missile they don't know what to do they can't possibly handle this they can't possibly replace the United States in the Ukraine that's a bad joke now I may be wrong in the following maybe this will work I'd like to know Michael's opinion maybe this deal in which the Democratic party here makes a common effort with those folks in Europe trying to manage to undo Mr Trump's trajectory maybe that'll work maybe Mr Trump will shift gears maybe he'll be frightened I don't know I think I can I think I can uh explain the dynamic that's at work uh you said why is the government B uh uh bad why is why is Russia bad and that's because uh it's doing uh the government is doing what privatizers would like to take over and turn into Monopoly profits the government uh uh is indeed controlled by the uh by the the billionaires who uh thanks to Citizens United and the fact that elections are a function of campaign donors but the government still uh is charged and structured to provide many social services and the social service that government provides are in government hands because they're natural monopolies and they the social Democrats beginning in the late 19th century uh kept them in uh government hands so that the you the economy wouldn't have uh Communications and transportation and other uh choke points uh that were basic needs turned into uh person monopolies well the government's the enemy and social democracy is the enemy because uh it's not Russia as such uh but that the uh neocons uh and neoliberals need a convenient enemy around which to mount the uh libertarian takeover you always need an enemy to do what you're trying to do and the libertarian billionaires want to do to Europe and the United States just what the neoliberals did to Russia in the 1990s they want to uh turn over all of the mass of government property national parks government uh real estate government agencies uh uh all of these they they want to turn over to the financial managers to turn into monopolies that can be financialized and create wealth in the form of uh stock market gains and bond market market gains that's what what the game is it's not uh so much geopolitical uh antagonism towards Russia that's uh the sort of superficial rapping it's about a political anti-government fascist ideology uh that that's what I think we're dealing with no I I see them going on together using each other shifting back and forth the whichever flies whichever gets you the best polling results do you demonize Russia do you demonize your own government mix them up add them together link them but again I say it for Europe the strategy of Europe catching up with either the United States or Russia China that's not going to solve your problem just not it's gonna it's going to cost you the very turmoil as Mark as Michael began today's conversation the very turmoil of the next three or four or five years as you move your resources away from everything you've been doing to to making a defense establishment is gonna occasion all kinds of difficulties they G to take them away from all of the things they need to be doing to try to catch up with the rest of the world the decline of Europe is a hundred years old I don't see this doing anything other than accelerating it even further then we're in full agreement the Euro zone is a dead zone yeah very very and and let's be clear it is shooting itself in the foot it is very busy shooting it it's it's notion maybe this is a good way to end you know for 500 years Europe could claim to be and it did make the claim that it's this center of the world it's where the Roman Empire it's where great medieval then it was the great Colonial takeover of the whole rest of the world organized in by and for Europe what we are watching is a late stage in the dismantling of the role in the world that Europe played it is now less and less and less and the lead is taken by England which in a way is correct because they took the lead the other way they brought the European you know it went from a cold wet offshore island of Europe to the Great British Empire and now it's on its way back to what it was and the rest of Europe with it and all of these are ideologically mistaken Notions of how in the world you're going to cope with that line let alone reestablish a place and maybe that's the way Empires always go they rise they are spectacular they rule and oh boy do they look bad as they turn into the ruins that all of them before also ended up why not Europe too but we're watching it I think that's correct we're in agreement yeah thank you so much Richard Michael for being with us today great pleasure as always all right thank you I hope it was news focused enough yeah see you next week bye bye bye bye bye bye
