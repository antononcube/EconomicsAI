how do you see what are the main reasons of what's happening with the stock market okay um let me Begin by reminding everyone that the stock market is not the same thing as the economy and never was and you shouldn't read one off of the other they have their own sets of determinants that are not identical it is possible for the market to go up and the economy to be in trouble and it's possible for the economy to be in good shape and the market is in trouble so keep that in mind that's an important caveat because the short the short circuiting of that difference is common in the media they will infer one from the other you'll see presidential races in which one side says the economy is good why because the market is going up and the other side said the economy is terrible and that the market going up doesn't change that that's an awareness that they're different but it's being used in a crude way I want to make the case that you should keep it in mind because it is really the truth of this situation okay I'm going to mention three things quickly that I think contributed to the remarkable breakdown of the market on Monday and Tuesday of this week it's not yet clear where that all going it's bouncing around but the drop on Monday was unmistakable uh a thousand points on the on the measurement and so forth okay the first thing is to remind everyone that capitalism is a system of Cycles that's the politest word we have for this phenomena here are some other words bust crash crisis recession depression I could go on every four to seven years according to the National Bureau of economic research a well-respected agency of the US government on average Michael doesn't agree um between four and seven on average every four to seven years capitalism wherever it is has a downturn some of them are short and shallow others of them are long and deep the Great Depression of the 30s long and deep uh the the the collapse in 2020 very deep short the one in 2008 and nine deep and short uh well medium length in terms of how bad it can get so if you're using this four to seven year average and if the last one we had was in the year 2020 the so-called covid breakdown well it's five years so it's pretty much on schedule where are to make a long story short we're kind of doe for another one nobody should be surprised and if you read the financial press there are plenty of people who have done this little arithmetic and they know we kind of we could be due for another one number two we have a very volatile uh Administration I mean on again off again trade war on again off again tariffs the latest one this morning a 200% tariff on European wine I believe it was uh you know this is a politician who has discovered that thanks to the Congress the Tariff is something he can do he can be a cowboy with the Tariff because he can he can declare them without having to go through any sort of procedure with any other branch of government he just has the power to do it and so he will by the way it's 50% tariff Richard just he he's talking about 50% tariffs on Whiskey and he's talking about you mentioned the Tariff on Europeans is gonna be 200 yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah on European I thought I read the headline 200% that's right that's right Europe wi and I can you think of wine not yes yes yes I don't drink that in response by the way in response to 00 50% Tariff of of the on Whiskey coming from the United States to every Everybody the Chinese everybody is is tariffing bourbon in order to impact that part of the country uh which is concerned with fbon production anyway here's the point the uncertainty and there's a story today's Wall Street Journal that the Business Roundtable has been having meetings with Trump and the lesson of all of it is clear this level of on again off again produces what economists call uncertainty which is always a problem in economics and now it is an exaggerated uncertainty because of literally two months of on again off again no business in their right mind would move production from China to Ohio or from Mexico to New York based on this craziness because to move a production facility is very expensive and takes a lot of time in in short it entails risk and that risk would become crazy if you undertook the expense only to have a president like this undo the Tariff a month or a week or a year after you have undertaken this expense bottom line one of the reasons we may have a recession like one of the reasons for last Monday's collapse is that people are calculating that the logical thing most big businesses will do in this situation is hesitate not invest postpone an in a planned investment and as we have learned ever since K's forced us to see it a capitalist economy is always held hostage by the investors if they invest well then the circular flow of the economy works and we keep our jobs if they decide to hold back which their free enterprise allows them to do then we all suffer the consequences that they're not investing the money that the money is sitting there waiting Mr Trump maybe never will had that explained to him but he is increasing the uncertainty therefore the risk therefore the hesitancy and therefore the arrival of the next recession we're du for at any moment and what you saw on Monday was crystal clear an Exemplar of that why because the night before on a fox interview the question had the interviewer had asked Trump directly can you some words like can you rule out a recession this year and he he fudged he didn't give a clear answer he he clearly did not want to go and say oh don't worry it'll be taken care he couldn't even give that if you put that together with what happened earlier last week and I believe we mentioned it last time in our conversation earlier last week the Atlanta Federal Reserve Bank issued its prediction for 2025 they said a recession is coming they predicted a decline of the GDP I believe in the neighborhood of 2% which would be not just a recession but a bad one wow so now there's in the air all of this add the uncertainty and you've got all the conditions and then finally I want to stick in here I know it's I'm special pleading here but I do believe that we are living in the decline of an Empire and that it it it is the background music no it doesn't explain the stock market on Tuesday or Monday no it doesn't but it is the back there is the knowing worry some backdrop in the minds of you know Jamie Diamond or anybody else in Wall Street that maybe we really are maybe what a few folks are saying I'll pick one in their world Ray Doo very important investor Bridgewater one of the biggest hedge funds in the world he's he keeps telling people that's what I see that's what I see even if you don't believe him it's in the air you put those things together and you can have a panic day on Wall Street like last Monday and you better pay attention because typically the crash doesn't all happen at once it shows you it smells already in advance and that's what I think Monday represents uhuh Richard well that's the whole point uh and that's why I don't believe in Cycles uh Cycles are ideological uh the National Bureau was founded by Wesley clart Mitchell who said uh capitalism uh is a cycle that goes on and on and on thanks to automatic stabilizers we don't need a government we don't need uh government regulation it's automatic the the free market is going to handle everything well you and I have spent our entire life talking about the long picture of where is capitalism going that's not a cycle all each cycle cyclical recovery in the United States is started from a higher and higher and higher level of debt the uh it's not simply that the Western Empire is going down the Western economies are going down because they've been so highly polarized of the 90 90% of the population has not increased its part of GDP it's all been the upper 10% of the population and that's been polarizing uh gaining from the stock market as you pointed out that really isn't the economy the stock market is the economy for the 10% not the 90% so uh I I think there's an aware uh the problem goes much deeper than a cycle it's the fact that we're seeing the end of the whole post 1945 expansion of Western capitalism that was based on a uh uh uh unsustainable financialization debt increase uh increase in rent seeking leading to de-industrialization uh and as a result of this de-industrialization when you have Trump's Imports now which was the question that Neema asked you're going to have a break uh in supplies you've already seen uh the Ontario uh government Ford uh saying well we we're going to turn off the electricity to Upstate New York we're not going to just uh increase the price of uh Canadian electricity 25% we can just turn it off uh the the uh the tariffs that Trump want threatened to put on auto trade as we said uh prevent machine parts coming up there going to be all sorts of breakes in the supply chain that cause the whole chain to stop operating whole everything to stop and there's a feeling in all of the news reports that somehow what musk is doing by uh just uh uh cutting uh government activity uh apart by uh by creating chaos is going to create chaos that interrupts activity and uh it'll be just as you said Richard nobody's going to know going to try to invest in the United States without knowing exactly what they're going to do so how is EUR since we're talking about the West what's Europe doing well you have merits and in Germany and uh lavro saying well we can we can uh have a re Revival of European capitalism uh by military spending spending uh 900 billion EUR for military spending and uh maybe we can't produce cars anymore but Volkswagen and other companies can shift to military spending uh to uh support the fantasy that Russia May invade us and we're going to need tanks to fight uh the Russian invasion well this can't really save capitalism because it's nonsense uh so I think there there's a a deeper fight here that uh you and I have spoken about for years and years and years uh and it's what kind of world are we going to have uh and way back in the 1960s I can remember discussions uh what kind of socialism is the world going to have is a final choice is it going to be the pr labor Social Democratic socialism that most of the world expected after World War II a kind of mixed economy uh such as has made China so successful or is it going to be the pro- financial national socialism that seemed to have Lost World War II but was uh somehow sustained by the United States and uh rescuing uh the uh the Nazis and the banderites and bringing them to the US and Latin America and other uh countries to try to prepare for the final battle against against socialism uh and right now you're seeing the Trump Administration uh we didn't talk about this militarily but it's been promoting a worldwide right-wing uh movement to dismantle democratic government this and shift economic planning away from uh from government and elected representatives to financial Elites via the military Elites that are running the EU we talked about this last time on on Nima so I I think all of a sudden let's let's take what's happening in Ukraine and let's put it in this big uh economic political picture of uh uh what is going to be the fate of uh Western capitalism and it uh it looks desperate to me and if you look at all of this as a kind of desperate way of how can we somehow survive how can we get by at least to the next uh election campaign um short term as it is how can we solve the fact that the the West has uh e become economically self-destructive because of the economic forces that you and I spent so many decades describing yeah I think what what I think would be worth our talking about both today and perhaps in a future show would be one key point that you made I think we need to examine why it is that you have the you Michael have the Judgment that Ukraine the war in Ukraine is linked to the notion that all of Europe is at at Peril from Russia which in turn is linked to an attempt to revive European capitalism which looks pretty sorry as it as it crumbles between between the US on the one hand and the and the China bricks on the other that they're going to rescue all of that by a massive uh debt debt funded defense buildup I I think exploring that would not only be useful obviously to our European audience which I'm sure Nima knows is considerable but also to the rest of the world because even though Europe isn't the the colonial master of everything in the world that it once pretended to be it's still an important Block in the world economy the US the Chinese and then the Europeans at least until others arrive I think that would be very very important because the effort led by Merz in Germany will be picked up by starmer and and macron and the others because they're in the same kind of boat and they are going to have to stimulate and they're going to have to come up with the government they're gonna have to come up with a rationale for doing that and given the weakness of the left it's more likely than not that they will do the merchs although in France once maon is out of there it could go in a quite different direction I agree do you think Michael do you think the way that Donald Trump is dealing with Canada do you think that would lead to Canada just Aban what Donald Trump wants to do with them or we're going to see much more chaos in terms of the Tariff the this fight of some sort of tariffs putting on each other well the mentality of Canada is toh submit and surrender to anything the United States does except the way in which Trump has uh set the antagonism with Canada makes it politically necessary to uh be self assertive just as you're having Greenland self assertive uh it's as if Trump has tried to mobilize Canadian nationalism and give it a backbone uh that it has not had for over half a century so uh I think that Canada will uh try to retaliate because Canada uh has the ability to uh create a break in the chain of Supply in America uh most of America's steel uh 50% of America steel comes from Canada uh 11% of America's aluminum comes from Canada uh and if uh Trump really imposes these crazy tariffs on steel and aluminum which are going to increase the price of every manufactured good made out of steel and aluminum and half of every car is made out of steel uh and put together uh with parts made across the Canadian or Mexican borders as we've discussed uh I don't see how the the car companies uh can uh continue to uh produce for a market and uh how other manufacturers are going to be able to uh function and Trump's fantasy is okay we've increased the price of importing aluminum and steel and oart so highly that the only way that uh manufacturing companies and car companies and uh air airplane companies can make a profit is to leave uh to relocate in the United States behind the Tariff wall uh Trump believes it'll probably take one week to build a new steel plant here uh the the 20 steel plants one week they're going to make new aluminum refineries that are made out of electricity I think you'll have to cut back half of America's Home electricity consumption to make the aluminum but one week we can do it and the recession will be over instantaneously this is crazy there's no uh saying okay here is the sequin in order if you want to industrialize America here are the things that have to happen you need a factory to produce industrial goods you have to build a factory that you have to get planning permission uh uh and you have to get a labor force that's going to uh do this some that somehow is trained you can't just send people into a steel factory and say okay here's the job you have to do it'll be like the people will go to work for the healthcare companies you call them and ask them a question and they say oh we just joined we we don't know what's happening uh it's it's Anarchy and uh the the Tariff situation is creating an anarchy that uh it's he he has a 20-year plan that has to work within two months that's not this is really crazy and this is uh this is the aspect of trump that's coming out not the long-term uh strategist how do I get rid of all my enemies and the uh uh neocon deep State uh nothing meshes together let let me let me go at this in another way if you keep performing the way Mr Trump is with with the on again off again forget whether it gets worse and worse in terms of a higher and higher tariffs even the the uncertainty of whatever the level is on and off and on and off off you are teaching the world a lesson in addition to what we've been talking about in terms of a declining Empire if the G7 now accounts for 28% of total output in the world but the Chinese and Bricks together account for 35% of the total output of the world which are roughly what the numbers are then then you are training the world into re-evaluating their each country's situation who are we borrowing from who are we selling to who are we buying from because the very uncertainty of Mr Trump's behavior on top of the shifting Global wealth allocation means that countries need to do to make a long story short more business with China and the bricks and less business with the G7 because all anything else is stupid anything else puts you at a level of risk you have no so you would rather be selling to the rising bricks configuration that so CH so Canada Canada produces electricity who needs electricity China and the bricks they're desperate for electricity sell it to them which they can do if you have steel and aluminum that the Americans are an uncertain market for shift and Michael is right that you don't shift everything all at once that's too expensive that's too risky but if everybody shifts 5% 10% of their business from one of these areas to the other the impact of accumulated on the United States will be devastating but that's in the cards anyway take away Trump it's it it's been going on before trump it will continue after trump it is subject to forces he cannot control and the effort to control what you cannot is often reflected in the kind of Herky jerky that you're seeing because he set himself an imposs possible task it's a little bit like Michael saying you know you can't have a two-month policy to achieve a five-year program this m makes you crazy because you'll be so disappointed at what you get after two months that you instead of re-evaluating you can't do it you'll try some other policy hoping it will do in two months but that's not your problem the right policy your problem is understand and we live in a country that we've talked about this now many times whose reaction to the declining Empire to the rise of the bricks is a combination of denial about what's going on and then the Fantastic imagination that if you send the seventh fleet to the South China Sea and you make a lot of noise about Taiwan you're going to slow or stop this process you're not you're not it hasn't worked for 20 years there's no reason to believe it's going to work now you can pivot to Asia all you want it's not a it's not a plan
