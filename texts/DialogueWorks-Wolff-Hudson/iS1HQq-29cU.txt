hi everybody today is Thursday February 27 2025 and our friends Richard wol and Michael Hudson are back with us welcome back thank you glad to be here let's get started with what's going on in Germany people wanted some sort of change in the in terms of domestic and foreign policies of Germany they end up with the same sort of policies new names but the same sort of policies how did you find the changes in Germany let's get started with Richard all right um here's the things that struck me that the three parties that represent in my mind the conventional German political establishment that is the conservatives which is an alliance between basically Northern Germany and Southern Germany uh the the Christian Democratic Union and the Christian socialist Union uh all those words have lost whatever meaning they once had anyway but they are the conservatives uh more or less if you want to think from American uh perspective you might call them the Republican party or even the Republican and Centrist Democratic uh collection of people who have been used to for a long time uh exchanging the role of who's the president who's the second in command uh but it is musical chairs and most people including most Germans long ago lost interest uh they were the government under Mr Schultz who's now gone but as you rightly suggest it's the same PE it's the same program the same parties a slightly different and I mean slightly different faces uh and the interesting thing about them is if you put them together the Christian Democratic Union the Christian socialist Union the social Democrats and the greens we need to remind people that in Germany the greens have none of the leftwing aroma that Greens in other parts of the world cultivate and want to have the German greens split years ago and the people who have been green ever since are very much eager to be parts of the government run by the conservatives and the Social Democrat so they really belong together and the interesting thing is over the last four or five years since the last federal election in Germany all three of those parties lost dramatically huge portions of their voting base abandoned them that's what we just learned from last Sunday's election who picked up basically and this is so important because it's so similar to what is happening in other Western capitalist countries the voters who left the old Coalition were not a enough to bump them from Power that's why we're seeing the same old same old again with a couple of new faces Frederick Merz and and instead of Olaf Schultz okay but but not much difference when it comes to it so they they still had enough roughly half the vote in Germany roughly uh to be a government okay so that's why we're going to see in all likelihood a government of the Christian democrats the Socialists and the greens which is what we had before but they all lost votes the greens particularly but all of them and those votes either went to the right with the alternative futan English translation alternative for Germany which is a rightwing party that is remarkable in three ways as a political program other than getting being hostile towards immigrants They Don't Really offer all that much number two they have inherited the Nazi left whatever's left of Nazism in Germany Finds Its way into that party or at least a large part of it does and the third interesting thing about that party is that it is overwhelmingly based in the eastern part of Germany in other words in that part of Germany that used to be a separate country East Germany and that was only unified a relatively short time ago those people were all involved basically in something called the Socialist Unity party which was the old Communist Party of Eastern Germany and that's gone or or largely gone and these people have have felt in the East that they were very much misled about the unification of Germany very important to understand they were led to believe that by unifying East Germany would enjoy the standards of living and all the rest of it that West Germany had reached and but that that we all have to remember West Germany was given enormous financial support because it was crucial to the West in the aftermath of World War II to to isolate Western Europe from the infection of socialism and communism I want to remind people after World War II the first government of General Charles the gal in France had several members of the Communist Party in the cabinet of France that's how powerful they were the backbone of the resistance to the Nazis in places like France and Italy and elsewhere were Communists and socialists and so they emerged from World War II with a level of popular support that frightened people in the west just like the fact that Russia was crucial to winning World War II frightened people in the west so they pumped a lot of money into Western Germany giving it the ability to to make a politics that said hey you guys in Eastern Germany you may have communism and socialism and you know guaranteed child care and all the rest of it but we have uh a higher standard of living which they did I mean they did and the easterners then believed after Decades of of propaganda that if they unified with the West they would become like West Germany Rich comfortable at least relative to other working classes and relative to them themselves if I had time i' talk to you about East Germany it had a very hard time after World War II because it was part of the Eastern European Soviet block and yet the in inside Russia there was understandable hostility towards Germany which had subjected the Russians to an unspeakable destruction during World War II people should know more Germans died excuse me more Russians died than any other nationality that's how how bad that war was so helping East Germany was not a high priority inside the Soviet Union and show anyway they made a unification as I think many people will remember and the easterners expected to have the jobs and the job security and the incomes and they never got it because for the West all that Eastern EUR Eastern Germany represented was cheap labor those people had been getting much lower wages they were used to living in that way with low individual wages partly because because they got a lot of collective consumption the socialist government there provided education and health care and subsidized transport and all of that and so these Eastern folks were used to low individual wages and so the capitalists of the West said okay great we'll either put a factory in East Germany paying low wages or you can come here and we'll pay you low wages if you migrate into the West long story short you deeply betrayed your fellow Germans remember the East Germans speak the same language have the same ancient culture Etc Americans don't know but Berlin the capital was in East Germany it used to be the capital divided but westerners had to drive through East Germany to get to Berlin because of where it's at all right so this anger and this bitterness turned to the political establishment in Germany naively thinking that they could appeal either to the Christian democrats or to the Socialists to to to get what they had been led to expect they would get but they couldn't get it neither the Socialists nor the Christians were were prepared to do anything like what would have had to be done to deliver on the promise and so yeah we've lost R Michael well what is is quite rest there there were two groups uh that turned away from the Centrist parties uh East Germans are quite right uh the Western uh Germany as soon as there was unification Western investors came into the East and tried to begin buying up property at a a housing at a very low price raising the cost of living uh in East Germany but most of all they sent Managers from West Germany that were the least competent uh I'm most familiar with what happened in the in music and the Arts uh I went to a show of a performance of Wagner's ring in Dron uh and it was the worst staged uh Opera that I'd ever seen in my life and everybody was commenting on uh the heads of every Public Authority were brought in from West Germany by the least competent members so uh the the econ there was hardly any investment uh by the West in East Germany and the result is the local towns and Villages are emptying out and uh that uh that explains it but the other group that's moved away from the centrists as much as the East Germany are the the young voters uh voters in their 20s and early 30s uh move have been moving away from the Christian democrats and the Centrist parties because there's a real unemployment problem there uh the an enormous housing problem that's caused by uh by the rent in in West Germany there was no attempt to make money by real estate you know in America uh and other countries how uh having real estate is the way in which the middle class is is gained uh in ger in East Germany uh you could U be the official uh designated landlord in the building but you had to agree to uh be a servant of the tenants you didn't make any money by being the landlord the real estate was uh hardly worth worth anything and the result is that hardly anybody wanted to be a landlord they wanted just to be a tenant uh rent was kept very low because real estate and housing was not financialized it was treated as a public uh right a public service uh and uh that attitude amazingly enough survived after the wall came down and there uh I've spent a lot of time in East Germany I've met with the heads of all of the major parties there uh at their conferences uh annually and uh the the feeling that is so different from the United States uh that you could hardly imagine the the fact that number one uh the East Germans never thought of real estate as something that would become a major cost and in fact the uh the housing costs in Germany are still among the lowest uh uh in Europe uh and also the idea of equality between men and women in East Germany were such that uh most East Germans don't actually get married uh partly because of the tax uh situation there but also there's no idea that uh the the man has to uh support the wife that it's a the whole social structure uh is completely different there uh in in the west there is a demographic shift as I said uh the young people do not accept the Centrist and when you get down to it what is a Centrist it means you don't disturb the status quo but the status quo in Germany is polarizing and uh so to be a Centrist the Christian Dem Democrat or the social democ Social Democrat means uh you don't do anything to stop this economic polarization that's tearing Germany apart that's now been aggravated by the deindustrialization of the uh joining the United States war again uh against Russia and the leader of who of future leader of Germany Merz uh the Christian democrats is the the far right right-wing proar leader he says we've got to cut back social spending and we've got to uh increase uh the military spending uh very sharply we've got to send troops in uh into Russia and you can't imagine the bellicosity that is coming out of the East Germans Merit is very much like anal anal bearback uh of the greens uh a hawk and it's almost as if the leadership of of Germany really wants not only to block Imports of gas and block trade with Russia block trade uh with uh China become totally dependent on the United States to to a suicidal uh economic attempt and how on Earth are we supposed to explain this uh Richard is trying and I you know are expected to make sense of the situation and explain to people how somehow this all expresses some uh inner logic but the inner logic is so illogical so uh out of out of sense with the time so anachronistic uh is it word so tunnel vision that uh we I almost am afraid that when I I describe how irrational it is people will think well it can't be that crazy but it is my apologies I got cut off for some reason uh I'm sorry about that if I can it seems Richard it seems that your connection is still has some sort of problems but by the way Michael could you please check out your mic if it's properly connected uh is this much better here I forgot to put it right in front of me yeah yeah okay I had put it in back of the I'm terribly sor you should have interrupted me I forgot uh uh to put it right in front of this in front of M me everything's fine right now ra go ahead okay um well before I got cut off I I tried to explain a little bit why the sense of betrayal on the part of the working class in Eastern Germany ended up with them appealing to the major parties in Germany to correct this situation to deliver on the Promises that the leader of Germany Helmut Cole at the time made to the east when the unification was achieved and that was supposed to have been delivered to them by the East German uh Angela merco who was supposed to their represent the realization of the promise when they felt betrayed they turned to the conventional parties and they got nothing and so they decided in large numbers to move over and join something new the alternative and the alternative for Germany cashed in on this situation by playing a game and the game is similar to the one Trump plays here the bitterness of betrayal of the German working class in Eastern Germany was re refocused away from the German politicians who had in fact betrayed them and was shifted on to the immigrants on the theory that the immigrants were getting favorable treatment by those West Germans because they were getting the jobs and incomes that had been promised to the east Germans so they turned because it's easier right it's easier to kick down than to push up against those above you so the working class elements in eastern Germany to a considerable degree vented their anger on the immigrants the immigrants could be blamed for taking the jobs and incomes that had been Pro now statistically when you look at it that's that's a false argument but it it plays it's like here in the United States we are a nation of 330 million people we have undocumented immigrants maybe 10 or 11 million people there's no way on Earth that those poor 10 and 11 million undocumented immigrants account for the economic difficulties of a country of 330 million it's ridiculous it's so ridiculous it's left out of the conversation and that creates the open door for demagogues to come in and tell this fanciful story repeated all in all down the stairs and even though you have the spectacle of of Donald Trump coming down a golden escalator telling you how awful Mexicans are instead of that being a ridiculous symbol it touches a raw nerve it's a little bit like last week watching Elon Musk prancing around a stage with a chainsaw in his hand what an image he is destroying the lives of tens of thousands of public employees I mean what what a worse image you know for people who live in a world of advertising this is a mistake on a scale that justifies Michael Hudson saying there's a level of irrationality flying around here that has to be factored in because it is so Stark and having said that there's another part of Eastern Europe of Eastern Germany that didn't go to the alter naiv anti-immigrant it went to the left that's very important the Linker is in part strong in particularly in a number of states in Eastern Germany that should not be overlooked because some of those people learned something in their half century of Communism and they are supporting uh left-wing parties and then Michael is right the young people overwhelmingly the largest demographic supporting the Linka uh was the 18 to 25 year old people the youngest of all and in terms of the future of Germany that is a screamingly important uh statistic so a here here's a crude summary roughly half of Germany is still voting for the old traditional parties Christian socialist and green uh a little more than half and a little less than half are are split between the rightwing and the left and you would see it more obviously but for the fluke that German law says you can't get a seat in the parliament unless you score at least 5% of the vote one of the two major left-wing parties uh Sara vagen KES uh built around the most successful and popular popula politician that the left has and has had for some years years in Germany she got 4.97% of the vote she missed the cut off by three1 of 1% of the vot 17,000 voters yeah I mean incredible and and and so she will be outside the parliament but let me tell you something given the where Germany looks like it's going it may be one of those situations where not being in the Parliament is the best thing she could have happened to her in terms of the next election because there's going to be a level of anger and bitterness and disaffection in Germany if they go in the direction Fredick Merz is suggesting that is going to acrw even more voters both to the alternative but also to the Dinka and or uh Sara vagin connect because the look let me try to answer Michael's question where is Germany gonna go Germany depends either on Russia for cheap energy or on China for a market and both those doors are closing one way or another those do where is Germany GNA go the rest of Europe is it has its own problems they can't do much more than they've already done and they already are sucking up to the United States who's not going to give them any more because the United States is no longer able to support or afford laress that's what Mr Trump is trying to show everybody if you've been a friend of the United States if you've trusted the United States let me be let me be real clear with people the two countries that have most trusted the United States are not the Europeans it's the Canadians and the Mexicans they have made their economies dependent on the United States more than Europe and Mr Trump is turning on them and if you're a European leader you would have to be crazy and not they're not that crazy not to see that if he's prepared to Savage two countries on his border imagine what he's prepared to do with the Europeans that are an ocean away they have nowhere to go they if they say they're GNA build up their defense what they're G to compete with the United States that's ridiculous they're going to compete with Russia and China That's equally ridiculous it's way too late for the Europeans to be a third Force they could have they should have but their disunity killed them the irony is the nationalism that brought Europe out of feudalism to dominate the world that same nationalism is now taking Europe into ablivion if they succeed in keeping out immigrants because of people like Merz and maon and Milan money in Italy the eurostat the most important statistical agency in Europe recently issued a report if you get rid of the immigrants by the end of this Century which is now a quarter old by the end of this Century Europe's population will have dropped from 450 million people to 295 million in other words one3 of Europe won't be there they will be dead and gone that's the future Europe is looking at that's why they look to Michael Hudson to be crazy because in a certain way they are they don't see which way to go out and so they intensify the Mantra the song they learn to sing all their lives which are Russia is terrible China is irrelevant and America is the the leader of the world that's the only song they know and when it looks as Bleak as it does for Europe you sing even louder in hopes of drowning out what your brain is telling you you've got to make fundamental changes or you're gone from the historical picture remember Europe colonized the whole world there's a there's a special indignity for that part of the world to now fall into the position where by the end of the century we may be looking at Europe with the same sad view that we now devote to Africa I'm going to say one word about uh the left there since you mentioned it uh Sarah vagen connect was uh really the head of the lyns party for often now I've been in I've uh addressed the annual uh conference of the links I've had uh long lunches uh with Sarah so I have some familiarity with them the links uh Sarah broke from the link party because it's not really the left anymore in the sense that uh Richard and I describ the left it's uh it's come more like the party uh trying to be a party of the professional managerial class the only politician that has a truly left-wing economic logic like Richard and I've discussed uh is is Sarah vagen connect and that logic enabled her uh at the beginning of last year her party only began in 2024 really it began with a bang she made uh I think 11% of the uh one of the local elections in East Germany uh 8% uh of course she expected to uh be able to be in Parliament uh and have a voice what happened well in practice uh she did what Bernie Sanders was doing in the United States she uh in order to consolidate her position in the uh East German cities where her party was well represented uh she cooperated with the Christian democrats and with the social Democrats and uh the effect was to look at her like people now look at Bernie Sanders and AOL uh she uh they they they felt that uh she was compromising and uh she didn't achieve the rhetorical or some people might say populist uh talk that uh the the Del linkx politicians had and the lynx party uh did did not adopt her left-wing domestic uh polit politics but at least they said we're on the left we will not work with the other parties and people worried that uh somehow Sarah was uh like AOC uh and willing to give up her principles that is not the case in reality but it reflected her attempt to consolidate her position in what seemed reasonable at the time uh in East uh East Germany now the interesting thing is that 15 years ago uh there were Progressive forces within the Christian democrats party and the U the newspaper of the Christian democrats is the Frankfurt Alam minet situm uh and they regular they were my first uh uh big Publishers of uh interviews and articles there and they arranged uh luncheon interviews uh and Joint interviews uh with Sarah uh and me they they had real there were elements of the Christian democrats that recognized at that time that uh her left-wing logic describing exactly what Richard has just been talking about uh was uh uh correct but then the editor of the Foton section uh died U of A heart attack unfortunately and uh the there was no more voice in the Christian democrats to try to say well uh we we need to take the economic conditions under consideration that wasn't done and so now you have essentially the only person talking about the economic dynamics that we're discussing is Sarah vck but uh she uh the the West uh did not was not receptive to what she uh she was saying uh she did very well in the East not uh uh not in the west and they they went for the links party that has sort of become much more like the Democratic party here a lot of uh good slogans but not much content where Sarah actually comes out with a specific uh policy uh and policy program I just thought I want to con I want to distinguish between the Linka party and the Sarah vag party it's important because I'm sure from this she's going to regroup and uh try to uh become uh much more effective uh and you can be as Richard just pointed out correctly that you can probably be more effective if you're outside of Parliament and saying I don't want to be blamed for any of this uh crazy economic program that you're putting together uh it would have been nice to be a voice in Parliament to warn about where Germany's going but uh all we can do now is warm uh speak from the outside they don't have much funding they don't really have a party uh newspaper or a vehicle uh to uh promote their ideas so they're uh that's part of the problem that the uh Aid and the uh National Endowment for democracy is not uh given uh Sarah vect the money that it's given to the Centrist parties yeah and I think let's take this further because much of what we are saying with a few adjustments applies to other countries including the United States so please don't see this as sort of an e esoteric conversation out a particular European country it its relevance is that Germany is facing very similar problems to what the rest of the capitalist world is and and that's why I think it's worth while to have this conversation and to devote it uh here what are the Germans going to do they apparently are going to try to hold their disintegrating Society together around a mantra in which the Russians are you know at the gates the Russians are threatening the Russians will come the Russians will take over let's talk for a minute about the nuttiness of this the Russians are having a significant difficulty controlling a poor little country on their border namely Ukraine they can't they don't even want to take over Ukraine because it would be an unbelievable expensive in life in money and what do you get from it I mean my God Russia is the biggest country by geography on Earth it needs more geography come on it doesn't and it will it would expend all of its resources trying to hold on the last time Russia tried to hold on to another territory the name of that territory was Afghanistan that didn't go real well then the United States tried it and discovered that didn't go real well okay Russia is not going to invade other parts of the world what the hell is the point of it it would be very very difficult and talk about creating an opportunity for Russia's enemies look what Russia's enemies did in Ukraine now imagine to yourself what they might do uh in Poland or Germany or any if come on this this is a strange argument so but that's the one they're going to use cuz they can't come up with anything else and their country is in deep trouble look Marco Rubio the secretary of state of the United States gave a speech a few days ago didn't get the attention it should have but in this speech at a certain point he goes into a little Soliloquy and my ears perked up and I focused real well so what I'm about to tell you is a pretty good rendition of what he said he didn't use the words I'm going to use but the meaning was UN unmistakable here we go time is not on our side now he was speaking of the United States time is not on our side if we don't do something dramatic in a few years here we go everything that Americans take for granted EV their clothing their automobiles their daily life will be available if and only if the Chinese Communist Party agrees to make it available that's what we're facing and we have to act now so if you want to understand the wild heaving of tariffs wherever he can throw them or anything else that Mr Trump is doing then Mr Rubio is explaining what Trump explained to him we have no choice now of course they do the alternative to this desperate effort to stop the Chinese which has been a 100% failure to this moment that we're speaking staying with that is a strange move so here's my guess there will be people political people who will begin to see an alternative we can't win this so we better sit down and cut a deal with the Chinese while we still can that that is a better strategy and it does have the advantage of being less likely to slip into a war anytime soon eventually as the futility look they got terribly shocked three weeks ago with deep seek no one should underestimate not that the particularity of of how it does uh inexpensively does AI or you know all of that it's just another demonstration Huawei did it again last week with yet another chip that they produced you can't stop this that's what we're learning maybe you could have but you can't anymore and now transpose that to Germany what is Germany going to do given its dependence on Russia for energy and from China for trading partner the logical thing for Germany to do is to become the leading European to join the bricks that's the problem they either have to do that or or they have to suck up crazily to the United States or develop their own military which will cost them a fortune which they don't have the industrial base to provide for themselves and which will take money away from the social services that the German working class has become used to and that will drive even more voters either to the alternative na or to the Linka or to sarag they are in an unbelievably difficult situation and no one should be fooled by the bravado of words the storm of words is how Mr Trump is trying to deal with this and They're copying him no surprise but the futility for them is even greater than the futility of all of that for the Americans well that really should be the key to what we're talking about the role of the United States in Germany's future uh you have uh two demands that the Trump Administration is making number one uh that ger that Europe and especially Germany increases its military spending to as much as 5% of its GDP now since uh as Richard just pointed out they can't produce very much industrial goods because they don't have the gas and the uh oil and the energy uh that's needed to uh produce Industrial Products they're going to have to buy from the United States which is just exactly what Trump says we want you to rearm by buying American Military uh products very which are much more expensive than say Russian military products well at the same time Trump announced yesterday at his cabinet meeting that he intends to put a 25% tariff on uh European uh Imports to the United States well this is pretty and specifically Focus against buying uh European cars meaning primarily uh uh German cars so uh looking at the balance of payments which uh I know I always go back to that is the key for this but very often the balance of payments is the constraint uh the Euro dropped in the last few days as an exchange rate because people think how on Earth uh if the if there is a widening trade deficit by Germany and by Europe how indeed can the uh Euro's exchange rate not begin to decline uh and of course Trump will say uh the decline is an attack on America what he did say the other day is that the prime uh driving force behind the original creation of the eec the European economic Community was the agricultural policy the common agricultural policy that set out to do for Europe France and Germany in particular what our Rosevelt agricultural adjustment act did for the United States you protect your agriculture by uh support prices parity pricing that will provide Farmers enough to capitalize their and modernize their agricultural output and I think we discussed this in the last show uh to achieve an enormous increase in productivity well that's exactly what uh Europe did increasing its productivity Trump said yesterday that uh this policy that has been the key to the eec is as he put it an attack on the United States now this is exactly what the United States said uh after uh the eec was created throughout the 1960s the United States kept trying to attack uh the European Community uh because of its agricultural policy saying we wanted Europe to be dependent on American Agriculture and now it's not only independent but it's uh its policy of agricultural protectionism is enabling it to become a food exporter well you're seeing the the problem right now uh the uh the America is trying to dismantle the E's uh attempt to achieve domestic self-sufficiency to Trump an any country seeking self-sufficiency instead of Reliance on dependency on United States for food and agriculture for oil for a high technology good is an attack on America's attempt to control them to control the world and Trump says if uh if we can't make other countries dependent then we won't have the tool of being able to cut off the supply and starve them for food starve them for energy starve them for technology or expel them from the Swift Bank clearing uh agency uh Trump uh and the US wants to uh imp OS the uh the degrees of control and Europe is not making any uh official defense of this saying we don't want to be in a position that we're dependent what the European leaders are saying is if we uh lower our costs by impos by buying Russian energy at one quarter of the price of American liquefied Natural Gas uh or oil that's dependent dependence on Russia weaponizing its trade Russia has not at any point tried to weaponize its trade the only country in the world that has tried to weaponize trade and finance is the United States and yet Europe is treat uh European politicians are stating that uh it is uh the only country not weaponizing uh their dependency is the United States we're dealing with an inside Out World uh and again how do we explain how absolutely crazy this is well obviously there's personal opportunism at some point there a personal support from the United States it'll be very interesting to see as the United States winds down the aid and uh uh National endelement for democracy sub city of politicians whether somehow you remove this whole uh block of uh inside out uh politicians uh and somehow enable room for a logical realistic uh European discussion to take place uh I'm sure uh if you look at uh Trump's uh interview with uh macron yesterday macron was trying to say the usual silliness and going rolling I mean it's just hilarious uh to see the uh the visuals of trump while macron was speaking well uh I you you're the next uh uh meeting I guess as we're talking now is probably going to be uh with the England's awful prime minister starmer who's going to say the same thing as macron was saying you've got to uh fight Russia you know you've you've got to give up your attempt to make peace and tomorrow we've got zalinski with the uh the crazy real uh raw materials deal and that also impacts Germany because what Trump wants to say is there's going to be a lot of uh demand of money that needs to be spent on Ukrainian reconstruction the uh of the uh most of the uh real estate as property Destruction has been civilian areas in the Russian sector uh the Ukrainian Destruction has been largely in its military sector for industry but the there's going to be a large uh let's say investment opportunities in uh Ukraine what Trump and zalinsky are discussing tomorrow is how do we prevent Europe from getting any part of this reconstruction how do we uh make an iron curtain uh between uh Germany and Europe on on the one hand and Ukraine on the other linking you to the United States all of this discussion is to isolate uh uh Europe and essentially to treat Europe like Trump is treating Canada uh and Mexico as dependencies and there's hardly I haven't seen any discussion in Europe as to say they they are are cutting us out the uh the Europeans have spent most of the uh money on the uh the Ukraine's war against uh Russia you which is really NATO's war against Russia and yet Trump is uh a acting as if the United States has been spending it all and so all of the uh not only is Ukraine lost uh the war but uh it has to pay reparations for losing not to uh to rec uh compensate Europe at all but only to compensate the United States all of this is locking out Europe I mean this should be the the centerpiece you would think of European politics and it's h something that's too embarrassing to bring up in public discussion that's the story yeah and I think that there you have it again you have these politicians look they bet on the wrong horse that's their problem after World War II they made the decision understandable but they made the decision to bet on the United States that was their best hope and they did it and they forgot why they did it and they forgot all the hesitancies which is always a terrible mistake and they made believe they were all together in the same ideological war against communism and that was another mistake because that was not the real reason they weren't threatened by communism in a serious economic way that was never the case Russia was always much too poor and much too backward even in the 30s and 40s and in the 50s to be an economic it's not like China is a completely different economic issue for the United States than Russia ever was that has to be understood so they bet on the United States and like people who bet on the wrong horse they've put everything into it what in the world will will bear Bach in Germany the green party leader what will happen to her now that the United States has said Russia Putin's not a monster we're having meetings with Mr Putin we don't have a problem with Mr Putin what what before he was the Unspeakable monster now he's the he's the the the the the important Global leader that we have meetings with United States is meeting I believe today in uh Istanbul and the the name of the game there is to establish their embassies the the US in Moscow and the Russians in Washington in order to quote unquote normalize relations well you you have a generation of politicians who are not willing to to normalize relations with Russia even as they were dependent on Russian oil and gas they were so confident that they had bet on the right horse that they would denounce as monstrous and with with the international Court promis to arrest and prosecute Mr Putin and and now this has blown up in their face my judgment and Michael might disagree but my judgment they have no idea what to do now they have no idea the whole world is watching Michael's quite right I hadn't thought of this that way before but the whole world is watching Mr zinski who is not anymore you know his elected term is over he didn't have another election so there isn't clear who is in charge of this country by its own constitutions not Mr zalinski hasn't been elected he was elected in the last term but not this one so an unelected leader is taking the minerals under the soil of of a country Ukraine and discussing selling them or some access to them to the United States please notice the Europeans are not in the conversation they spent money but they're not getting any back only the uni what and let's also remember that if you're giving away wealth in the country that loses the war then the demand for reparations which has come usually in the last century from the winners against the losers then the question is where are the Russians but the difference between the Europeans and the Russians is the Russians already control a good part of those minerals because they have the Army there the Europeans control nothing they're the odd man and nobody should Miss what that means a discussion over minerals and forget now whether the minerals are really there or not and how valuable they are because apparently that's unknown but the conversation is between two of the four combatants it's between the ukrainians and the Americans led by a Ukrainian who isn't the elected leader because he hasn't had elections and two other combatants the Europeans and the Russians are not involved in the conversation that's craziness that's a little bit like having those peace conferences that they had in Switzerland and those other places where they didn't invite the Russians interesting you're G to have a peace conference in a war where one of the two sides isn't present interesting and then you wonder why no one cares or no one knows what happened at those conferences because it doesn't matter it's the same issue here it doesn't matter they're going to have elaborate conversations they have been having them they are now if I understand Mr zalinski is going to come and sign something and Mr Trump will sign something and we will laughingly refer to that in the future because two of the four players in this game weren't present and are not going to accept any I mean it's it just wow Michael is right there is something faral emerging here that the situation is so dire and the behavior correspondingly desperate that it's beginning to become humorous because it's too difficult to find a serious thread people who are acting out even Mr MZ in Germany acknowledged in his victory speech how badly their party had lost over recent years even Mr Schulz who was kicked out by of his party for the awful showing they made thereby underscored wow they're now gonna do something it's a little bit crazy you know last Point Mr Trump won the election over kamla Harris by one and a half% of the vote now whatever that is a mandate It Isn't So you see how the PO when politics gets crazy you have to say over and over again you have a mandate you actually have to act as though you had a mandate mate to take the richest man on earth give him a chainsaw in order to show what we're doing the richest man is taking jobs from average men and women in the government like you and this image is so bad for Trump you have to stop it what in the world is possessing you to function like this and the only answer you really can get is the sort of answer Michael gave there really is something nutty emerging here we're at that stage of a unwinding of a historical phase and maybe if I knew my history better I could find parallels at the end of the British Empire or the Persian or the ottoman or the Roman or the Greek where things like this comparable craziness is emerged not only nutty but illegal I want to make one comment about the tomorrow's meeting between Trump and the Ukraine it's very much like the concept of odious debt uh odious debt is when uh a government makes a deal that benefits takes on on debts and receives money borrows money that are used only for the government officials themselves not for the country as a whole uh or debts that are imposed externally on a country in the interest of the creditors or the trade surplus people with that country not in the interest of the country the concept of odious debts is that these debts should be uh annulled well what we're having on Friday is going to be something like an odious re resource sale it's a resource sale negotiated between Trump and zalinski uh how many billions dollars is he going to give to delinsky to pay off the kleptocrats that are the uh the current owners of these uh what resources that Trump wants uh to spread it around and what will Trump and the US get um the the agreement for Ukraine to pay reparations uh for a war that it is lost to the countries that have uh created a couet and uh put a foreign-backed leader zalinski in charge of the population waging a war that the population opposes and making a settlement for the natural resources and uh what Trump originally said is we only want not only the natural resources we want the ports and everything that makes money this is an OD ious resource sale that has no uh foundation in anybody of international law it's not in the interest of the nation but of its corrupt leaders doing Insider deals uh dictated by force and the urgency of a foreign government under military uh urgency uh by a pres by a former president that has no legal standing as Pres president only the Ukrainian Rada today has the uh permission to make such a deal uh not the the personal uh head that is a puppet of the United States that is the main beneficiary of getting something for nothing from Ukraine Trump is not saying we're uh in exchange for these resources we're going to give you uh the Patriot missiles and the ability to hit Russia and all the military support we're not going to support you militarily we're not going to uh let you into NATO we're just theand we're just making a deal between you and me uh zalinski to uh uh to transfer Ukraine's resources to us uh and uh that is an odious deal subject to annulment by any uh International court so again how do you uh make a a forecast of what's going to happen when uh as if what's being proposed is all legal and it's a signed contract that has no uh solidification under contractual law subject to international law and the the usual concepts of uh economic order it's what America calls I guess the rules-based order yeah I like that image of the Odus debt because it touches so many other issues isues and and I know that that you know that neema's program is is interested in a whole range of issues across the world but I'm reminded of those famous um Latin American Loans that I used to study where you get a cozy room somewhere in an elegant New York City hotel and on one side of the table are three or four uh Bankers from the big New York City Banks and on the other side of the table are three or four big politicians from and I'm afraid I have to say any Latin American or almost any Latin American country and they sit around and they're discussing the deal and they work out the deal and I'll give a a hypothetical number a billion dollars the bankers are ecstatic they're going to now get a a loan for a billion dollars out of the billion dollars the first hundred million will be an assortment of fees paid to the bank for making the loan the second 100 million will be a set of fees paid to a variety of the officials in that country that are sitting on the other side of the table or are direct indirectly connected to them which will also be fees for managing them and then what does the country finally get if it's Lucky Seven or 800 million do out of the billion but what does the country owe to the bank in New York a billion dollar because that's what the size of the loan was so the mass of the people are stuck with having to pay the taxes from which the interest will be paid to the bank in New York and the amortization the repayment of the 1 billion in principle the the a dozen people in that Country Have Become millionaires overnight they are going to become very important political and economic figures in their country among the 50 richest people the bankers in New York will become the names we hear in the years ahead because they're cut of what they just got is 20 30 million out of this deal they worked out because the bank is making so much M this is and then this goes on year in and year out and more and more the countries have to go to New York and have to sit down with the bankers because they are in debt up to their eyeballs with what they've done their own country C they have to borrow more to pay the debt on the previous one this never stops it never stops and it makes the United States's economy complicit in the most odious way with the colonial ripoff but the beauty of this is that no one sees the hand of the United States it's local officials in Peru or Argentina it doesn't matter who are having to have the meetings in their Congress and raise the taxes and oh fantastic it's an it's a colonialism run by the bankers hidden away unknown unavailable unaccountable until it blows up and then it's all over and then everybody gets crazy because no one has explained how we got to this you know we saw this in war the victims of war often become mentally disturbed because nobody explained to them where why is this happening why did a bomb just fall in my house what did we do how did the and no one has any answer for them and that's too much you can handle you you know losing your left arm but you can't handle living in a world whose level of chaos is murderous it's too much too much for human beings to handle I want to make one technical comment that makes the situation even worse uh than what Richard described he talks about uh the loan that's negotiated uh it's not the loan that's negotiated it's the size of the debt when the uh debt issue is uh issued uh it's ISS uh the buyers buy it below par it's it's sold below part par so the amount of the debt that is agreed on is much less than the actual Pro proceeds uh the loan proceeds that the borrower receives so there's that uh opportunity for a capital gain uh in time and of course as the uh price of the debt goes up and down depending on the risk there's a very active Arbitrage trade uh going up and down uh and I I think since uh Richard just pointed out it we're dealing very much like a post-war situation this is PTSD on an economic scale post traumatic stress disorder so you could say what we're seeing politically uh is the counterpart to what soldiers receive in Wartime I'd also like to just make one last comment if I could Nema um go ahead go ahead almost every country in Europe like the United States is now more or less anti-immigrant with varying degrees of deporting people the way the US is doing or making it much harder for people to come in or or both okay but there is one glaring exception and that is Spain over the last few years Spain has welcomed immigrants has brought them in has not only not made it harder made it easier has explicitly committed itself to welcoming immigrants and it is one of the best performing economies in all of Europe if you put Spain's pro-immigration politics next to Germany or italies or other countries anti you would come away at least with the hypothesis noticing how the two numbers move that being pro-immigration is a better road to economic well-being than being anti-immigration and if you think theoretically it kind of makes makes sense an immigrant comes into Spain like he or she would into any other country around somewhere between 18 and and 30 years of age young people it's too arduous it's too difficult it's too risky for children and elderly so it's young people and here's what that means and let me put on my Marxist hat young people cost the Society resources you have to feed them you have to clothe them you have to shelter them you have to educate them and then finally when they're say 20 years old they're ready to do what to come in and provide Surplus value for the employer but the beauty of it is the employer class get Surplus from these immigrants without having to invest all of the resources for the first 20 years of that immigrant's life the cost of making that immigrant a productive worker is born by the country that the Immigrant leaves so yes if you bring immigrants in it may be dangerous for your own working class the immigrants May compete offer themselves for Less work that's true that's true and that's a serious issue but for the economy as a whole and for the capitalist systems robustness it's wonderful to have immigrants it's one of the irrationalities of our time that what capitalism needs and I haven't even going back to remen mention the declining population which is a serious issue but even with without that capitalism needs these free workers to be producing Surplus but they have so badly managed immigration that they've created such hostility with their own working class that they have to expel what they need W oh that's a time that should show you you you've got a system whose internal contradictions have exploded on you Adam Smith made that a central point of what he was saying he said that uh the Protestant countries of Europe such as England were benefiting from the flow of skilled labor from the Catholic autocracies and in France uh you had the driving out of the yugos uh that became the uh the intellectual class the workers not only of Europe but uh into the United States and this idea of using uh that the uh objective of industrializing a country would be to draw the population in from the trade deficit countries was Central to the dynamic of uh British mercantilism that they expressed very clearly throughout the 18th century I have a whole chapter on that immigration point in my book on trade development and foreign debt all of this has dropped from current trade Theory we don't look at the fact that de-industrializing leads to immigration not immigration industrialization REI draws in immigrants and in fact the skilled immigrants that are part of the industrialization process uh you you have the propaganda today as if all immigrants are backward not performing economic any economic uh function at all which of course is a travesty of reality uh only economists think that way but they're the people who are uh making all the models today yeah I can we can wrap it up right now thank you so much richer and Michael for these excellent points that you were talking about and see you next week on Thursday kg take care see you byebye
