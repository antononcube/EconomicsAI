we know that Anthony blink Janet yell and Olive Schulz have visited China and they tried to convince Chinese not to help Russia we had this new visit of she to Europe and in which he visited France and then went to Serbia and Hungary I think the the the main visits were to Hungary and Serbia in your opinion if some of these European countries join bricks what would that mean for these new changes that are happening in the world well I think these new changes as you put them are are the crucial part of the story and I wouldn't even attach all that much importance to this country or that country leaning this way or that I think take a step back and see the bigger picture and the bigger picture um is this once upon a time uh uh after 1945 there was one dominant economic power the United States and it built an alliance with the former dominant powers and that was Britain France Germany Italy Europe Western Europe and for most of the last 75 years the United States and its allies whom we can refer to now as the G7 that is the United States Canada Japan Britain France Germany and Italy these seven are what was dominant for most of the 75 years over the last generation the last 20 25 years that situation changed with the rise the spectacular rise of uh China from being the largest country by population and one of the poorest on this Earth it achieved an economic rate of growth never seen before again I remind everyone for the last 25 or 30 years the growth of GDP in China has been 6 to 9% which is two to three times what it was in the United States and greater than in 99% of the rest of the world China became a modern Powerhouse economic unit then a few years ago it began very wisely to build up alliances very carefully with everyone and anyone it could find willing to do so and so now we have the bricks which is China and its allies the parallel to the United States and its allies but they call it the bricks on the one hand and the G7 on the other now the bricks had initially five countries China India Russia South Africa and Brazil and now it has another six if I'm uh keeping score so it's China plus 11 uh or China including China 11 countries the important thing is that this Alliance of China and the others is now a larger by by GDP a larger economic unit than the G7 uh they were equal back in 2020 and they have since diverged with the the bricks growing much faster relative to the G7 which are barely growing at all this changes everything every country on Earth big ones small ones are have no choice but to react to this changed World economy you know where your future is if you export you want to be able to export to both of them but if you have to choose you're G to go with the one that is larger and growing faster because it would be stupid not to do that okay that gives China enormous power if you want to import from those countries same reason if you want to borrow money if you want to get Investments it whatever you want you are now at least going to talk to the bricks people alongside talking to the G7 in fact you will try if you're big enough to play them off against one another right now Saudi Arabia is busy doing that and other countries do it I don't mean to pick on the sorties they're not the only one everybody is trying to re-calibrate what they're going to do and they're going to change and they're going to be people who go to one and then go to the other one because of the reaction of the two to the competition between them it at this point it's impossible not to make adjustments we are living through the adjustments and th that process of adjustment is also the dominant engine of change in the United States too because it too has to adjust the problem in the unit United States as I've talked to you about it before is that there's an immense need here to deny what is going on every Empire's decline saw many of the people in the country that's declining whose Empire is declining there were always large groups of people who refused to see it who refused to understand it who refused to take it into account let me give you just one example of the terrible miscalculation you can make if you don't think honestly about it the United States clear and Britain clearly decided that there was a reasonable chance that they could quickly defeat Russia if Russia Ria intervened in the plans they had to bring uh the UK Ukraine into NATO and the European Union why because they saw on one hand a 10-year developed Army in Ukraine that the West had equipped and trained and mobilized the ukrainians could never have done that themselves they that was and the weapons they use as everybody now knows those are overwhelmingly either old Soviet era weapons left in Ukraine or Western weap Ukraine itself very little some but very little okay uh the miscalculation they thought they would be def fight fighting Russia but the answer is they weren't fighting Russia they were fighting bricks Russia turned when they could not sell oil and gas because of the sanctions levied by the United States with Europe going along they thought they had Russia destroyed Russia is an economy that depends heavily on the export of oil and gas if they couldn't export it to their conventional markets they were finished yeah this is because you didn't understand bricks bricks bought the oil and gas to make a complicated story very simple I'm oversimplifying but it's the same basic point and the irony is it proved to the bricks it proved to them how important they are to one another it's not just Russia learned Russia learned what it could get from India and China but India and China Brazil they also learned what they can get from one another it changes all of their calculations including whether or not to go to war and there aren't any more important calculations than that so being in a in a state of denial about your decline leads you to make terrible mistakes the war in in in Ukraine is being lost by the ukrainians more today than ever before let me take another example at least the last 50 years it has been Western policy to try to separate Russia from China for obvious geopolitical reasons and yet here we are and the alliance between them is stronger and closer than ever at the very least Western policy of keeping them apart has been a disaster they didn't un the West didn't understand how to do what they said was a chief foreign policy goal okay that's another mistake moreover the alliance is stronger now not just the alliance Russia China but the participation of India I mean I don't know if you caught it but a day or two ago uh Iran uh and India signed agreements to do all kinds of things that means Iran too is now having help from bricks important it already had help from Russia we know but now from India give you another uh idea inside India there now a debate and it has to do with the fight in the Middle East Israel does not want Palestinians anymore to be anywhere near them so they have revoked the license of about a 100,000 Palestinians doing construction work in Israel they went to India trying to make a deal deal with Modi in India to send 100,000 Indian workers to replace the Palestinian workers in Israel okay the Modi government is thinking about it because there's money in it but there's an enormous movement now inside India led by the trade unions against all of this and so the real decision will be how does the rest of the bricks see this because this is a kind of favoring of Israel against Palestinians all right all of these calculations where anywhere in the world are changing we if you pay attention you'll notice that recently a number of Central African countries have pushed the United States out ner most recently well who are they bringing in Russia well why Russia because they want access to the bricks also and Russia is going to help them do that that's a whole that's an African countries couldn't dare do that before if they were like ner a French Colonial they went to Paris and worked something out and that required them to accept French troops on their soil Etc the world is changing radically and it's affecting everything and I think you're going to it's more important that people understand that process than to get too attached to little each little moment in that process there will be steps forward and steps backward there will be countries that join bricks and then leave and go to the G7 vice versa it's not well known but two or three years ago the French actually made some effort to join bricks so there's a European country that's already done it uh they were rejected by the way by bricks interesting phenomena so I think you're you're you're watching a change and if I may let me take it over because it affects other issues when XI went to Europe and visited with France Serbia and Hungary he was building a relationship with countries that at least Serbia and Hungary that already had elaborate links with Russia and through that with bricks he went to visit France because of the peculiar politics in France which make it necessary for French lead ERS to to to show that they are independent of the United States Britain and Germany they aren't and everybody who's involved knows they aren't but it is necessary to demonstrate in France that you are independent in the manner of char deore Once Upon a Time it it's it's the anxiety of people who are dependent that they need to act out that they are not dependent that's why and by the way it's necessary for Mr macron therefore periodically to do something nobody else is doing because that's another way of showing I'm independent so the other day he he did that crazy business with sending NATO troops to Ukraine only for everybody else to say no no no no no is the same thing now he invites G nobody else invites G he invites G he talks to G they have nothing to say to each other and it is it is humorous for spokesperson in Paris to have said something about separating Russia from China they are a a 100% failure at that Mr X is closer to Mr Putin than than ever before both both of them say so everything we see reinforces it and and Mr macron is rightly counting on the mass media in France to make take all that seriously the way the media in America take seriously what Mr Biden and what Mr Trump say when the whole rest of the world cannot believe it so that's my reaction to What and when blinking or yelling go to China it is hilariously absurd what they do this effort which they announce that they are urging China to change its ways China in the last 35 or 30 years has been the most successful economic growth story ever why would they change what has worked for them the only reason blinking and yelling are making trips every few weeks to China is because of the success of their system to go to say to people whose success is what brings you there you shouldn't do that that's too stupid all it does is make the world realize how isolated how out of touch how maniacal even if they didn't know that Americans shoot each other in a way that doesn't happen on any other country that Americans overdose on fatal drugs on a scale we don't see in other countries even when Amica people see that then to hear the political leaders talk in this strange way it's bizarre you know to have the American Navy 10,000 miles away in the South China Sea arguing over the status of what both sides agree as part of China it's it's really bizarre it's like the desperate efforts of a Dying giant to wave his hands around to give the others the impression of power and influence when you don't have it anymore look the desperate problem with Ukraine is that the United States is being defeated and the whole world sees it the GDP of the United States is I don't know 14 15 times the GDP of Russia and we're losing the war what what the West is explaining it it cannot give Ukraine more arms because it doesn't have anymore it can give them money but it's going to take time to produce the weapon my God a country 14 15 times bigger than Russia and I'm not speaking speaking of Europe you add Europe it's 20 times the size of Russia Western Europe and America versus Russia I mean what are you doing well it's the bricks of course that help Russia yeah but then you have to understand what are you saying you're saying that the bricks and Russia are defeating the the G7 and the whole world is is seeing it and whatever happens in the Middle East is not going to change what we're seeing on the much larger world scale There's 7 million uh Israelis and another 7 million Palestinians that's not a very large part of this world and even the United States population is 4 and a half% of the world and all we're seeing if you wanted a shorthand way of seeing it is that the world world is adjusting to the United States becoming 4 and a half% of it not the dominant Colossus that it was at the end of World War II and that that process now looks you never know for sure but it looks irreversible that's why XI can also go and have very quiet conversations uh uh in Serbia in Hungary because to be crude time is on his side time has worked for him for the last 35 years if he can avoid a nuclear war he'll win because he already is and the United States which needs to avoid a nuclear war for the same reasons is watching a process that is shrinking its footprint that is reducing its power that will it is already but it will continue to be the most important shaper of what happens uh let me give you another example because it's in the news today today the United States government quadrupled the Tariff on Chinese electric vehicles it also raised tariffs on computer chips and batteries and solar panels and other things okay you will now have to pay a 100% tariff if you want to bring an electric uh truck or an electric car from China to the United States what will that do well it's protection for the producers of electric cars and trucks inside the United States they will now no longer face any risk of Chinese competition they cannot equal the Chinese dominate in the world already in batteries and and electric cars and trucks they produce a better quality at a lower price than anybody else so the rest of the world is adjusting all over the rest of the world people are buying cheap Chinese elect elect cars and trucks and if you're a company that you needs cars and trucks which most companies do well then you won't have to raise your prices because you're able to get these things cheaply in contrast anyone who buys in the United States anything will have to pay higher prices because American Electric Vehicle producers will be able to charge very high prices because of the Tariff that protects them since they don't have to collect the Tariff you know they can produce a 25 give you an example suppose the Chinese truck it cost $20,000 okay the Americans knowing that that truck cost $20,000 to pay the Chinese who made it plus another 20,000 tariff to Uncle Sam that it will cost 40,000 to buy the Chinese truck they will price their trucks at $38 competitive with 40 but a big fat profit for them but that means every producer in the United States who needs trucks will have to pay $38 whereas his competitor around the world will only have to pay the $20 at the China you understand this is a terrible thing for the United States but Mr Biden has to do it to run for office Mr Biden has to do it to Pander to the automobile companies here who will make a big profit it reminds me of earlier this week the Washington Post reported a meeting between Donald Trump running for office and Oil Company Executives Mr Trump said I need a billion dollars to win the presidency but if I win I will cancel all the subsidies that Biden has given to the electric vehicle industry and the oil Executives smiled realizing that if you slow down or cancel electric we will all have to buy oil and gas for our vehicles yeah we will but everywhere else in the world they won't and that will hurt that will cause an inflationary burst in this country as the price of trucks and Automobiles goes up so will everything else and for those of you that care about the climate we know that electric cars are less polluting than oil and gas cars so we need to convert quickly we have Mr Trump Trump and Mr Biden competing to please the car and truck IND and oil Industries and therefore sacrifice the speed at which we need to at a time of climate catastrophy that shows you that the Republicans and Democrats could care less about this and here's the final thing that all of this shows everything is justified in our political system by jobs no matter what politician is selling out to what capitalist industry it's always for jobs I am doing this for jobs if you actually cared about jobs long ago you would have developed a government program to give everybody who doesn't have a job in the private sector a job in the public sector that's what we did in the 1930s here in the United States States 15 million public jobs were created for the unemployed we could do it again then we would take care of jobs and you wouldn't have to make stupid decisions about automobiles to save jobs it's a fakery this talk about jobs it is always done by people who have failed to solve the job problem so they're now going to protect and all of this are signs again of the relative decline of the G7 I appeal to all of you watching keep that in your mind it'll help you understand what's going on far better than any other framework to understand daily news and events I don't know if you listen to what John Mir shimer is saying one of the things that is so crucial in his talk is this falling Empire and Rising Empire and this transition between these Empires he says that it's not going to be peaceful we're going to have a lot of fight a lot of blood well I admire and I learn from John mimer um he is what's called a realist in political Theory or political science uh and and he understands a good bit about clashing powers super big Powers little powers and so on but if you listen to him you will also notice or at least I do that he has little or no interest in the economics of what's going on it's all about power about security about Prestige about alliances among Powers all of that is very interesting very important but I look at the same issues from the standpoint of the economic systems going on inside each of these powers and I begin with the Assumption which I get from history that whatever power politics is being pursued by this leader that leader and so on Putin or Biden or camaron or anyone is a policy that depends on even though it doesn't admit it on the economic realities of the underlying Society what Mr Putin wants to do is not the same as what he can do he may hold them both in his head he may be a man full of plans and desires and goals but he's also a functioning politician who has to maintain a kind of social complexity of his society which depends in measure on its economics so does he want to build an alliance with Russ China and India yeah but can he can he sell oil and gas at a price that makes it worthwhile for India and China to buy it and at the same time saves him from the sanctions that the West is you well he could what he wanted to do and what he could would do worked out but it is often not the case when the price of oil drops Mr Putin has to adjust he can't just go ahead all right now let me make the next logical point it's not only a question of the up and down of the oil price or of this of what about the more basic question is your economic system secure why do I ask it and what do I mean what I mean is are the people caught up in your system happy with it are they content or are they bitter and angry and looking maybe for a different system let me use the United States as an example I am impressed over the last 10 years that here inside the United States the conversation has changed dramatically 10 years ago almost nobody questioned the capitalist system it was simply assumed that is the way the world works that is the way the world always has worked that is the way the world will work uh it's the best system so far etc etc etc okay 10 years later there's an enormous part of the population that is questioning at this point I wouldn't go it's questioning capitalism isn't universally celebrated there's a sizable group of people who put down on public polls I prefer socialism I understand what they mean by socialism is all over the place but capitalism as a system is not so secure as it was now follow the logic suppose the problems of American society deepen suppose Mr Trump is elected and the country really begins to split because his notion uh is to take it in what others call a fascistic direction and that will be a problem for all the people who don't want to go in a fascistic direction Etc well here's what can happen and it has happened historically before the people's willingness to engage in power politics in in other words to follow their leaders in thinking that the great problem is Russia or China or Britain or what that could be pushed aside because the great problem might become capitalism and the desire of people to have a different system to not have employers and employees to have production organized as a democratic community one person one vote not some people employers and other employees a movement to replace capitalism with worker cooperatives for example could very quickly become the dominant concern of the people and they're going to say to you you may want us to fight a war against another country but we're not going to do that we have a war to fight here at home it's a war against capitalism and those who support it by those of us who can do better feel that we can do better than capitalism and want to go beyond it at that point all of the calculations the power calculations that John mimer analyzes and studies and writes so interesting ly about get pushed aside historically in favor of a whole another conflict that is more urgent let me put the final way of putting this I would argue that a good and me shimer doesn't do this but I would based on what I just told you that I think there's always a war which I would call a class war going on between the employers and the employees just as there was always a war between the Masters and the slaves between the Lords and the Surfs between the employer now sometimes it's very muted it's only anger over how long you can take your lunch break in the middle of the day but at other times it blows up we know that strikes unionization drives the way we've seen in the last two or three years at Starbuck and Amazon and all over the place we have a labor movement and a critique of capitalism movement that are growing together at the same time now here comes the argument I think power politics is in part a deliberate deflection of the class struggle at home into a nation struggle on the world scene doesn't mean it isn't real it is real but it is partly shaped as an distraction from the struggle at home and the reason I see it is because I know it can go the other way I know that we can also refocus people's ideas of what their problem is from the dangers of Russia China to the dangers of the employer class in the United States we're not strong enough to do it now but we are becoming stronger it has been done in other countries at other times it's even been done in this country at certain times but it has to be kept open as another way you might to go back to your original question you might be able to avoid the violence of power politics if you substituted an internal class struggle which might be a lot less violent than the one that we have now look at all the people who will tell you correctly that in terms of the class struggle Israel and Palestine are not engaged in a class struggle they're engag in another kind of struggle and that has to be understood and respected it has its own logic but it isn't the only struggle that people can engage in people can get focused on something else that's important in their lives the important thing in the lives of it of Israelis and Palestinians is not only the struggle between them there are other issues Israel is bitterly divided over a whole host of issues and if I were more knowledgeable about Palestine my guess is they have their internal issues also and we have to understand that the what happens in society including violence and war is shaped by all of the conflicts not just the ones that are in the newspaper this system is rendered ironically less stable because for example of the saber rattling in the in the South China Sea oh my God we have war with China over Taiwan blah blah blah blah but that's de that that's that's dangerous but for the people who run this country that danger is offset because it means Americans see danger over there and don't see the danger right here they kind of understand a little bit why there might be trouble with China but no one with with the exception of a few programs like this explains to them that nothing that happens in Taiwan will affect them as much as the decision today to quadruple the Tariff against Chinese electric vehicles that will impact them but they don't see it they don't understand it there's no movement that says here here's something you can do to fight against that the Republicans and Democrats are useless because they are both protecting capitalism and that's what a lot of this is that whole dimension you don't get that from John mimer because he doesn't ask those kinds of questions we and I again no disrespect at all M I look at his videos I've learned from them I appreciate what he does whenever they talk about capitalism they say it's free trade it's all about competition it's all about being free to grow and when it comes to outcome of this system after many years right now we see that the outcome of this system is the most important industry right now in the United States that is gaining more than anything else is military industrial complex that is totally defeated in UK Ukraine they cannot even outproduce Russia alone that is a fraction of their budget how this system was working for the United States and how capable was this system it was all about the system or a combination of system with politicians let's start with at the beginning of your question you talk about free trade and remember free trade was always an ideal we never had free trade the government always interferes in one way or another and it can't help it when a government taxes the people or taxes industry different Industries are affected differently by taxes and consequently you are intervening that's why if you get very strict in your libertarian mentality like Milton fredman or people like that they don't even want taxes or a very minimum tax it's just they want the government not to interfere at all but the actual notion of a free market that's always been an ideal or to put it in another way it's been the utopian dimension of Bourgeois economics these ideas of free trade free market so it first has to be understood that it was never altogether free or altogether you know unaffected by governmental interference the second thing that has to be understood is that minimizing which is all anybody ever did minimizing tariffs minimizing barriers to and entry and exit of businesses from industry and so on but minimizing that was always in the interest of the most efficient producer of goods and services why because without government interference they profit they win the competition because in that moment they are the cheapest producer of adequate quality output so in the 19th century Britain could become the great advocate of free trade because they were the dominant capitalist economy in the 20th century for a while the United States replaced the British Empire became itself the most efficient producer and therefore celebrated free trade but once once the others are better able to manage the free trade for whatever reason then you see the British rethinking everything and becoming you know protectorate the British for example used their empire to give them special opportunities a British producer could sell in Australia or South Africa or Canada in a way that a French competitor couldn't all right so the whole the desire to colonize the world was partly a reaction in case we can't win the competition in the free market we better have a protected Market what Mr Biden is doing with tariffs is the same protect your Market that the Europeans did with with colonies you know it it's the same Enterprise but here's the irony of capitalism your success your success in closing yourself off from others becomes an incentive for other capitalists to get around it so give you an example if the United States is dominant after World War II so that the only way for Britain or France or Germany or Italy or Russia or China to have a chance to develop in the world they have difficulties because of the United States in closing themselves off some of them do it Russia does it using its the Soviet system they are socialists the Chinese do it they are communists what is Western Europe going to do they can't do that because they depend on the United States for the Marshall Plan to help them grow and even though the the Chinese and the Russians can prevent the United States from directly interfering if they are going to be becoming no longer the poorest countries in the world Russia the poorest in Europe China the poorest on the globe then they're going to have to succeed in the free market which is what they did that's what they did Russia did it by developing the energy that the more manufacturing successful Western Europeans would need China did it differently China by the way China did what Japan did after the war the Japanese and the Chinese both understood all right the United States dominates they can impose free trade free markets so we have no choice The Only Way Forward is for us to outproduce them we must mobilize capital and labor to produce better quality at a lower price if we do that we can become rich and Powerful Japan did it and then China did it even better but China learned from Japan and Japan learned a little from Russia so it's very important the Chinese and by the way the Europeans did the same thing the best example is the automobile industry the Europeans after the war said how do we compete when American automobiles dominate the world America dominates the dollar is the Global Currency it's the com it's the hamon answer we have to produce better cheaper Automobiles and they did and that's why Americans the Japanese did the same and that's why you know Ford and General Motors are no longer the dominant Force they once were Toyota is there Volkswagen is there and they're all it's a new world because they figure now what does the United States do and this often happens it could respond by a a focused program of developing its own technology keeping keeping ahead but the problem is to do that requires concentrated focused State support and state policy and here the United States stumbled on its own ideology it's less a fair ideology the government shouldn't this was a terrible mistake not made by Russia not made by Japan not made by China China has had the government in there every every minute government control government planning whole Industries owned and operated by the government that can do what the Chinese did the United States cannot compete with that unless it gives up the whole ideology which by the way it is doing all the Republicans who support Biden with these tariffs and there will be many they're giving up all that libertarian it's turning out that ideology has to go because it it's impossible to hold on to the commitment of a free trade when you are the country losing the competition in a free trade world you know who speaks strongest for free trade today China China and you know why they're in the position that the United States was that Britain was before that and so on I think that's all that you're seeing is again the difficulty for the United States which doesn't understand that the free trade less aair ideology of the late 19th and 20th Century worked for the United States because we were the dominant economic Force but that approach globalization neoliberalism has now been a disaster because other countries led by China have been better able to use that framework given their governmental involvement than the United States and that's not going to change because the United States cannot face what the Chinese have accomplished they just just can't I have to go to seminars where I listen to professors explain to me that the only reason China is growing is because it has a private capitalist sector you you know that's desperate that's just that's so desperate you know you want to give such a person a hug it's ridiculous but it you know it's what it's what they need to hold on but they don't understand they're holding on to the policies and framework that failed for them just like no one wants to admit that President Biden puts a tariff on Chinese cars because American Producers failed to produce that kind of car that quality and that price and that's all it is it's just like when the banks failed in 2008 they called in the government to bail them out when the comp competitors of Chinese electric car makers failed they called in the government but instead of bailing them out with cash they put a 100% tariff on the car pathetic the actions of a loser
