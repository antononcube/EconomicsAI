right now when you look at Russia and China and the the way they're handling their problems with the United States and with the European Union as well we've seen the latest Che visit to Europe was to Serbia Hungary and France when you put all these pictures together in your opinion what Russia and China are doing right now and how do you find the current state of their relationship Michael you can store well I can see that uh China is trying to play at both ways I think when he uh CH met with Putin it's obvious that what America is doing to Russia and mobilizing the sanctions and even going to war all of that is in store for what's going to happen to China because uh Biden keeps saying China's our number one enemy uh now what puzzles me is is uh why China thinks that somehow it can U appeal to America's logic and self-interest and saying look we can both have a a mutual sum game Mutual gain uh by trading with each other and don't you believe in that the most Superior technology should win and we can produce uh what you need at a much lower price none of this uh is going to wash with the United States I can see that China on the realizes that this is not going to work and uh China is reported as being the largest buyer of gold uh in the last few months and gold prices have gone up very quickly from $1,800 an ounce to $24 an ounce because China's been uh running down its uh Holdings of Treasury Securities and other us bonds US agency bonds and Bank deposits and what's it doing with them it's move it's moving them to safety to buying gold because there's nothing else for it to do for uh with this money uh it can't buy uh direct Investments because they they're going to be hit by the same kind of sanctions that Russia has hit so I think that China must have talked to uh Russia about saying well we'd better move quickly on how do we uh reconstruct uh an alternative to the us centered order rapidly and uh China's uh exports despite what people think the exports to the NATO countries have been pretty uh flat but all of China's growth and exports has been to the global South countries and I think China now says well how can we maintain uh this how can we uh make sure that we bring the the bricks countries and the global South countries into our orbit uh away from the United States and I I think that if the United States is threatening to impose tariffs on all the um major Chinese exports sanctions on Imports that China wants to make and uh announcing that this uh trade war is going to continue I think China's only response is to say all right uh we agree uh uh we see that you're going to uh Levy uh you don't want trade with the United States I think it's in China's interest and Russia's interest to go cold turkey to say we'll stop exporting now we'll will'll stop importing from you because there's nothing that you're importing uh that we want that you're willing to sell and uh really uh draw the line there that would create such a reaction in the United States that there would be an interest group in in preventing this but at the same time China has to realize that it can replace the American market and the European market with a global South Market it can't do this as long as the global South has to uh keep paying enormous amounts of money for its dollarized debt to the United States and European Bond holders so I think uh China should uh and Russia should uh very rapidly create say if the world's going to break into two rival sections uh we we'd better create a whole set of alternative institutions quicker rather than later because as America does sanction this and develop its independence our leverage position is going to be weaker and weaker so I think that there's some urgency uh for China and Russia to work together and attract the other nations into its orbit by a a full scale split uh the west and I think that's why she hugged uh Putin yeah R should jump in please well I I like Michael's implied suggestion if I heard him correctly that the Emerging Market countries that faced with this mountain of debt that they can't Service uh if they declared okay we are we're we're declaring we're not going to pay pay it and we're going to use the money instead to shift our trade relations with Russia and China and kind of start all over um this would certainly be a major um retaliation if you like by the Chinese for the trade Wars and tariff Wars that we've had now for almost a decade the four years of trump and now the three and a half of of uh Biden here's some other considerations I think that go into looking at all of this in many ways starting at least as far back as the visit to China by uh Nixon and Kissinger it was the goal to hopefully build on the conflicts between Russia and China that became military for a while in the 1960s when they had their great disputes with one another and that one of the first things to say is that it's a colossal failure the image of X and Putin on you know hugging each other which I don't think either of does all that often but in any case hugging each other was a kind of demonstration to the world and it's very important that American foreign policy geared at keeping apart two of its most likely adversaries is a 150% failure it just wow in its way it is as powerful a message of failure as you know exiting Afghanistan and turning it over to the Taliban was uh and as many other things happening these days are the loss of the war in Ukraine which seems to me a reality and the and the deepening dead end of Israel Gaza which also seemed to me as signs of a failed ability of the United States not only not to get its way but not even to get stuck with blame for other people's misdeeds I mean it's extraordinarily hamfisted foreign policy to say the least um so I am struck it's not that I want to shift the conversation but I am struck by the degree to which the United States and I would be really interested in Michael's whether he agrees or disagrees with this the what seems to me that the United States has almost given up the ghost here here's what I mean you are beset by problems you know whether it's the dollarization issue I mean central banks have dropped the use of the Dollar by 20 or 30% of what they had before by most counts that that is being replaced by central banks loading up on gold and euros and Yuan and and Yen and all the rest but that's a diminution of the United States uh it just is you know replacing French troops with Russian troops in ner holy mackerel it's a small corner of the world but look at it losing as badly as they're losing in the Ukraine you know St uck all by their Lonesome you know and I read this morning that Norway Spain and Ireland are all recognizing the Palestinian State when France did not dissociate itself from the IC decision to hold Netanyahu as a as a war criminal and all that you begin to wonder what the hell is going on here I see the Chinese and the Indians and the bricks almost as though they were sitting around a table congratulating one another a that time seem to be on their side and number two that the United States's desperate failed foreign policy is advertising to the world that time is on the brick side that they're not they're just not able even to win small victories and their and their PR which used to be one of the great fores of the United States you know flooding the world with uh Communications with Hollywood movies with with every sort of um understanding manipulation is not doing its job real well it's not persuad people around the world look at the United States and they don't what what's coming from here there there there isn't there isn't a kind of dominance they once had and and and it becomes almost ridiculous because the leaders keep talking as if it were 1970 they are still giving orders and controlling the world and telling other people what they can and can't do and telling the the IC what it doesn't doesn't have jurisdiction over you know celebrating the warrant for Putin uh and denouncing the warrant for Netanyahu I mean that that's so gross that you're beginning to shoot yourself in the foot here you can't do that that that's not clever that's not sophisticated that's real crappy and I'm wondering whether I'm I'm reading more into this than should be but it seems to me that they they are losing everywhere and pretending that they aren't is really not an adequate response well the the question Richard is uh what just whether they believe what they're saying for instance uh both uh the um blinkin and Biden uh have said that the reason they're going to impose 100% tariffs on China uh and uh the reason that they're forcing uh confiscating Tick Tock is to increase American labor and Biden is going on the stump in Pennsylvania uh and other swing States and saying uh once we can block Chinese uh Imports this is going to be a great thing the less uh uh Chinese labor we employ the more American labor we can employ now you and I know that that's a fantasy uh is blinkin just saying and Biden just saying this to the voters to pretend to get their votes in uh in Autumn or do they really think that somehow after deindustrializing for the last 30 years under ever since Clinton uh that somehow the United States can reindustrialize rapidly enough to avoid a a complete collapse here uh as long as uh Russia and China realize that uh what is happening is not simply a war between them and the west but a whole uh shift in civiliz what kind of direction will civilization go through at go towards at least the civilization of the 85% if not the NATO countries uh and I think that if they realize this and they're certainly trying to uh create a shadow set of structures uh in the bricks plus countries that I think China is going to be the next head of bricks repl uh taking its uh place after Russia uh they they have to be talking about this but there's no sign at all uh of their uh doing anything like this so I can see the United States blocking uh imports from ter from China I can see the inflation going up I can see you mentioned D dollar ization and that's really the key uh if other countries can move away from dependence not only on the dollar but on the dollar institutions the IMF and the World Bank and uh the paying uh the foreign debt uh the United Nations itself of which the United States has a veto power in uh doing anything and even the international criminal court that it's obvious now the criminal uh there have been a lot of quotation from the criminal court saying we're only here to sue America's enemies we're not here to sue America's friends we're a Nat Court uh that's why we've never gone after NATO American or European countries we've gone after countries that want to be uh independent that want to be neutral and uhu I was reading the other day uh the review of the Dulles brothers and uh uh Alan Dulles said said that any country that wanted to be neutral is an enemy or as George Bush said you're either for us or against us and the United States is throwing down the gauntlet now and I think the logical response for uh China is to say well the Americans uh realize that the game is over but they're trying to keep it uh going as long as they can at least for the next election because that's what they care about their election and control of the US economy and I think what's going through the minds of the American government people is well the game may be over but at least we control ourselves and Europe uh uh and they're letting um Russia China go but they're there's going to be a fight in Africa in Latin America uh and uh Asian countries to try to draw them into the NATO orbit and they're trying to do everything they can to destabilize uh the Russian border we we've seen them try to do that in Georgia uh recently uh they're trying to do that through non-government organizations mean the CIA and the National Endowment for democracy uh all over uh the uh Global majority uh they're trying to disrupt that's the as the Americans uh and NATO go under the only thing they can do is try to disrupt and the only uh way that Russia China and the other bricks countries can protect themselves is going as saying feeling essentially what Russia has come to feel they've given up totally on the west uh you can read Putin speeches and lvov speeches and he says there's we don't see it within a generation maybe two generations of any contact with H Western Europe again uh with the United States we're going it alone but if you're going to go at alone you need institutions to do this you need to to create the same array of institutions that the United States created in 1945 to control the post-war world after World War II well for me I see an not differently from Michael but I let me put it this way um I know that for quite a while a significant number of major American corporations who over the last 20 years have p poured hundreds of billions of dollars into investments in China that are now to which you now have to add Vietnam India and so on they don't like any of what this is they don't want trouble they don't want difficulty they need to be able to build their exports excuse me build their investments in India and so on they want freedom to export the products back to the United States and to Western Europe because it's still very profitable yet they also want to participate in the Chinese and Indian markets because they are both the biggest and the fastest growing markets in the world so they have cheaper labor and a better Market that's a onew punch that every business school graduate understands is where you go is what they don't want all of this and and number one number two I think they understand partly because they've been ideologically committed to globalization and the ne neoliberal line of a thought for for 30 years but that they also understand the important Point Michael made that I do want to underscore the idea that by helping for example the automobile industry in this country the gas guzzling automobile industry by putting 100% tariff on Chinese electric vehicles I mean that's beyond fantasy that's downright stupid I mean let's be really clear the whole world is able to buy the best electric truck at the lowest price from China let's assume it cost $20,000 which would be a good price for a decent electric truck everywhere in the world companies for whom trucks are an input to their business will be able as they are by the way doing in Europe as I speak they are able to buy cheap quality Chinese trucks for 20,000 because of the 100% tariff the American company that uses in put of trucks which is most of them will have to either pay $40,000 for The Identical truck from China 20 to China plus 20 to Uncle Sam or we will have domestic vehicle producers who protected by the Tariff will charge you know 38,000 or $36,000 for the same truck that puts every American company at a competitive disadvantage with every other company around the world that's derable for US exports that's terrible for the future and that's terrible for employment in the United States which even the economists for the AFL CIO understand that so something is wrong here yes of course of course you're right Michael it's for the election it's to go to Michigan but to tell that story to Michigan is an invitation to every half wit in in in Michigan who has a radio program to make fun of this argument to shred it to show that it is a falsity that it's going to cost more jobs than it gains what what kind of a plan is this this is ridiculous you know solar panels uh microchips it's all the same what are you doing we're making solar panels more expensive for people to install by hitting them with a tower what are you doing what in the world are you this is so chaotic so UNS thought through that if I were Putin or if I were XI jingping I would be wondering on top of whatever Michael said that it it really is game over that there's something terribly wrong here I think it would take Michael and me 15 minutes and we could come up with better for for Biden than he does and that shouldn't be those people are working on this they got plenty of smart people what the hell's going on here I don't get it there the of miscalculation you go into the war in Ukraine and you calculate okay the Russians are 10 times the size of of uh Ukraine that's an unfair fight but we're going to give them Limitless money and Limitless weapons we win and we'll cap it off with a sanction and because Russia is a you know a gas station they won't be able to sell their oil and gas and they'll be dead and the rubble will collapse and the Russian econ that was a unspeakable miscalculation they didn't understand that Russia could go to China and India and sell all the oil and gas they want how could you not wonder about that given bricks given everything else given the long history of China and India what the hell are you what what kind of miscalculation is this and the morning after October 7th you announce that you will back Israel forever what are you doing that's not even necessary what are you do now you're stuck with it and you're staying with it even though it's losing you every wi away till Sunday this I don't want to beat this horse to death but it strikes me that there's now an accumulation of evidence of dysfunction my friends in political science are telling me that Mr Biden is systematically losing this election I mean I don't know if that's true I don't I don't follow that stuff all that carefully but I wouldn't be surprised because if I look at the economics I mean it is it is so disorganized so chaotic so self-contradictory that it really is right up there with Donald Trump's I mean there really is I mean they different policy sort of but not it's the same chaotic episodic fragmentary incoherence that that is explained by nothing other than grubbing votes and I get you know with Trump it's obvious that's his in the business of winning so he can steal but Mr Biden seems equally vote grubber to the point of just saying whatever he can it makes really no difference they miscalculated the support for Palestine across the United States in the colleges and school my university University of Massachusetts where I taught for many years where I tried to help build a union and I tried to do a lot of things The Faculty was never willing to do it last week The Faculty voted 400 to 300 no confidence the president of the University because he called in the police on Palestinian pro pro you know ceasefire demonstrators I mean things are going on here that strike me as requiring even died in the world economists like Michael and me to take account of something bigger than the economy which is reacting back on the economics to put us in the position of having to explain to people why a tariff on half a dozen items is not a jobs Creator that's too stupid you know an undergraduate would be given a bad grade for such an argument well Richard I think the title of our show should be something is wrong here that is exactly what's happening now here's the problem you and I are both materialist historians uh we look at what log IC Al should happen and what is uh in uh in the self-interest uh that's not happening here and it hasn't happened in Europe we've already seen Germany commit economic suicide by uh not by not uh importing Russian gas by uh starving its industry of uh low pric gas and paying enormous prices uh to get the gas from the United States the German indust uh emplo industrialists and their employ employees are immigrating that's not logical uh Germany is not behaving logical Europe is not behaving logical in shooting to be choosing to be a satellite of the United States uh and you you talk to the business interests in the United States uh and of course that's right you'd think that uh the business interest uh who've invested in China would be strong enough to loot to make the points that you've made uh to not only the president but to the public in large but they're not able to that's not happening any and it's didn't happen in Europe when the business interests uh universally lost out the business interests in Europe were called Putin's puppets and that's exactly what they'll be called here uh the uh Amazon and the other investors will be called cheese puppets uh you're why why are you advertising for the country that we're in we're at war with well you point out quite correctly there's no uh reasonable materialist self-interest in having broken up the uh world that was developing so nicely until 1991 and yet it America's followed uh an uh it self-destructive de-industrialization militarization well OB the answer is quite obvious the the government has been hijacked Congress has been hijacked we've seen how Congressman has been hijacked by the role of money in elections and APAC uh has outspent uh the American business interests and buying uh control of the congressman as we've seen uh in the near East uh I think that China uh is already very concerned about uh the near East as is Russia uh because of its role in oil and the attempt by the United States to continue to monopolize the world oil and the oil companies certainly act in their self-interest to look at the thought of inexpensive electric cars as being a threat to oil I mean if you look back in 1945 to 50 President Eisenhower huge uh expenditure on building roads and highways to to make America a country of the suburbs flight from the Central City uh all of that has you used oil uh it was the oil and auto companies that uh destroyed Los Angeles's public transportation just tore it all up so that people would have no alternative but to use uh cars burning oil uh as their means of transportation I'm sure that the the oil companies are still doing everything they can to back Biden's hatred of uh uh EnV environmentalism his abs abolute commission to uh loyalty to stopping uh this recognition of global warming because of the interests that uh benefit from it uh one way of explaining this would be short termism but as you point out uh that that's not enough I I think that the the it was really the neoliberals the militarists uh who and especially the zionists who are the root root of the liberal neoliberals who look at the whole world in term antagonistic terms and they never looked at terms in the way that uh president shei looks they never looked at how can we benefit from uh uh helping Russia develop China develop and the global uh South develop and and the world majority develop they were always a there's a desire for total economic and Military control and a total antagonism of of Russia China uh and uh the Foreigner and somehow they've hijacked policy away from the logic that uh you you and I point out would be in the uh business interests uh who so the real question is why uh how do we explain this wrong turn that the countryes taken what is it that has uh diverted the United States from the wrong turn uh I think it's the neoliberals uh especially the Russia haters uh there and uh the the attempt of the United States to control the world through oil and that requires uh Israel as the key to destabilize the near East and to mobilize Isis and the terrorist groups to act as the terrorist in the new near East against the Arab countries uh to to break them up and enable America to control oil it's a crazy it's a completely different game of World control from the game of how do we have the business interests are profit from uh globalism obviously America's now fighting against globalism and uh obviously that's going to uh not be in the interest of all of the American Industries that have benefited from globalism in the past how do we explain this uh seemingly uh unmaterialistic turn in History Richard I think we we can focus on Germany and what's happening to Germany it's so tragic because we see that the how dependent they're becoming on China and the United States the Porsche is producing its cars in the United States it's unbelievable what's going on with Germany because they can't afford to produce them in Germany and they are totally dependent on China right now there are how China is important for Germany right now and they cut the the the Russian gas and Russian energy to Germany right now the United States foreign policy is to pick a fight with China and Germany is right in the middle of this fight how do you see Germany right now well I'd like to pick up on that and also to comment a little bit on Michael's um I I everything he's saying let me sketch a possibility and see whether one or both of you think it's silly or or overdrawn or something um starting with Germany Germany makes Michael's case even stronger I mean I could I did I spoke about the United States but you're right Germany is it's an amazing act Germany is well positioned it is already by three five years ago the the engine driving all of Europe it's the dominant economy within the larger EU or the the whole of Europe um it's the greatest beneficiary of the end of Eastern Europe because the merger of East and West Germany makes it even bigger Colossus and gives them a highly disciplined well-educated working class to absorb and therefore you know build up its dominance even more it has the cheapest energy of all of Europe by bringing in the Russian oil and gas and it has an export Market especially in China that is exploding and that needs and wants German machine tools and German manufacturers okay so everything is going real well and then I was about to say it shoots itself in the foot but but I would say it gets a large gun and shoots both its feet at the same time it gets rid of the cheap energy and becomes therefore even more dependent on the number one Ally of the energy producer it no longer patronizes this is stupid Square this is this Beyond and and what for to do the bidding of a country that just blew up its gas pipeline to get even more of that Russian gas into Germany that's where the pipeline would have ended um that brings it's just wow so here's where I go the political adjustments in the west having watched slowly the hegemony in the 90s and into the early Century the hegemony questioned challenged slowly peace meal but nonetheless unmistakable you know and and even before the United States lost the war in Vietnam the United States lost the war in Afghanistan it lost the war in Iraq it is losing the war there are lots of signals of of trouble and the first reaction is denial and the second reaction is pretense that it isn't happening that you're still in a position to terrorize to dictate and so on and and you work real hard politically to line up your ducks and you line up the American political system very well and surprise a little bit you line up the Europeans so that all of the governments are either center right or rightwing or they're Center left that have adjusted to the broader right-wing shifts so that there is Center left but the center left looks a lot like the center right anyway so then they get a chance to reenact the Cold War they can all over Putin and Russia that's familiar they can liberate Eastern Europe that's familiar they can do all of this and so they go there and they celebrate what they have done and they mobilize political opinion and we now reach a point where they have mobilized it and moved the political um system far enough to the right that they can undo the period of the globalization and all the they don't need it anymore they imagine the problem is an enormous amount of those economies like the German we just discussed like the American are actually very dependent on that globalization and neoliberal they spent a lot of money and they readjusted their economies and they are now stuck with having to politically turn on what they economically have invested in so now my conclusion and I'm going to use a historical metaphor when the United States broke away from Britain it had to fight two Wars the war of independence and then again the War of 1812 and in both of those Wars Britain the PowerHouse of the world at that time remember that's the height of the British Empire tried and failed to crush this new economy this new Colony here in North America and after that gave up you can't beat them they tried they tried every which away they failed and so they decided to turn it over to Peaceful coexistence politics and for the rest of the 19th century Britain and France made money I'm sorry Britain and the United States made money for each other mostly around cotton and textiles and all of that United States used slaves to produce it the British made it sold it all over the world and this everybody made a lot of money involved in this game disastrous for the Indians disastrous for every other textile producers in the world we know that story but it was a peaceful now what's to prevent the American business class and the German business class from either separately or together orchestrating the political exit of the last generation the neoliberals all of them get the hell out of here bringing in whoever they need radicals if necessary who cares who will allow them to reestablish decent relations with Russia and China those countries need a lot of investment they can get it from here they're willing to take it from here at least they have been guess is they are again give them opportunities to sell their products here they will let you help build those products over there that's been working real nicely for the last 25 years why not resume it we were in but much better shape before these neoliberals turned on Russia and China so why can't we go back and reestablish that and then we will suddenly have the EMB brace by Xi Jinping and Mr Putin of I don't know Jill Stein or Cornell West if if they thought those people well no I mean this seriously if they thought a shift but you know there there'll be people in both the Republican and Democratic party eager to sell out if they could see their way forward doing that um and you know you could all could be backed by the Chamber of Commerce here whose public statements are in line with what I'm suggesting is what I'm suggesting crazy or is that possibly an image a vision into the future we might actually uh expect well you're describing the same uh logic of the future that President she has described uh my uh it certainly would be logical fors business to act this way but that's not happening uh the Commerce department is led by a China hater uh that wants to do everything that they can uh to fight against China thinking that somehow if we can sanction China we can uh do we can uh at least wreck its economy this is the fantasy that America had of the Russian economy it's a fantasy so we're back to my question why isn't this happening uh I I've read what president she said along the similar lines that you're saying I don't see hear any American company uh International Company saying what you're saying uh and I think they say if they say it they're going to be called uh Putin's puppet or chese puppet they'll be accused of being anti-American the the decision is already made irreversibly uh not to follow the logic that you said the decision is made uh this is a fight for civilization described as American control the American ability to control every other countryes uh economic surplus and send it to Wall Street and the financial sector so that the 1% can grow against the uh 99% and if the 1% has to sacrifice American manufacturing uh American industry uh uh at least it'll have the military industrial complex uh and it will have uh basically uh the financial support that somehow you can make even more money as an economy collapses if you're a finance then you can make uh from a growing economy the interest of Wall Street and the finance are uh against what you're saying uh the uh as the interest for the material of producers uh and I want to bring in again uh the role of the global South countries uh and the debt uh you'd think that c certainly America would want Latin America and Africa uh to uh be solvent enough to buy American products and certainly to let American industry uh and American investors take control of the crowning Heights in Africa and uh uh and uh South America but here's what I say Global South countries are going to realize that they cannot survive they cannot have any government social investment and can't have any alternative to austerity if they pay their dollar debts they can talk to China and China and uh uh they realize that okay if they don't pay the dollar debts there'll be sanctions uh and uh China and Russia and Iran and their allies can say well you don't have to uh depend on the American and uh European markets anymore uh will be your Market uh if you don't have to pay your dollar debts uh you can trade with of course you will have a balance of payments deficit with us but we're going to have a brics bank uh that will enable to uh fund your balance of payments uh uh deficit and until you have the ability to uh grow and create your own economic surplus so that we can all trade amongst each others other as uh equals uh and as Mutual beneficiaries that is uh to Americans the devil that is is hell that is independent from Americans so the Americans would uh sanction uh the global South the global South will then say U certainly the Americans will be joined by the Europeans the global South will then uh nationalize uh all of the American and European owned industry they'll say the era of colonialism is over just as we endered uh old colonialism in World War II we're now entering America's Financial colonialism that it put in place from 197 1945 to today and that colonialism has achieved uh control over our economies just as uh the old European colonialism used a military force America's using Financial Force we will make a by dollariz uh we will make a whole clean slate and be able to follow the same materialist logic that you've outlined that Americans should have had uh with China and Russia that do follow this logic so what we're really seeing is civilization developing into two different kinds of logic the logic of uh what you've described the material Mutual gain uh and material uplifting of uh Labor and Industry you're having that China Russia Asia and uh they're absorbing of the global South and you're having the fight against it by the United States stes that doesn't believe in any of this it it believes in either total control or or nothing and it if it can't control uh the 90 the 85% of the population at least it control its own population and the European population in something uh near to financial fascism here and uh as opposed to socialism in the rest rest of the world it will be a feeling of hatred uh in America against civilizations that are not following or permitting the American unipolar dominance and other countries that are multipolar uh but for this to happen uh the China Russia and the other countries have to create their own institutions to uh coordinate this uh Mutual trade investment growth and Regional planning and environmental planning uh I see the United States as being ending up very soon as the world's major polluter and saying well you go your way we'll go ours uh that's going to be perhaps the great fight of the future uh but the uh basically you have the ideological uh control of the US government is an IDE ideology of such hatred that it says America has two Democratic countries as model of uh the democracy we want to promote Ukraine and Israel those are our Democratic models well in other words you can't have democracy without total fascist control that's that's the split that we're seeing in Civilization Richard you talk about coral West and Jill Stein I think these two candidates are so important right now for 2024 presidential election in the United States I talk with Jill Stein together with Michael she's totally against these endless Wars I think the key issue is to put an end to these endless Wars whenever it comes to Ukraine Taiwan in Israel and whenever we have these wars we cannot have some sort of mutual understanding and some sort of compromise and cooperation how do you see this case for these two candidates well given the way the United States Works they have about the same chance of winning as you do uh I mean anyone Michael talks about fantasy uh it's not fair it's not appropriate I I happen to personally know both Jill Stein and Cornell West I have worked with both of those people in the past in a variety of capacities um they are good people they are smart people they have thought about all of this they have been active across the spectrum of issues they are the kind of person that a political system ought to select for and promote and put in a powerful position the most important thing to say about them is that the vast majority of Americans will never hear a single word they have to say let alone have a chance to hear what their image is of what they would do were they to be elected the whole thing is an exercise to enable um apologists for our system to say see we have minor parties or we have uh you know people fighting for election the one of the few things that the Democratic and Republican parties agree on and share and cooperate on is to be operators of a duopoly of keeping everybody else out of any kind of serious running they have in place both at the state and National level all kinds of rules and regulations and customs and arrangements to keep everybody else out or to keep them marginalized you can see what they're doing to Kennedy who has all that name recognition and the money both he and his running mate are bringing to the to the effort and yet he too is is utterly marginalized whatever the vote is that he gets so the sad thing is the closest we can get to a serious campaign is when Michael me and people like us can talk on social media which we do a lot Michael does it a lot I do it a lot uh and you can get some alternative perspective out there into the body but you know you're going to have to do that for quite a while we're in the middle of it before you get enough people thinking in this way to catch hold and begin to form the nucleus at least of political action political parties political movements in the proper sense of the term I'm not I'm not pessimistic I I think we're seeing it I think we're we're seeing you know the common place in this country of a black man murdered by the police did in this case produce black lives matter that's a very important fact that it did and that that was the biggest demonstr ation of white and black people about an issue like that that I believe we've ever had as a nation we have now been surprised by the degree of a movement for the ceasefire in Gaza and now that movement has grown to become a movement against the repression of free speech on American campuses that's very important I think I see things happening the question is can these come together can they have an appropriate economic Dimension and program and can you get it out to the people given the limited access that we have to public discourse and the hostility I mean I'm also impressed by what the university presidents did in case after case they allowed local politicians donors to the university uh police forces to be brought in against students who are engaged in free speech free speech on a public issue can always make some people feel uncomfortable if the if it didn't make people feel uncomfortable it probably wouldn't be the kind of issue that would lead people to want to make protest movements and demonstrations and Free Speech that's what happens when there's a controversial issue and the people who don't like the movements that develop will be made to feel uncomfortable but can you imagine white racist people going in front of the television over the last 50 years every time liberal whites in the north did something for black people or for Hispanic people and say this must stop because we feel bad about it they would have been laughed out of the room yeah you you you feel bad Jack because you haven't dealt with this problem you haven't faced it you haven't admitted it you haven't been active yeah you feel bad and we understand that that's part of what a protest does that's why people protest the people protesting American Independence made the colonial people feel bad what the hell are you talking the job of the police is to make it peaceful the present ation of one point of view and a fair safe way to articulate the other point of view you are a peacekeeper between them you're not a force to shut them down the hell are you talking you know and yet the ability of the of the media to portray this all as reasonable to deal with the university as if it were real estate that a University Administration can evict you from I I enjoy because I've done this all my life explaining to people that universities in America public and private receive enormous subsidies of government money first of all they don't the private ones don't pay any taxes that's a subsidy huge they don't pay taxes on their income they don't pay taxes on their uh property they're real estate in the local community nothing and then they get a a markup I've gotten I've been on grants funded by the government they pay the money for the grant and then they have a markup that goes to the general funds of the University if you add these up together at least for Yale University where I was a monitor of their finances for 20 years they made money every year the largest single source of income for them was the government they're not in a position to tell the public to get off their property cuz the public funds their proper I mean it I could go on but that's not the point the point is well I go back to my earlier one I guess I want to agree disagree a little bit with Michael I understand everything he's saying the logic he's giving is is absolutely On Target but I would like to leave a little space he's right it isn't happening I cannot point to corporations that see this logic and go up against the government anti-russia anti-china is the coin of the realm these days it's the atmosphere our political leaders all speak I the Trump people are a little more nuanced about Russia but that indeed smells bad too because of who they are and why they do it but I would like to believe that we may be surprised that you keep doing this you keep hurting the business interest at some point look the neocons are correct they have a few times pointed out that they're afraid not of XI jingping in China but of all his allies in the big business community here in the United States and they're quite right to be nervous about them I don't think we've heard from them yet with all that they have to say but I have to admit that Michael is right if they have to say it they've been notably silent in doing so for quite some time now and you kind of have to wonder whether they too won't be snowed under and here let me end with another historical memory there were many many of the top Business Leaders in Germany who looked upon Adolf Hitler as a weird crazy Austrian lunatic but when he came to power and demonstrated that he could mobilize millions of Germans they went along they went along until it was too late and they were done so if Michael is saying that could be happening here there is no way to deny that that could indeed be happening here yeah well the key words that Richard said were at some point we're at a a period right now a very very rapid change the world is fracturing quickly uh and I I'll get uh certainly uh Jill Stein explained to Nema himself on uh what was probably uh her largest audience that she's gotten uh of uh any media here uh she knows of course she's not going to be elected uh you're talking about getting her message to the people she knows it won't be all the people she knows it will be a fraction of the people but she pointed out a very important thing most elections in the United States are uh between Republicans and Democrats or president are 51% to 49% they're very delicately balanced uh she uh stated and I believe she I agree with her that the Real Enemy uh of everything that you and I have described as desirable is the Democratic party that's the neocon party that's the Hardline Zionist party that's the party of hatred uh she believes that by uh running and attracting reasonable people from the Democrats who believe in what you and I uh uh believe is right uh the Democrats will be uh destroyed she doesn't believe and I don't believe there is any hope for getting the kind of progress in America that you describe until the Democratic party is over and we have a one-party State at least if there's a one-party State it'll be like the American revolutionists thought that they were going to create let everybody in every sort of be uh VI for boats but as long as there can be a a duopoly is worse than a onep party State because a duopoly gives the illusion that somehow the Democrats are opposed to the Republicans and you're quite right you know and I know that uh Biden loves everything that Trump did he kept uh Trump's uh uh re arrest warrant for Assange uh kept Trump's tax cuts he he he kept all of Trump's policies except he cut back on the money that Trump was giving to people for Co he'd promised $2,000 like Trump had said and he cut it back to, 1400 I think that uh there has to be a political crisis in America for uh the discussion that you and I want to see happening here and that uh the way to accelerate and catalyze this crisis is by ending the Democratic Party that is uh the it and the the neoliberals in control of them people like blinken and uh Sullivan and uh Hillary uh and Obama they are the clintons they are uh everything that is fighting against uh uh what you and I believe they are the designers of America's adversarial economy against the rest of the world and uh that uh by creating a a political crisis that that will pay we expect to at least make possible uh either a discussion of the points that you and I are making or else uh there's going to be a very large immigration to countries uh that have not uh abolished free speech is you quite correctly describe the colleges having uh been doing by uh following their donor class in calling in the police uh against the students just as the donor class has taken over the Democratic and Republican parties in determining what candidates will be on the ballot uh for winning the primaries uh to uh to rep to make the laws the donor class of the universities have decided uh how to uh wreck uh corporations in a way the same way that private capital is taken over so many companies in the United States and wrecked them there it was the donor class that uh and it's uh politicians in Washington such as uh the Republican lady that have wanted to uh impeach the college presidents for not being harder line against the students and uh the they the Republic some uh anti representatives of the donor class have said that they are threatening to defund the university if they do not not pre explicitly prevent Free Speech uh especially by Palestinians uh because in their view to support the United Nations is to be anti-semitic to support the international court of justice is to be anti-semitic because you say that uh what Israel is doing with genocide is wrong that's anti-semitic to say that the people should be free is anti they're you is anti-Semitic well of course the Jewish groups here have finally come out and fought against the Zionist groups so this isn't really anti-Semitism uh it's uh what the Americans mean uh by accusing people of anti-semitism mean uh opposing the American policy of uh controlling the near East and controlling other countries and dominating other countries anti-Semitism means uh anti uh anti-fascism and uh that is not no longer the American uh with the the Democratic party certainly and much of the Republican party uh support so uh we realize that if people vote for gelstein uh and other third party candidates uh Biden will lose and we're going to get Donald Trump that's going to be a crisis maybe that that crisis is going to be so uh crazy that perhaps that will uh have a purging effect otherwise we're back to Adolf Hitler yeah you know I'm reminded that back in the 1940s and 50s when the rightwing could not stand the power of labor unions and the power of the Socialist parties and the Communist party they again had to deal with it all by creating the house unamerican Activities Committee you know as if these people who had a different idea of where America should go were therefore ipof facto anti-American whatever it meant it's exactly the same Ploy now if you're Jewish or not Jewish but you don't like the policies of Israel at this time in Gaza instead of being a Critic of Israeli policy at this time in Gaza you are anti-semitic you know what what that's a pure game to try to get more people to be on your side than would otherwise be by claiming that you are opposed to something uh that you're not and that you're you know you're dissimulating about what you're really doing here it's a kind of a cheap shot it's what happens in every country when uh political forces usually on the right want to shut down the critics who come at them from the left by claiming they're against the nation as if you know as if the nation and the particular policy for the nation were all the same as if the rightwing is entitled to represent the nation whereas the leftwing is definitely therefore anti- Nation you know it's it's it's what nationalists do to support themselves and they usually do it when they're in trouble yeah I think I think what you uh you and I are saying is there's really no middle ground it's either or it's either your view and my view of uh uh uh historical materialism of people will act in their self-interest or it will be this idea of a capturing the government for an almost religious belief in one's own right to dominate uh this is not only the extremist view of Netanyahu this is the American view the Americans have outdone Netanyahu they think the Americans are destined to control all other countries the uh the Christians believe that God has made given America this right this is almost a religion fanaticism of hatred towards countries that are neutral countries that try to uh maneuver between the NATO American countries and the global majority uh this is what is fracturing the world and I I think it's going to happen so rapidly that the business interests and the uh the progressive interests that you and I uh would like to see speak up they it'll all be over before they have a chance even to make their case they're not the owners of the newspapers they're not the owners of the television stations the television and newspapers are are run by this American religion it's the American it's not netanyahu's Bonds that are B that are uh destroying the Palestinians these are American bombs sent week after week after week this is America's policy uh obviously we need a kind of international court that can uh accuse uh Biden and Sullivan and blinking of us being war criminals not uh in addition to uh the Israeli criminals it's really the American war criminals that are driving and supporting uh Israel and everything it's done because this is part of the American strategy to uh use Israel as a pawn uh for the control of uh the near Eastern Oil and uh the uh the region near Eastern wealth as a as the region as a whole Richard do you want to wrap it up just Terry second one minute no I think the points that we need to make have been made I think the the situation is very very dire I think we have many signs including direct polling of Americans that they do feel that the the country is falling apart that the whole world is somehow in a period when when when Michael says we're at an inflection point or a transition point I think he's in tune with a great deal of American thinking even though they they would use different words or or concepts with which to with which to capture it I think uh it's very extraordinary what we're seeing I find it remarkable I also find Historical parallels I I must say I think that we we are critical of other countries which are Theocratic but we really are like them the only difference we have a secular religion they have a a religious religion we think that the position of the United States within a global capitalism is he Heaven if it's puts United States in a dominant position in a world mean even this business of referring to the United States and its allies which we used to do as remember the Free World so now it is the Democratic World against the authoritarian this this is religious this is Manan religious this is God and the devil that's what this is It's the extreme opposites one of which is extremely good that happens to be us and the other one is extremely bad you know this is a dead end you you you know this is this is not recognizing when you're in a dead end it's like Israel not understanding that three centuries ago most European countries were able to establish settler colonialism all over the world they had the space they had the money they had the ideological support they had the relative weakness in the countries where they the areas where they went but in 1948 to try to set up a new settler colonialism in Palestine every the world has changed the whole world is now against colonialism it is not in favor it doesn't see the colonial Master as doing the colonial subjects an enormous favor none of that exists in in many ways the opposite and you you can't do it then and remember here in the United States when the conditions were better the ethnic cleansing was total we wiped out the indigenous people here in this country here of the United States and so we shouldn't be surprised that part of the logic in Israel is to do there to the Palestinians what was done here to the indigenous people that were were here before and we we should understand where this leads and if you don't stop it sooner it's going to go there because it's built in to the settler colonialism as is a partti and all the rest of it you can't stop by appealing to the Good Will or bad of these or that individuals you got to understand this is a dead end this is not feasible in the world today just like you know the South African whites at a certain point they knew it was over they weren't going to Prevail down there may take an extra 10 years May kill a lot of people but they're done that's not there for them anymore they're either going to live in a a black African country or they're going to have to leave Israel has to figure out as it will I think sooner or later that they're in a similar situation the world is not going to let them finish the job which puts them in an impossible situation and they have no idea how to navigate they by the way they're falling apart inside the military have given ultimatums to Mr net yahu if he doesn't come up with a plan for what happens after the war they're going to throw him out which might give the West the opportunity to make the changes that bring the absurdity not to speak of the cruelty and the horror but the sheer absurdity of what is going on here which is by the way matched by the absurdity of the war in Ukraine since it also we can o tell you what the end result of that is going to be not the details but Ukraine is going to be smaller and richer and Russia is going to be larger that's the outcome everybody who isn't crazy knows it but the crazy people who don't know it are the danger that's right and they're still in charge I get it I get it thank you so much for being with us today great pleasure as always having you both on yes I I enjoy being with Michael and and neem I want to thank you for bringing us together and and doing all the work that I know goes into making these podcasts and I'm beholden to you and I want to appreciate it because I know I know that it it's an important part of keeping this going yes yeah yes you're the catalyst
