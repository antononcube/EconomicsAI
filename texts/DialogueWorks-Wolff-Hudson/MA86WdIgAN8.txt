let's get started what's going on in the K region between Russia and Ukraine this is a huge change that is happening right now A Ukrainian attack on Russian soil Michael I want to start with you what's your take on what has happened well it looks like uh Ukraine threw everything into uh a this effort to please uh the Americans if you look at the papers today every single Paper the New York Times The Wall Street Journal uh the British P the financial times uh the economists they all say this is a great Ukrainian Victory it is embarrassed Russia uh it's going to cost Russia a lot of money to restore the property that's been damaged that the Russian families that have had to relocate in the region uh are very angry at Russia and uh the uh ukrainians are going to set up a defensive perimeter in Russia instead of uh vice versa and the ukrainians are trying to using American missiles to try to hit the cursed Bridge which uh I think seven missiles were were down so uh to read the American Press you think it's a great uh uh Victory and yet uh from all of the press that I read in uh in Europe and the other papers they said yes of course Ukraine has been going in because uh Putin made the same mistake the same assumption not a mistake but the assumption that Stalin made in 1941 when he didn't expect Germany to attack and in both cases they thought Germany would have to be crazy to attack well that's what happens when you think that countries are going to act in their own self-interest Ukraine is not acting in its self-interest it's acting in the self-interest of who are behind Linsky and uh the kleptocrats there and uh obviously the the the phrase fighting to the last Ukrainian uh has taken on a new meeting from what I understand from today's news Russia has been moving uh back towards uh all all the rest of the uh Ukraine uh that has now been left open to Russia Russia's moving uh back very rapidly uh to take the city of padros uh that is is really the key to uh everything further uh further west so from Russia militarily it seems to be a victory because they've got the ukrainians uh attackers uh toward curse all in sort of a cauldron now they the ukrainians do not have a supply line they don't have any way of reinforcements and apparently there have been enormous losses not only at tanks and uh arms and missiles but also of uh of individuals so I think the American press and the uh reality press are really talking at Cross purposes about completely different things and when the Americans talk they say look at all uh the area the physical land that the Ukraine Ukrainian Army is taken by surprise by Russia because Russia never thought they would be so suicidal but yes they are that suicidal and it's going to take take another two or three weeks maybe a month or so for Russia to completely uh do the cleaning but at the end of that cing there's going to be no more uh ukrainians and so the whole stated purpose of Ukraine's Invasion to bring Russia to the negotiating table has led Putin to say this is really World War I it's World War I in the sense that we're not fighting in a third country in in Ukraine we're fighting uh against arms of NATO these are NATO bombs German tanks uh the ukrainians they're wearing SS U Insignia uh they're uh they're talking in German to insult uh the Russians uh and uh they've published a map uh that you and I have discussed about all of the cities that Russia now uh is targeting uh in Europe uh for the point at which war breaks out this map tells it all yeah richel this is the map that Michael was talking about this is an article in financial times it shows the this red dots on the map shows if something happens between Russia and NATO Russia gonna attack these red dots on the map it's so amazing that Financial Times is talking about Russia attacking Iran China and North Korea yeah well you know we've said it before but it's worth saying again famous remark I don't know who gets the credit but the first casualty in every war is the truth uh now there are degrees of this and I think Michael is correct we are now at the end of what I think is a losing War for the west and so so whatever constraints on the degree of make believe that might have existed before leftover Notions of what is journalistically acceptable are out the window and it is everybody make it up as you go along I mean I read in otherwise reasonable newspapers articles that claim to be telling me the state of mind of Mr Putin he is surprised he is shocked he is on his back feet he what as if you know what Mr Putin's meant why would you even write even if you knew what his mood were let's suppose you knew you would be aware that in the in the history of Journalism a reporter who writes what he cannot know is not anymore believed these are people who are so surrounded by others living in their little fantasy world that they've lost the ability not only to make the correct judgment themselves but to be reigned in by their colleagues it's extraordinary kind of of make belief let I don't want to repeat what what Michael said so let me take a slightly different tack this war is a war between Russia and the Ukraine I understand the West is funding the Ukraine the West is arming the Ukraine no question but is still in all a war between Russia and Ukraine at least so far in terms of the bulk of the Personnel right that's not a war that the Ukraine can win this is silly Ukraine is a little country and not very well off to begin with Russia isn't Russia's history militarily should have been a warning sign to everybody people who invade Russia don't do well Napoleon didn't do well Hitler didn't do well and I could go on they don't do well and they were much bigger much better organized and much less corrupt than the Ukraine right and the West which does doesn't want a nuclear war because at least so far they understand that this would be a strange logic over that miserable country Ukraine or for that matter over the Gaza Strip to have a nuclear war you really have to be unable to calculate even minimally so my guess is that that's mostly theater and it seems to me the last two weeks around the Iran reprisal for the killing of uh hania is more evidence that this is this is a poorly orchestrated theater piece so it seems to me whatever zalinski does isn't it not gonna make a difference to this outcome they've tried everything for me this is just another escalation at one point they weren't going to use Western tanks then they did at one point they weren't going to have f-16s now they do at one point they weren't going to let them shoot missiles into Russia now they do did it change the basic War situation no the Russians continued the Russians have made advances they are made Michael is exactly right they are making advances now one can keep track of the villages and towns step by step to the surprise of nobody and what the what the the ukrainians they need Miracles and you know those are a nice story but you don't get those and so they've now done the best they could to create yet another notion they had a great counter offensive that turned into nothing and they had various this is another escalation they found a weak point in the Russian defenses look if I understand correctly the line of of combat is like a thousand miles if you trace it all the way through okay even with with three or 400,000 troops it's very hard to to literally have somebody standing every three feet so they're going to be areas that are stronger and weaker and with American intelligence they'll be able to tell them where there's a lot of them where there's a little and you can punch a hole in and you can go in there and you can do some damage for a while and then as Michael says it'll Peter out what else can it do what are they gonna do take on the Russian army it's silly the thing is it's this militarily it's just silly and when you add that it's going to kill a lot of people and it is going to lead the Russians are going to you know retaliate I don't know exactly how but they will and you know this I suspect Michael may be more right than he even thought I think this is kind of a a last Harrah well Richard said that the first casualty of war is truth so let me make a quip the second quality uh casualty of war is lies and that's what we're saying right now uh the second uh casualty uh Richard also said how how can they uh Western presses uh imagine what uh Putin is thinking I think I know what he's thinking because I read his speeches and the speeches uh go way back to the cause of all of this the cause of this is that for the United States World War II is still on uh the the moment that World War II ended uh the United the uh United States the CIA the state department begin recruiting uh Nazis uh some of the Nazis were brought to America and to Latin America to lead the anti-socialist uh league but many of the Nazis were recruited uh the banderites were recruited in Ukraine to set up an anti-soviet resistance all of this was done in 1945 and that resistance has been nurtured uh for the last 75 years and we've seen exactly what's happening and when M Mr Putin discusses uh uh the origins of all of this uh he's saying this is not simply a war that broke out uh in 2022 it didn't even break out with the maidan massacre of 2015 it it broke out right at the beginning of the western support uh of the banderites and we have to look at it in its long perspective and because of uh the characteristic of the uh banderite centered in laav uh the uh the Galan population that always was uh if not anti- uh anti- polish was anti-russian uh it it's taken on uh the Nazi character of being anti-ethnic anti-racial treating the Russians as subhuman this is the Nazi philosophy and uh that's what makes uh Ukraine a democracy the same kind of democracy that you have in Israel defined as a country that's willing to treat all uh ethnic differences as subhuman uh and the fact that both of these countries are being not only supported by the United States but pressing for a war to expand uh the whole uh uh Arena of War uh makes me realize that uh what Putin has been saying almost every week in the speeches is uh the West wants us to retaliate we know that they have a game plan to retaliate we're not going to retaliate uh if with the kind of heavy perhaps atomic war that they want until we are all set to meet them on the same terms that's why he released the map you want atomic war we're going to tell you just where we're going to bomb just what basis we're going to take out just what European cities are going to take out we sort of have an agreement with America we won't bomb America and you you won't bomb Russia but uh we're we're each of us willing to fight to the last European certainly the last German uh in all of this uh just as U the Americans are trying to Spur uh a region war in uh in the near East it's all part of the same uh last you could say the last to off for the Biden Harris Administration yeah I I again I would just add I agree with all of that I think that's part of the reality of of of what is going on I do think that for both the Israelis if we're mixing the two together and zinski they desperately need to bring the United States in they are small countries they're surrounded by people whom they have made even into more harsh enemies than they would have been before I mean can you imag I try to imagine Palestinians or other Arabs or broader Muslims watching this for two years and a half now this unmitigated Slaughter endorsed verbally but also materially by the west and by the United States I mean you're going to have a harder and harder time and and what are you you're a little country in both cases you're a little country with limited resources even if that includes an Israeli atomic bomb you know it is much more vulnerable than the damage it can do and and it therefore needs to bring the United States in and my guess is the people in Washington they know that they may not deal but they know that this is the game and they don't want to be brought in because they don't want to pay the price especially not because these are not the major assets that that for them that are all that important they're symbolically important they have to do something to avoid being associated with abandoning your ally I understand that problem on the other hand how much are you willing to pay and maybe one of the rationals to bring in a new governing team whatever else went into those decisions I don't personally believe it was the the age and incapacity of Mr Biden since his age and incapacity have been there for quite some time now I mean we've been having a presidential race in which the real race is whose cognitive decline is the quicker uh between them it's sort of silly kind of politics but I think we now have a new face not only to win the election but to be able to begin to adjust the policy because this is one immense failure and and that's why I said last harah in in this failed story where they're gonna have to be a ceasefire or two of them and they're going to have to be negotiations and they're not going to go very well I mean remember every war the Israelis fought before was short this one isn't short and that's not because the Israelis didn't want it to be long it's or short it's just they can't they are generating new recruits for Hamas much faster than they are getting rid of old ones and you know this is a classic problem for people in their position and they're not that stupid not to know all of this so I think this incursion to KK is a necessary theatric it's something to be positive about it's something to have something otherwise it's this endlessly dreary  which is in an article of you know 15 column inches and then the last inch tells you how much further west the Russians have gotten in the last two weeks you know it's very similar week after week what puzzles me is that the election isn't scheduled for tomorrow another a few months uh the uh I don't think there is going to be a negotiated piece uh Putin has said that the only uh uh solution to what's happening is going to be on the battlefield he said we cannot negotiate with uh Ukraine because they don't have a leader we can't negotiate with the United States because it's not agreement capable and the United States doesn't keep its agreement we can't even agree on an atomic disarmament missile disarmament because they cheat and they don't they just withdraw from it whenever they want so uh there there's not going to be uh a negotiation the Putin has said uh we have absolute terms and uh his former uh prime minister medv has spilled them out in much more open details good cup bad cup uh than than he has uh so we should remember that Putin is the good cop Med the bad cop but they're all in agreement that uh this will be settled on the battlefield and uh President Putin has said one thing is there are not going to be any more Nazis in the Ukraine they will be tried as war criminals we know who they are uh we are going to uh uh either arrest them or do something else with them uh and we're also going to protect ourselves by controlling the whole northern and western shore of the Black Sea to make sure that there cannot be any other NATO threat uh to our use of the Black Sea and and uh us and we're going to make sure that there's a sterilized Zone Beyond which there cannot be uh any U missiles capable of hitting Russia and we'll make it clear that if the the muscle the Russ the missiles are launch from Poland or Romania that we'll hit Poland and Romania because the war can be defined as in the area as wherever the missiles or the F-16 planes are coming from so uh it's going to be much larger uh I'm sort of surprised that Neema had you and me discussing this because we're not the military experts that he usually has on but uh at at least we can uh talk about the political uh setting for all of this and uh the political Dynamics at play yeah and I also think to take it even one step back further the changing global economy which is kept in the background is a major player here in a very ongoing and direct way and and what I mean I won't bore you with the repeating because we've talked about it in earlier conversations but the bricks Alliance is now a bigger richer economic totality if you add up the GD I understand it's a crude measure and all that but if you add up the gdps of the bricks it is now four five percentage points greater as a share of total Global GDP than that of the G7 the United States and its major allies okay this is absolutely phenomena the resource base with which these two alternatives are coming at each other is getting worse and worse if I had to ask a question if you had a military expert here's my question how many of the people making the decisions militarily in the west which means mostly the United States are now of the opinion that time is on the other side and we might as well have a War now because the conditions for any war in the future will be worse for us than they are now so that the provocation that is Alinsky might think of or a Netanyahu might think of is focused on how to provoke that kind of thinking to a greater influence than might otherwise have had because of the horrible place to which it leads well Richard you and I usually have been speaking about the bricks because hardly anybody is doing that and uh we've talked about how it's a new philosophy but uh what's more urgent right now in the milit in the military discussion is what's happening in Europe and Germany if you're going to compare what's growing and what's uh shrinking uh you have you have the coalitions in Europe are falling apart uh just yesterday one of the russophobe at the Brookings institution uh zelson Miller uh pointed out that there they're going to be elections next month in Germany and in East Germany from Saxony uh to the other parts the the two most popular parties are going to be the alternative for deutan the right-wing party and Sarah ven's party now uh to German uh the financial Times article also said that it looks like the Christian democrats are going to be completely wiped out in the sense of not even making the 5% uh limit that uh enables you to have people in Parliament now just imagine this is uh not only is Germany the leading uh aggressor in uh among Europe and Ukraine but it's also uh the home of the leading opposition uh not only to Ukraine but NATO uh on the part of both the afd and uh ven connects uh party and uh so this you're having this pull apart um well in the German press there are all sorts of uh notices that well uh Volkswagen and bmbe are relocating their plants in China uh that they're they know where they've made the decision that that the future uh it's not only you and I that realize this it's the German industry that realized where they have to go they're also trying to make some plants in the United States but they realize that the US protectionism uh is really going to prevent they from doing much of a market here uh you're seeing in France uh the same electoral opposition you're seeing uh uh so much pressure in Europe I think we we've lost Michael Richard can you hear me yes I can hear you should I pick up where Michael left off yeah go ahead Richard all right we okay go ahead well I wanted to pick up by making a point about the French elections because those are behind us where we don't have to guess at what's going on in France we have a very powerful result which has been virtually ignored in the Press here in the United States it's absolutely remarkable they have a new Coalition of the four left-wing parties the major four left-wing parties France unbowed the largest of them led by the Jean luk melanon an anti- capitalist socialist all of his political life together with the french green party the French Socialist Party and the French communist party they're together you know they're the largest Block in the in the parliament of France that's the first time we've seen that in the generation you have to go back to FR many years ago to get anything like that and they are full of people it's not yet their formal position but they're I know a lot of those people they are very critical of the of the French support in of Ukraine and so are the mass of the French people people and they're critical of the support of Israel and so are the mass of the French people and they are not subject to the you know the games that were played in England getting rid of Jeremy Corbin by by a madeup anti-Semitism business wow you know the the change in France is momentous the largest political party is composed of people who refer to themselves as either socialists or left-wing socialists because they want to distinguish themselves from the other kind of socialist they are not you know Scandinavian type socialists they are something else more radical more or less on that and you know and they have a a strong rightwing basically maon is finished he's he's running third in all of this uh as a he's trying to be the king maker because he can't be the king anymore that's over you know it's pathetic and these kinds of people Michael is right you're seeing trembling all over Europe because the center right governments that literally only hit their real stride a year or two or three ago are wondering whether there's going to be the shortest summer they've ever seen as a massive uh movement enraged by what has happened to the European inflation what has happened to their energy prices what has happened to their standard of living what has happened to the global position of Europe look at it it's grateful that it has more than zero rate of growth this year China has 5% the US is two and a half or roughly Europe has nothing Europe you know and yes they're going to China but they're going everywhere wherever they can go where the energy is cheaper and the taxes are no better or no worse for them etc etc you know Europe in many ways Europe is the flasho and if the Europeans have half a brain and they know their own history which they usually do they ought to worry Big Time whether in the end the confrontation between Russia and China on one end and the United States on the other will be resolved by sharing the spoils known as Europe I think that's right that's what this is turning uh turning out to be the interesting thing is that while the voters are doing exactly uh what you've described uh Richard the European Union has just reappointed uh the right-wing pro- Nat uh leadership uh v v liion uh Etc and so the the tension is between the voters of the European Union and the European un Union uh leadership that are completely divorced from the electorate uh as a whole so the question is whether not only Europe will be broken up but either the European Union Constitution will be Rewritten or uh that you're going to have uh Hungary Romania uh Slovakia and other countries simply withdrawing we're seeing a whole breakup here and the interesting thing is that while you and I have been talking for years about how we expect other uh China Russia Iran and the global South uh the global majority to act in its self-interest and begin to move out of the dollar it's the United States policy itself the NATO that is driving them together that is driving Russia and China together that is driving uh uh the bricks together and uh they couldn't have done it without us re just before going on and there is something going on right now we've seen the color revolution in Georgia in Venezuela they were doing they were they wanted to do the same and right now in Bangladesh which is so important when it comes to India and belon Road initiative and which Bangladesh is part of belt and Road initiative and the government the the the government in Bangladesh was Pro India and it seems that right now you look at Africa you look at look at the Europe look at the the the the Asia in each and every region the United States foreign policy is totally in favor of bringing Russia China and India together well there's another feature that the prime minister of Bangladesh explained the reason uh she was forced out was the United States wanted uh the island right off uh of Bangladesh to control the uh is a military Naval Base to control the uh Indian Ocean and uh she refused uh to do that uh and uh that that's what led to her overthrow uh so in these color revolutions that the United States has moving everywhere basically it's if you don't stop us we're going to stop you and these the these revolutions are centered around where does the want the United States want to make military bases to try to do to make other populations fight to the last member they'd like to fight are will they be able to get Georgia to fight to the last Georgian or if not aeran to fight will they get the Armenians to fight for the last Armenians you can look at the United States looking for populations that somehow they can do to them what they did to the Ukraine can they make Japan fight for the last Japanese by letting the Americans put aggressive bases there can they may somehow persuade Taiwan uh to do that that's really what what the choice is it's uh it's really become ex existential for each other country where the United States is trying to create such a revolution I think other countries see now that a color Revolution means we're going to make you into another Ukraine or another Gaza Strip I think I I would add that I'm I don't mean to put a pretty face on what what Michael is saying but I would it looks to me like this is a hopeless strategy I don't think that this can work I think that it is frustrating American policy makers left and right they're not they're not doing it they're not getting the job done it's in the same way I I look at this Trump had his trade war and his tarff war against China my judgment a 100% failed Pro program it was supposed to get regime change if you listen to the really crazy ones around him uh at the very least it's going to slow down China's economic growth it's going to it didn't do any of those things none of them Xi Jinping is as strong as he was then from everything I can tell his commitment and the commitment of their party to what they've been doing is as strong as it's ever been which it should be given what they've accomplished in 25 years how could they not I mean any why would they change their policy it's not only a question of don't change it if it isn't broke it's also a question you went from one of the poorest countries on Earth in a generation to a challenger of the United States why in the world would you change what you're doing I mean this is bizarre and it so it doesn't work and it frustrates them and they escalate and that doesn't work and I think the same is going on in Asia Africa and Latin America the bottom line is those countries used to have to go to London or New York to get their loan to get their trade deal to get their Investments now they have an option and the option which is in New Delhi or Beijing has got more money and each year has Rel ly more money to offer them more help more purchases more loans better deals and this is Relentless and it's becoming self reinforcing as country a discovers it's doing better than country B because it went to China first and Country B realizes whoop we better speed up otherwise the big Chinese railroad will be built over there not over here whereas if we are actually you know geographically a little bit better for and on it becomes a competition it's a little bit like watching the American Industries when the first ones went to China it was considered very risky when they came back with the big profits then everybody had to go then there was a question of oh my God you're gonna get caught not having done what you should have done and I I don't see the ability of the United States to stop it and it on the one hand I'm glad I think the American Empire is over and we ought to face it and get on with it on the other hand I suspect it gives ammunition my word is carefully chosen to the military people because they can again make that claim if we don't do it now if we wait till next year or five years from now this deepening Chasm is going to get worse for us well you and I both have said that the American Empire isn't working but uh what what is uh the a what is the idea of uh the state department and uh Lincoln and Sullivan oh what what do they think is working for them I think all they care about working is are they going will the Democrats be reelected this November and I think they think that uh well it looks now that certainly Harris uh isn't as scile as Biden and that's something but I think they're also think trying to think as long as we can create a narrative they keep talking about what is the narrative and if we we're not we're willing to lose the Empire but we want to win the narrative at least at home and I think that's why they've uh uh taken judge napalitano off YouTube for a week they've uh they've raided the home of uh uh the uh they stopped Kelsey gabri from taking uh uh sub uh the airplanes and they' raided the home I'm I'm blocking out the name uh Scott Ritter uh they're trying to uh stop everybody who's uh talking uh about the kind of thing that you and I are talking about with uh but who has much larger audiences than either of us have and they think if they can control them uh narrative and be uh reelected that's really the only thing that they Define is uh is working maybe they don't care about the Empire maybe they're really so short term so tunnel vision that everything we're talking about loss of the Empire the rise of uh the bricks all that is what they say that's exogenous that's another story that's not where we're about we're just politicians well you know we live live in the country that invented and perfected Modern Advertising I think we are seeing that has a consequence I I've tried to explain in my classes over the years advertising is a very unique form of human communication right we tell our children and we tell students in school to weigh the different aspects of something the good sides the bad sides you know to get a sense of the complexity that is life advertising does not do that advertising tells you the good things real and imagined and it hides the bad things real and imagined that's how it it it is systematically perverted communication because it has an ulterior motive not to assess the strengths and weaknesses of a situation or a person or an event or or a conflict but to get you to do something by twisting and giving you the pluses and hiding the minuses okay we now know that's how we Market our political candidates that's how we set it all and so of course that's what they're going to do with their foreign with their foreign policy look that takes us right back to the beginning having zalinsky able to talk and show pictures of Ukrainian soldiers inside Russia is a wonderful advertising moment on the basis of that you can talk about the mood of Mr Putin I mean and you can make it plausible he might be upset he might have been surprised well now you drop the might because you're an Advertiser it's not that something might make your indigestion go away it will go away oh all right magic you know what's going to happen in the future okay but this is a sign of a system that cannot afford let's remember capitalism cannot afford to leave the purchase of the product to the actual tastes of the buyer that's too risky you have to pound on that buyer make sure that he or she has no options or thinks there's the narrative thinks they have no options so they must buy your product or else they're stupid or else they're backward or they haven't kept up with the famous Joneses or any of the rest of it I think you're watching a state department that is just doing this as it always has this is very old this go if Putin is telling us that that the Ukraine takes us back to World War II and I think he's right about it certainly in terms of NATO expansion and all the rest of it uh then I think it's also fair for me to say yeah and you're living in a society which is geared to these every three to four year election Cycles everything is up for grabs otherwise and in the end I don't mean to be mean I've been you know I've been excited a little bit by kamla Harris as others have in the country but how much difference is it going to make kamla Harris is the choice of Joe Biden he he picked her he picked her because she had shown in all of her previous incarnations that she's not a a Shaker upper and she knows what the difference is because as I think I've told you she has a father and I know her father and I've worked with her father and her father is not her or she him and I'm I'm not commenting on their relationship but he is a Marxist economist and she clearly is not uh and you know but she knows because that's something if your mother is a mar Marxist or your father is a Nazi you it's in there and you too in whatever form it's also in there somewhere you know however much you're against or for that's something else but you know whereof you speak and I think I see her father's influence in her choice of Vice President I thought that was an interesting choice she made not not that it's going to change much but it it's an interesting choice to choose him over the governor of Pennsylvania Mr Shapiro was in which which I I understand was what the choice came down to uh that you know Shapiro is a big Israel supporter Shapiro etc etc and this guy clearly is not and I think that that even before you look at his labor history and stuff like that well what you said uh about advertising uh is really very important because what uh your description of advertising Richard is it it's it's a tunnel vision they want you to look to channel what you're concerned about into uh what they're talking about and that means ignoring the whole context and uh the only political solution certainly what uh you and I have been doing all of our life is to provide the context and uh the job of advertising is just just to prevent it uh to prevent other people well I think that the uh the Brooks countries and other countries outside of the US and NATO have finally decided all of a sudden they're focusing on what is the context for all of this they're uh they're looking at the United States saying yes their concern is just winning the next election uh getting elected their concern is very personal and opportunistic but uh suppose we're we're talking about not only how our countries survive but how our whole region survives and the only way that it can do that is by Mutual Aid uh somehow uh give what president she calls a win-win situation that uh we will we will provide enough incentives for other countries to trade with us to negotiate water rights and uh uh fishing rights and other uh other intern negotiation in a way that uh they will come out in a better position that's not the United States the United States instead of offering a better position and I think we've said this before says uh because of our military bases we can put you in a worse position if you don't do what we say so you this is really almost a difference in Civilization mentalities uh a kind of intolerance uh uh one group of the US NATO trying to hurt other countries if it can't dominate them and if it does dominate them it will hurt them and other countries trying to help each other by resisting uh this attack on themselves to the color revolutions and uh military uh surroundings that we've just been talking about yeah yeah I I want to remind everyone in the context that Mr Trump received quite some notoriety around the world when he was president when he made comments to the effect uh speaking in those days to the Iranians that if they didn't do X Y and Z he would oblit remember that he would obliterate or used words like that implying that the military capability of laying waste to that part of the world is basically Limitless and that the United States would consider using it and I don't think the world has forgotten that we United States Remains the only country so far to use nuclear weapons so it's not a question of might we it's a question of might we again uh do it with and remember the justification it saved lots of American lives over what would have been necessary if we had not used the nuclear we put aside what kind of calculation this is but it's an amazing to say you know we killed huge numbers of people because otherwise we would have killed even more well in case the world has forgotten uh what Trump said just last night uh I want to quote Israel looks tiny on the map compared to other countries in the Middle East is there a way to get more it's so tiny in other words he's urging it to uh just take take the rest of the near East makes it safe for the americ control of oil I mean he's gone really on the offensive and he's uh I mean that may almost uh ensure that he loses the election by frightening people about that he's thrown in uh Down The Gauntlet and the question is whether Harris will have uh enough uh willingness to say what she probably does believe that the uh war against Gaza is wrong but will she instead of saying gee uh won't you please have a SE ceas fire saying wait a minute what is that fire these are American bombs you're dropping and American weapons they using we're uh we're going to declare a cease fire by not giving you any more bombs not giving you any more weapons all she has to say is that now I doubt that she'd uh be willing to say that uh they could always try to replace her at the convention uh but that really is is the whole question uh and since most Americans are uh against uh uh the what's happening in Gaza uh they would probably support them uh and that's probably why uh Trump also said last night I want to quote again when I'm President we will Deport the foreign Jihad surpriser uh sympathizers and hamus supporters if you hate America if you want to eliminate Israel then we don't want you in our country if you're against genocide will the 80% of you leave the country to where no it's an extraord for me it is an extraordinary um an extraordinary spectacle to watch yeah you know the Russians are going to have to deal with Ukraine for for generations to come the scars of all of this in the Ukraine are going to run deep and I I don't know how ukrainians how they will make sense of what just happened to them when this is over but I'm fearful of where that kind of suffering that they're in store for I suspect the West will not give them anywhere near the amounts of money that that are being talked about in terms of uh rebuilding uh the country if the Russians help they'll rebuild the dbas area where they are concerned why would they do otherwise uh the West is going to have other priorities there's going to be all kinds of delay I can just see it and and Israel the same thing what what are you going to do with the surrounding populations and especially if they now expand the war to the West Bank and Hezbollah gets involved I mean I really do you want to Beque to your children the Decades of trouble and rage and bitterness that are going to explode one evening by the bus stop or the next week uh over in the hills and my God the short-sided mentality here is devastatingly self-destructive well the only part explanation I think is that the United States says yes it's self-destructive for the ukrainians but uh as you just said Richard it's going to take Russia a lot of resources to rebuild uh the civilian structure that the ukrainians have attack Russia's avoided hitting the civilian structure in Ukraine but the ukrainians have not focused on the economic or commercial structure hitting they focused on the civilian structure and that's exactly what Russia uh is pledged to do uh to rebuild not only the donbas but uh it'll be the the whole uh northern and western Circle uh to down to Essa uh in Russia and the to the US thinking well we will even if uh Ukraine loses War Russia takes over will win because Russia will now have to rebuild Ukraine and then in the American view it will have fewer resources uh to support China in next year's war against China once China hits the bricks that's the only logic that I can think of in their mind you know but every time someone makes that logical point I I have a good time I I point to them listen the United States went through the worst depression of its history in the 1930s you know what got them out of the depression fighting an extremely expensive War that's what got him out why is Russia have a better GDP growth in the last two years this is same I mean they didn't have a terrible depression before granted but they weren't doing as well the the the fiscal stimulus that this war has given them has solved the whole book raft of problems for It Was Naive for the Americans to think of this as a oh you use a it's like a it's like the mistake an introductory student makes yes you lose resources you piss them away but then you explain to the student we have a military it shoots things in the outer space that have no use at all and we are creating you know millions of jobs to make this that we throw into the world into the into space a war is like that and then the students slowly get oh yeah right and they begin to understand the Russians understood the Russians yes there're they're they're wasting resources on Military no question but they were also stimulating all the rest of their economy and that stimulus has been a net plus for them literally from the beginning from February of of 2022 right to the the present they're they're growing faster than the United States as I speak to you that's the truth that's the reality and the the result uh that in immaterial forms is the whole world now has seen that there United States is willing to turn uh countries into Ukraine or Gaza that don't follow the US order so this is a sort of an immaterial Impulse for them to uh put the concerns that you and I have been talking about uh over everything else yeah I I and I think you know if we had more of our media attention and maybe Nema this is something you can deal with but there are these so-called minor events which if you put them in the correct context turn out not to be so minor so in this little landlock country of ner in in Africa something remarkable is going on there uh that has to do with the United States military and the Russian military right and what is that about and the turmoil on the other side of Africa in Kenya that's also uh Kenya has been a place where East and West have connived and mingled in their politics way back from the time of the Mau in the 1950s on on to the present some of these events deserve and they might be a lot better than Michael and me and people who really study and know that but a lot of these events need to be taken out of the narrative Michael is right that they're stuck in in our press and brought into you know into a different one it's just as just as important in its way as as letting people know what is going on in French politics or German po even in Britain the total I mean really historic rejection of the conservatives I mean they had 15 million votes they lost 10 million of them I mean just unbelievable numbers of people who have been voting conservative for Generations who couldn't bring themselves anymore you know what is that about beyond the immediate immediacy of sunak or starmer or the others there is there's something extraordinary je Jean Luke melona in France has lots of detractors he's an older guy he's a tough working class kind of guy he comes across that way and a lot of French people love it but a lot of French people are offended by it they still voted for him what is that about what are they articulating when they do that well if we're seeing the end of colonialism as we're seeing in Africa we're also seeing the end of the American uh Financial colonialism and financial domination and the uh the dollar standard and the whole uh web of inter foreign investment uh and foreign investment rules that have been uh preventing these countries from developing all along so all of these blockages to development are all being pulled up right now and the whole world is able to go forward and all the United States can do uh is destructive in in in character all of that is accelerating we're really seeing a whole different direction the world is going in as a result of what's happened in the last uh since February 2022 just to wrap up this session Richard and Michael there is a new article in German publication built it say says that German tanks on Russian soil again they're talking about kers region they're using German tanks on Russian soil the question is if I were to mention the second country that is damaging that is hurting from this conflict in Ukraine would be Germany because all that problems all those problems with Nordin Pipeline and all energy coming from Russia why they're thinking in this way is there anything good coming out of this conflict for Germany in your opinion not that I'm aware of and I I really do look and I think I think Michael is more right than he perhaps knows right under the surface in German culture right now is an enormous hostility to what they feel has been a disas ous policy of their government they don't I mean they just they don't care about the Ukraine and they really don't care much about the Middle East either but they do care everything about what is called in German Vira vunda the miracle of the the economic miracle that they recovered from World War II to become the leading economic engine of Europe and then with the unification the biggest as well as most powerful engine and all of that which carried up their standard of living which gave them the sense that the rise of Germany interrupted by World War I and never recovered since could now be recovered without war and suddenly in ways that had nothing to do with them it's all taken away it's all taken away the United States insists and the political forces inside Germany cannot mobilize against the United States and therefore they decide to go with the United States and destroy the foundations of their own economic well-being it's an EXT and when Michael says you know VW or BMW or what moving to China and the few that are coming United States and they're going all over they're going because there's no future for them here not only are they suffering but their own politicians don't offer them any reason to stay so what said Richard and I agree I don't see a future for them you've described why they're angry they're described why they want to throw out the government but I don't see them moving toward a future they're not I don't see another uh V Thunder on Insight no I don't either and I don't even see a political leader anywhere with in a position to be uh a focal point that might articulate at this point I see lots of bitterness I see the Old Guard trying to hold on you know wonderlight and the the the Danish guy Yen whatever his name is horrible I mean people with a politics that it just make you cringe because it's nothing it's it's limping along doing what you imagine the Americans want while the Americans are insulting you because they don't have the respect for you you offer them nothing really anymore so it is a kind of sad depiction they know it but they can't figure out how to deal with it and so we watch them do nothing it's a very strange very strange period of time yes and that's all Europe they've been star marized yes that's right I'm hopeful that the French will show us something interesting they have the people now they certainly have the leadership they have the brains they could and they have the organization I know from my own French family how political IC parties are organized in France household by household week by week you're visited by the representative of the party in your neighborhood who checks in on you who picks up the dues who makes sure your kid gets into the school and and then when the call comes on a Saturday afternoon we need 20,000 people at the train station to have a demonstration oh you can't make make it this week okay we'll make a note but the next time we call you will have to have four members of your household come to the rally and and they do they go because they want that connection they want the help they want the the backup they want the this they want that and it works it's been working for a long time and you can't you can shake it you can even get people who are in one to vote another way it's a secret ballot they can do it but even those who will vote against you will come back and participate again in the same old party because that's their that's their context that's their link that's their Network it's very very very different from the United States very different so we ended up on a positive note yes thank you so much Richard and Michael great pleasure as always same here good to talk to both of you you pressed the record button I didn't see a note for this see you soon we we we we were live we are live right now
