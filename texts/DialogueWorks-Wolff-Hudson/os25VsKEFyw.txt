hi everybody today is Thursday January 30th 2025 and our friend Richard Wolff and Michael Hudson are back with us welcome back glad to be here let's get started Richard with your article about the situation in the Middle East and the way that you're describing the Israel's dead end in that AR what is your understanding and what are you trying to say in that article okay yeah the purpose of that article was to draw a connection that I think will help people understand uh the Israel Gaza Horrors that we are living through um and I don't just mean Gaz of the West Bank the whole story there of of that conflict and what I link it to in this article is an experience of another settler colonialism an attempt by a minority to take over a majority of people that are ethnically or religiously or otherwise distinct from them to and to see whether I can draw draw some lessons and to do that I made use of uh a book I published many years ago uh which grew out of my doctoral dissertation that had to do with the colonialism practiced in the east African country of Kenya by the British uh my book covers the establishment of the British colony in that part of the world Britain had several colonies in Africa as I think most people know and several in the eastern part of Africa which is where Kenya is located long story short what the British did there was to arrive and to make a determination all by themselves that they were going to establish a colony based on settling British citizens in the highlands in the middle the geographic middle of Kenya the highlands have a very fertile soil they have a very good climate it was a logical place um for them to do this and they made the effort to determine uh what would be good to grow there and to what would be good to produce and again long story short they determined that would be coffee which to this day is an important export of Kenya around the world and they produce particularly arabica coffee which is the highest quality among coffees and theirs is even better than most in order to do this they expelled they pushed away the Africans that had lived for centuries on this land they put them in they forced them out I mean Force physical military force and forced them into reservations portions of land much inferior to the land they were forced out of and very quickly it was clear what the logic here was the Reser reserved areas and and the major group that suffered this was a tribal grouping for those that might be interested known as the kikuyu tribe in that part of Africa they could not survive on these reserved areas there wasn't enough land it wasn't a good enough quality they weren't used to this kind of farming this was an impossible way for them to survive but of course the British had the solution which is okay you live on the reservation and then every day you go to the coffee plantation and you work and the coffee plant ERS the British settlers paid your wages which enabled you to get by the government then came in the British government and taxed the wages so it took back part of the money that the settlers pay you have to laugh because the alternative would you you'd have to cry because what it meant was that the these abused expelled Africans had to work for next to nothing to grow the coffee and then got taxed on their next to nothing so that the colonial government wouldn't have to tax the settlers let alone the British people back home so it was a desperate Desire by the way all of this is explicit I spent time in the British colonial office in London I spent time in the British museum in London looking at all the records and they and they all discussed it and they debated the British knew exactly what they were doing anyone who wants to excuse this nonsense by thinking that the British and they love this phrase in England muddled through is nuts they didn't muddle it all they worked all this out and uh that's why Kenya functioned as a commodity excuse me as a colony but eventually and here's my point this was an untenable Arrangement because it was an immense exploitation of about 3 to4 million Africans by a handful a few thousand European settlers and It produced tension and conflict and bitterness the the formal colony was established in 1895 and and almost ons schedule 50 years later around 19 in the early 50s it blew up and suddenly the African population was no longer having individual efforts to change the situation or even small group efforts it had a fullscale organized rebellion and it was known as the Mau Rebellion was led by a very charismatic African leader named Jomo Kenyata uh and the British moved in to violently suppress the Mau Rebellion it was characterized in the most lurd terms you could imagine in the European press which had it all set up as the rise of the Savages who had to be put down by the benevolent British with their commitment to peace so this war to make peace ended up with a with the victory of the British they defeated the Mau they captured and imprisoned Joo Kenyatta it was one of those great ironies it proved to the British that their situation was hopeless because whatever they did what this Mau Rebellion had showed them was that the illusion that they could survive in a settler colonialism was an illusion because in the ma Mau put down it's true only 33 uh uh settlers I don't remember the exact number a trivial number of settlers were killed a very small number of European military were killed and about 12 or 15,000 uh Africans were killed so you have numbers that should remind you of Israel and the the Palestinians but the British had to face they really had no choice that what the Mau had showed them is they would have to spend a Fortune of money preparing for the next ma Mau which could happen at any time the ma the first Mau they defeated but they had learned how to fight to to repress the Mau took the British seven years an enormous expenditure of money and this was remember at a time when the rest of the British Empire and particularly the the center of it namely India had been lost to them and they basically made the decision they can't do this anymore because the prospect was for Endless conflict costing endless amounts of money disrupting whatever that Colony might hope to it was a decision that you might say let's cut our losses from what this is and so even though they won the war they ended up saying okay we're leaving they released Mr Kenyata from jail and he became the first president of an indep dependent Kenya and they've LED their own life as a nation since that time to this moment that I'm speaking and I hope I've given you in a flavor the transition to Israel should be fairly obvious right it's a settler colonialism you plunk a group of mostly Europeans in the middle of a non-european community that's quite a bit larger there's a bit of a difference that the Israeli percentage has grown and the Palestinian has shrunk but it's still the case the rest of it fits pretty well and again I would argue that what happened in October of 2023 was the rough equivalent of the Mau Uprising and you've now spent a fortune of money dealt a blow to the Israeli economy from which it will take years to recover uh yet you have the Absurd imbalance between how many Israelis died and how many Palestinians died but that is really like the African and it doesn't change that what Israel is looking at now having seen what Hamas could do having now seen that Hamas could actually survive this Onslaught that they Unleashed on them well like the British they are looking at an open ended when will this ever stop and they have enough problems as a society adding this and so I'm hoping that writing it up this way and drawing the parallels and making the equivalences might shed light on how to look at the Israeli phenomena and to see the dead end toward which it is moving and maybe come to some rational solution beforehand rather than and and this is directed as much at the Israelis in hopes they see it as it is to the Palestinians because it does Shore up the Palestinian notion that in the end they will win yeah Michael do you want to add something well Richard has uh indeed written a wonderful article on the whole uh certainly on British and European uh colonialism uh France did exactly the same thing uh in in Tunisia uh his article's been uh widely reprinted I read it uh on naked capitalism today and there's been a long discussion about uh uh what makes uh Israel somewhat different from the uh from the m in Kenya and uh one of the differences is of course uh private sector uh Zionist financing uh Richard makes the point that Britain decided that uh the cost of imposing uh the military Empire on uh Kenya just uh wasn't worth the price it was easier to give it its independence and then exploit it the oldfashioned way uh Zionism has uh is supported not only by the US government but by an enormous uh group of wealthy Zionist financiers of of Israel uh and one of the effects of this has been that Zionism has transformed American politics in a way that uh Kenya never transformed British politics uh the Zionism through APAC was a major factor in uh leading the supporters of citizens united to claim that uh it's okay to privatize American politics by letting private money uh be uh directly financing the campaigns of congressmen uh and Senators uh the the Momo had no fifth column in Britain uh to do this not to mention the support from the Bible and the Christian fundamentalism uh but there's also I think a different uh something that goes beyond what the British did uh in Kenya US foreign policy wants to use subtler colonialism for the broader purpose of controlling the Middle East oil uh and asserting political control over the Arab population uh when Britain wanted to defeat the Momo it wanted to defeat it as a military force and a political force but not to kill uh the native populations because that would have uh uh deprived them of of the workers that Britain wanted to work on the coffee plantations and other Employments uh but the US doesn't have much use for the Arab population uh in the near East all it wants is the oil uh and oil doesn't require as much labor as cultivating coffee plantations uh I don't believe that there can be a two-state uh solution uh in Israel as alist Crook and people and I've discussed on on this show is OB it looks like an either or a decision one group or another has to win and uh the what makes this all the more urgent for Israel is that uh as you pointed out at the beginning there were many more natives in in Kenya than there were British settlers but in Israel you have even today almost a 5050 population split between the Palestinians in the Israelis so the question is what's going to happen uh and uh what are we to make of I think over the last few days president Trump has said he wants to withdraw all of the troops American troops uh from Syria and it looks to me like he and the US policy uh heads seem to have decided to let jalani alaria use Isis to support control of the Arab states and their oil uh instead of relying on Israel to do this because Israel just doesn't have the Manpower that it's willing to sacrifice to fight uh other Arabs where is jalani and the Isis people are willing to die for their Jihad against uh enemies that are not wahhabi uh Sunni that makes a big difference that and that willing to die that terrorism of Isis that America has founded F and funded and put in place is uh even much more brutal than the the Israeli terrorism against the Arabs so Israel lacks the resources and the troops to die to promote the US control of the oil whereas the uh the the Sunni and galani are willing to do so the other great question is whether that you leave sort of open at the end whether how long Israel can actually survive is an economy one of the results in the last year's fighting has been that a lot of uh leading Israeli industry has left the country along with the skilled labor force that have left the country a lot of gone to the United States or other places the question is whether uh th this trauma of of the fight uh in Gaza is is going to have a similar effect to the trauma of kenyatta's fight against uh against England I guess we're going to see the result of that in the next year or two could you spell out just a little bit more Michael um how you see this possible withdrawal of American troops from what's left of Syria how that is going to play out and how and how and how Mr Trump is going to work that out with Mr Netanyahu given that if I understood you he might be in the process of sacrificing Netanyahu to move American patronage over to the to the folks that have taken over in Syria well he's going to try to do it without sacrificing Netanyahu but I think he's he's already stopped uh sending uh the bombs there he's taken the Patriot missiles that were in Israel and he's sent them all to Ukraine uh to try to uh use against Russia apparently uh it what surprises me is that withdrawing from Syria means what were the US troops doing there they were stealing Syria's oil mostly for Israel uh are Israeli troops going to come in and take control of the oil to send the oil to Israel that hasn't been discussed and I have been even heard rumors about that that's one one of the open questions almost everything is an open question uh I I think you're right uh Trump seems to be withdrawing uh from Israel is part of his withdrawing from the near race and withdrawing from Ukraine and withdrawing from the whole NATO uh military neocon establishment he's he's fired the neocons and has made no hostility of his opposition to the old neocons even though he seems to be appointing new neocons uh there I can't figure out what the game is certainly he's constrained uh and J Isis and gilani have been working so closely with Israel all along Israel is basically been acting as the intermediary between the United States and Isis and uh Syria so they make uh they certainly seem to have come to a modus vandi there but now you have turkey uh playing a role as an intercession with uh eron's hopes and fantasies about reestablishing the old Ottoman Empire that's the wild card in all this so you have the US uh attempt to control near Eastern Oil through uh the Arabs along uh with uh the Israelis and then you have turkey does it want the oil what it's going to do how long can this very delicate three-way uh triangulation occur I I don't think there's any way of foreseeing that right now everything is uh prone to surprises well I would add one again that's your helpful but let me add another wrinkle because the article did what I thought it could do it you know didn't cover everything no article ever can but there is this problem of the of the declining American Empire I'm beginning more and more to get the impression that historically what Mr Trump will be remembered for or his regime is Simply Having made the transition from a complete denial that the Empire is in trouble let alone declining to an accommodation it is declining and we have to face it and we have to withdraw because we can't afford it it is like the British in a peculiar way because it is costing the United States the alliance with Israel uh and being held by most of the world to be complicit in a genocide against Muslim people this can't be a good projection of soft power whatever those words mean this is the opposite of all of that it it is Pro ejecting and the rest of the world sees it I mean everyone watches the growth of bricks and the decline the G7 was the alternative to Bricks but the the central player in the G7 the United States is now busily threatening the economic survival of Canada and Mexico Canada is part of the G7 and Mexico used to be an ally of the G7 basically so everything's falling apart and you have the sense Mr Trump sees that in some way or the people who fund him see it and and it's time for a re-calibration when Michael said before about my article that yeah the British withdrew from colonialism and then said about coming up with a different non colonialist way of exploiting the Africans of Kenya that's exactly right and the United States is now trying to figure out how it can revive its Global dominance but without the kind of Empire they presided over before because they can't afford that anymore they have to make a and I can imagine someone in in in erdogan's position noticing the emerging vacuum and wanting to be at least part of what fills it the Europeans aren't going to fil fill it they're on a death trip they're out of the story they can't do hardly anything this is a game in which the Chinese in one way and whatever the West can rescue if it can on the other side and it's a reorganization of the world economy provoked by the inability of the United States to to deal with all of the reaction against it that it has produced over the last 75 years and that's that's very similar to the situation of what the British Empire provoked in the last 75 years which is the first part of the you know the first half or more of the 20th century they they destroyed themselves they produced the Mahatma Gandhi and the end of their empire there and the United States has produced it there it's a little murky and I think Michael agrees exactly how this is going to play out in terms of the US Israel connection what happens to it but it is now caught up in these larger forces it is not going to shape what happens it is going to have to suffer what happens well as you pointed out uh the at least Britain France and the United States had an alternative to outright military colonialism occupation and that's Financial colonialism economic colonialism trade colonialism is a means of control uh but the United States has lost that as we've been discussing on the last few shows with Nima the United States doesn't have much to offer the rest of the world uh except control relinquishing control of its oil uh maybe agriculture but the real one thing that the United States has to offer the rest of the world uh that other countries don't have what makes the United States the exceptional country is it can offer not to bomb other countries it can offer not to destroy their economy to sanction them uh and to militarily destroy them all it can do is say uh we won't hurt you and overthrow you with regime change if you do what we want that's not a winning policy that that is the last uh straw the the last recourse of uh an Empire uh that's falling and uh I mean to me I what what you and I are watching here is the fight within the US government right now uh you've described uh what Trump's plan is but uh you're you're seeing the fight yesterday the day before the front pages and long whole page articles from The New York Times And The Wall Street Journal have been what to do to prevent telsey gabard from becoming Trump's National Security advisor and all sorts of personal attacks uh ad hominum attacks uh everything that the Democrats uh and the neocom uh can dig up against tulsey Gard have been uh pushed before the the public and you can be sure that when the hearings on her begin in a day or two for will she become the National Security uh uh advisor saying what the entire Congress the entire CIA denies uh she says that Russia is winning the war in Ukraine and uh so she's accused of being a Russian puppet for saying that she's accused of having actually gone to Russia and talked to to Putin to see if you're a national security adviser you're supposed to know what the other parties think she actually looks at what they thought that is unpatriotic if you talk to Putin he is so hypnotically overpowering that you immediately become his puppet they say not only that she went to Syria and talked to Assad to try to own a fact-f finding mission to see what's happening there that makes her Assad's puppet they act as if uh any acknowledgment that foreigners have an independent policy to react to American policy is unpatriotic because the basic assumption underlying All American foreign policy models and uh planning is that foreign forign countries will have no response to any action that the United States does they will simply be passive there will be no blowback no counter reaction that's why American Military economic financial and other policy has failed has failed it's it is a kind of hubris in believing that other countries have uh no alternative and of course they do but the fact that Tuli Gab and other appointees that Trump wants to make are realistic uh is an attack on the unrealistic fantasies that have dominated uh the neocons in the United States and which dominate the uh the Senate uh that's still being bought out by uh neocon uh Israeli and other uh other interests uh so we're seeing the fight in the United States just as bitter as uh the International uh conflict between the United States and uh the bricks and the rest of the world yeah yeah let's remember let's remember that uh most of the rest of the world I last week I read a a reprint or a readout of a of a speech given by this the intelligence Chief inside Ukraine which reached the clusion that the Ukrainian Army was 6 months away from a a complete collapse in other words if the if the war con continues for another six months so we're talking this coming summer of the Year 2025 then we won't be talking anymore about the war because it'll be over the Russians will I don't know how this works and nobody does but will be effectively the only military force unless all of NATO goes to war against Russia then then it's open again how that plays out and you know if the if the head of intelligence of your own country tells you it's over in six months and what is every weapon as far as I understand every weapon that the West could have used in Ukraine it has now used it has given to Mr zalinski and he has made use of it and it's clearly not adequate to prevent the Russians from continuing the war forcing the Ukrainian intelligence Chief if he isn't a complete fraud to say as the intelligence Chief let me tell you what an intelligent view looks at the irony of this is that every major European an government was effectively drawn in based on the history of NATO to endorse and support and pay money towards the American calculation that this was a great place to confront Russia you could provoke Russia Russia made the decision put aside whether it was a right or wrong one but they made the decision to invade uh Ukraine to stop a process which had already gotten quite far along namely NATO moving East and they calculated that this was a this was a safe bet this is now one of the greatest miscalculations ever I mean this is really you blew it you didn't understand the Russian military strength you didn't understand the support the rest of the would give to Russia in order to strengthen it to fight like this blah blah and so all of them have to pursue this war they have to have this crazed mentality that Michael just outlined they can't see any of this because it would be to confront their own the ends of their career they're going to go down with the defeat in Ukraine that's their fear that's why they make make statements like it's Unthinkable that Russia would win the whole world finds it perfectly straightforward to think that they can't think that they really are entered a war where they cannot think about losing it that is a very dangerous way to make a war very very danger you are gonna miss opportunities you are gonna pile mistakes on one another you have to understand that you might lose and take the steps otherwise that loss will be cataclysmic because you didn't calculate how to deal with when it goes badly and you can see that that's why they had to give them one weapon uh one weapon system that they had promised never to give them after another they weren't in control anymore they desperate they are desperate and this this tulsey gabard if she is the symbol of that desperation coming back to really haunt them then let's be clear this this might be and even Mr Trump may not see this yet but if you can Prevail and make it clear that the war in Ukraine was was lost you're giving Mr Trump the opportunity to do to his political enemies what they had done to him you demonize them they are they are a disaster when China when the Communist in China won in 1949 it provoked here in the United States a horrible Red Scare which was already underway anyway with McCarthy but politician after politician State Department official after were hauled before committees in the full glare of and the the question asked was you're responsible for our losing China so once again the other is rendered with no agency so these bad people did that well Mr Trump is full of people who will remember and may discover that they have more to gain by demonizing anyone that can connect to the Ukraine war than any other way of defeating their political enemies and we will we will then be you know shown a government that will force us to be witnesses to an endless political drama of witch hunting the bad people who lost Ukraine well you've made two important points the first one uh when you talk who is the they in Europe who cannot uh conceive that somehow NATO might lose that they are the politicians who look like they're being voted right out of power uh in Germany uh France uh Italy uh Slovakia uh Hungary uh and and other places so uh you you're seeing a a split that makes you wonder how long can NATO survive and ultimately how long can the European Union survive as an arm of NATO uh and your second point is uh uh sets the stage for the argument that we're going to be seeing for the next uh year or two who lost Russia uh I think that Trump sees that this is going to be uh the great argument and he doesn't want to be blamed for losing Russia he wants to uh make it very clear that he came in as a peace candidate uh not as a candidate who is still trying to live the Biden neocon blink Zionist fantasy that somehow uh NATO uh could win and defeat Russia on its own own borders so uh I think he's already saying uh he wants peace because not only can it can't be win but he's trying to reduce the American budget deficit so that uh his fantasy of balancing the budget the neocon F the neoliberal fantasy uh can be uh met so he's dissociated himself from the uh being blamed for the loss of NATO and trying to make it clear that the thought of attacking uh of backing Ukraine against Russia from the beginning was never really to win it was simply to hope that uh Ukraine would drain Russian uh military drained the Russian economy leading to an economic collapse and regime change which is of course uh uh fantasy well you still had in the last few days uh you had the the crazy Estonian uh NATO EU lady saying that uh we we've got to continue the objective of NATO is to break Russia into a number of smaller countries uh if NATO is to win we cannot have strong countries we have to broke break them up this is the crazy fantasy that uh certainly the EU leadership and the current politicians in the EU leadership and the NATO leadership are in power uh I think that Trump realizes that where this is leading is where you and I have forecast all along that NATO's pretty much over uh and in fact uh the US Reliance of Europe on uh Europe to act uh on its behalf with American Support is over and America has no intention at all of financing the uh NATO fantasy that somehow it can drain Russia that's why Putin says you Europeans have to raise your defense spending to 5% of GDP from your less than 2% of GDP that it is now in other words we're not going to pay anymore we're not going to give uh our arms and money to Ukraine you can do it if it's your fantasy but this fantasy uh that the Biden Administration and the neocons have promoted is your fantasy not mine uh and it's still the fantasy of course of the neocons but uh this is we're seeing a breakup of the narrative that has been behind this fantasy yeah and I I wouldn't I wouldn't short Change again the declining Empire the Empire funded Europe in a fundamental way we had military keynesianism here we had government spending crazily for a military that was crazy right those statistics that we spend more on Military than the next nine countries in the world combined even though most of those nine are allies of the United States we we had this deal we will we will provide the military umbrella you don't have to in Europe do that we will do it knowing of course that it's American money going into the American military industrial uh complex that's most of what we're talking about so it's a stimulant for American capitalism gives it a floor below which it can't fall because of government spending and it gives us reliable allies a buffer against the Soviet Union all those years but at this point when we're running trillion doll deficits every year it's becoming a problem and you have to draw I mean you have to you can hope that you can exploit in yet other ways like the British did but they knew they had to give up the control and they had fought for that control all over the world they had to give it up and they could tell themselves there are other ways to exploit and there were and they did them but I want to remind everyone also that the decline of Britain never stopped it's weaker now than it has been in a century the government of Mr starmer you know doesn't know which way to turn it's a horrible joke the conservatives handed the the labor this government at a time when the worst possible time to be the government because it looks so bad what it is you can't do so I think that in in here in the United States there is a Michael is right there's a terrible struggle going on and it's not clear between Republicans and Democrats I'm sure that struggle is going on inside both of those parties with their respective Wings because they've reached a point where the the decline has to be faced you can pretend it isn't there but you have to face the practical consequences what the what the Middle East looks like if the United States were to try to go in and replace the Lost Syrian government in order to be yeah it would be in better control if all of Syria was an American base then you could have Syria and Israel and they could together do but those things are not available anymore they can't do it or to say the same thing another way without blowing the budget literally out they can't do this thing you know and so they are now forced and Mr Trump is doing a good job he covers it all over as if it were making America great again which it isn't and if it's putting America first again which it isn't you know the the people before him did that more than he's going to be able to do it but he's bigger promoting it with advertising than they were they didn't think they needed it he grasps that they do well I think you're right and if reality raises its ugly head in the way that you've described then uh uh Trump's uh plan and I think he'll be able to convince the Democrats to go along with it is that NATO's Europe's problem it's no longer America's problem uh if NATO wants to fight Russia let it and of course NATO doesn't have the ability to fight Russia uh because it costs too much and if it cost America too much imagine how much already uh it's cost Europe in the form of de-industrializing Germany's economy uh all of Europe will have to impose austerity uh to fight a war that it can't possibly uh uh win and it will also lose the Social Democrat Party the labor parties uh all of the left-wing parties that are really the ultra right-wing War part ities uh that'll be overthrown by the Nationalist parties right-wing as they are I think it's a tragedy that Europe doesn't have any real uh left-wing uh anti-war parties except for Sarah's uh party in Germany uh but things do not look good uh for Europe in either way if Europe can avoid the the war in Ukraine and the military uh expense of taking over NATO from the United States but it will be at the hands of right-wing anti-labor parties that are going to uh be pretty pretty brutal and awful yeah and also just to expand on one point Europe in many of its countries provides a remarkably generous at least by comparison to other countries a social welfare system of of free educ ation and health care and all of the rest of it that we know quite well and the only way to pursue this war would be either to run the risk of a crazed inflation which they don't want to do or the austerity to take the money away from social welfare in order to fight a war they have now for three years lost this is a recipe as Michael correctly says for being being politically destroyed your your working class will go over to the right wi if the rightwing says we won't do this and the rightwing is able to do that now partly because it doesn't have a a serious left threat that could emerge but they don't have it now otherwise you continue to have what you have now which is a kind of mixture between a right wing which says no more of this war and the left wing which say no more of this that that's it that's the overwhelming majority of the of the mass and how long these people can keep up a a costly War when the leftwing and the rightwing have deserted them I mean I wouldn't bet on them they wouldn't bet on themselves under those circumstances so it looks like the class war is back in business yes yes it always was it just was covered over by advertisers telling you that it wasn't and it wasn't there and and all the rest of it I I was struck I was struck the other day when a western commentator wrote or he he spoke and he had this wonderful idea uh based on a question posed by an interlocutor he said you know your question is really interesting but the only way I know how to answer it is to say say there is this thing which we don't talk about much he said it's called the Surplus and you can think about an economy as though some people produce a surplus that flows to other people and if you think like that here's some interesting you he was teaching and by the way this is no leftist no Marxist no nothing he was teaching the journalist that there was this other thing that it might be worth thinking about it was a Charming moment it was a Charming moment what it's all about yes yes yeah just before wrapping up this session here is what Donald Trump said about his policy toward Taiwan future we're going to be placing tariffs on forign production of computer chips semiconductors and Pharmaceutical to return production of these essential Goods to the United States of America they left us and they went to Taiwan where which is about 98% of the chip business by the way and we want them to come back and we don't want to give them billions of dollars like this ridiculous program that Biden has give everybody billions of dollars they already have billions of dollars they've got nothing but money Joe they didn't need money they needed an incentive and the incentive is going to be they're not going to want to pay a 2550 or even 100% tax they're going to build their Factory with their own money we don't have to give them money they're going to come in because it's good for them to come in they giving them money they don't even know what they're going to do with it I had people tell me we have no idea we didn't need money they don't know if they're even they're probably going to use the money to build another places other countries it's a ridiculous plan very expensive and ridiculous the only way you'll get out of this is to build your plant if you want to stop paying the taxes or the tariffs you have to build your plant right here in America that's what's going to happen at record levels we're going to have more plants built in the next short period of time than anybody ever envisioned before because the incentive is going to be there because they have no tariff whatsoever in fact they have help from us if they build their plant in America Chinese government pays a tar no they don't yes they do I want to say I'm an importer and exporter for 20 years okay when a product comes into the US there's something called a tariff sheet okay I as the buyer of that product follow us law and pay the Tariff I'm an American citizen American taxpayer I pay that tariff to the US government and that increase in the cost I then sell to you for a higher price cuz I've got to cover that tariff what about there you say our tariffs are higher when they go overseas as opposed to theirs coming here tariffs are never zero some game tariffs are a tool for example you might say you want to sell us your beans we are going to give you a low tariff if you buy our corn but the cost of the Tariff is ultimately always born by the consumer don't you think at the end of the day they might have there maybe more competition within the market of the US government you're confusing the question this is not a question of competition the point we're discussing is who Bears the cost of the Tariff I couldn't tell you if it's good policy for the US government to tax beans and for the Chinese government to tariff corn but what I can absolutely assure you is that a product that comes into the US is paid for by a us company and the increased cost of that is is born by all of us I am an importer and exporter I do it for a living okay then what's the alternative if at one point in our country's history was tffs that paid for our economy tariffs don't pay for your economy but they did we didn't have income tax that was before we had Municipal infrastructure corre yeah here is the let me be naive enough to uh let its computer chip uh industry be hostages in the sense that uh China's Tick Tock has been a hostage uh the if if if Taiwan says all right we're not going to employ Taiwanese and uh make money here we're going to build it in America to employ Americans instead of Taiwanese that Taiwan already has said that the Americans are not willing to work as hard as the Taiwanese and don't have the training but uh just imagine that uh if at some point Taiwan should say well we've decided uh not to fight China we've decided that our future lies uh to re reintegration with China in a Hong Kong like our relationship we want to invest in China not the United States the United States will then confiscate the U the computer chip factories that Taiwan have made here or it will say just like we made China sell Tik Tock for pennies on the dollar or will close you down you know you can sell your billions and of dollars of investment here for pennies on the dollar to the United States because you're not our friend anymore because you're friendly with China and uh it's uh you're with us or you're against us is Taiwan going to be so silly as to go along with Trump's thre threats yeah I'm always amazed at this ability not to understand what the options are you know if if Taiwan comes here and does what is being what Mr Trump wants it to do it is going forget what the Taiwanese company or for that matter the Taiwanese government the whole rest of the world will look upon this Enterprise in a completely different way first of all they're if they if the government can control the Taiwanese company that way they know that dealing with the Taiwanese government always puts you in a dependent relationship to the United States government which has shown you what it is prepared to do so the only safe thing to do is to minimize your relationship with the Taiwanese chip producer produce one yourself get the Chinese who are showing us that they can do almost all of this stuff as well or better than the West anyway so you will diversify 50 times faster Mr Trump seems to think he can do these things and there's no for P out there's no consequence there's nothing that could happen to to undo the objective that drove this this is a very bizarre way of thinking it didn't even apply in the Heyday of the American Empire you couldn't think this way in the 1970s and 80s without making terrible mistake but to do it now are you crazy especially if the Taiwanese company has to come here and pay American salaries and what those those chips will not be able to be carried by a truck the inputs nor carried out of the factories with trucks the output because the Americans can't buy Chinese electric trucks we have a 100% tariff on them which means the costs of the trucks that are going into it will be radically different here with 100% tariff then they would be over the the Everything Changes one for me it just just in terms of how you think about things you want to shake Mr Trump and the people around him metaphorically obviously you want to shake them how do you how do you reason like that we're going to this and then they're going to do that really you think the world works you decide to do something and you can tell me clearly and 100% what the outcome is has he never understood the concept of unintended circumstances has he never understood that when you capture a model a notion of a causes B that that's never the truth because there's always loads of other things going on that impact your B and it's not reducible to an effect of a I mean you're supposed to learn this in the third grade basically and we're seeing people in very high Office unable to think it through every president of the last dozen has made the statement I am going to bring manufacturing back to the United States 12 presidents out of 12 none of them ever succeeded not the Republicans not the Democrat are it because these people are all stupid hardly a they're not stupid and B they were articulating a goal they need to articulate they lack the means to achieve it and Mr Trump lacks them also because they're not all in his control this is crazy he misunderstands blaming your political opponent which is a game they all play now he has to discover that the reason his predecessor couldn't do these things is often because they weren't achievable he didn't have the means not that he's a stupid person or inadequately patriotic come on this is sort of silly but it passes now for great for great wisdom well what the American narrative lacks is exactly what uh you've been saying they lack the uh acknowledgment that it is a fantasy to restore American industry without transforming American society uh because to transform it you would have to do things like uh begin to uh have the government provide basic services like Medical Care and education uh in the same way that social democracies do that uh if you privatize Medical Care 18% of US GDP if you privatize education 50,000 a year in student debt then you're not going to have an internal Market that is necessary for industrialization and you're not going to be able to have an export Market because of the high cost of paying American labor that has to pay for its own health care and education we've been discussing this for the last year on Nima and the uh the narrative is unrealistic to the core and if you try to interject realism uh into the narrative and say Here's what's really needed uh in order to industrialize you're going to have to be so more socialist and the refusal of America to be socialist is puts us right back in the class war here is as much in business as it's going to be in Europe under the rightwing uh and the class war is not a way to industrialize uh because it in fighting labor it fights the necessity and the precondition for industrialization to occur on an international scale uh from the United States that's right they can't face it and they can't face that that over the last 40 years a society quite different from this one namely the Chinese have been able to achieve economic growth no one predicted no one foresaw not even over there in China did they understand what they were able to do you know just last week we saw you know another example of high-tech as they produced a better AI operation than anybody had done for a tiny fraction of the cost I mean how many exam you know whether it's solar panels or electric vehicles yeah I mean you know and they're opening a new University every month and we're closing them down every month and what do you think that means you know it's Michael's point it's it's the private funding of education is drying it up the making students have these absurd debts means they're not going to go to the universities anymore so we're reducing our pool of educated people when they're expanding their and they have a much bigger population OB I mean it it's everywhere screaming at you but they no no they think that Mr Trump wielding tariffs I kid you not this is the craziest thing think about it tariffs are one tool that governments have that's no question been that way for a long time there's an enormous literature which if you study international trade you study tariffs what they do what they don't do what Their secondary and tertiary effects are have been in this the notion that Mr Trump discovered in his first uh presidency that where other things were difficult for him to maneuver he had gotten the power to impose a tariff because an earlier Congress had given the president a kind of unusual freedom to wield the Tariff by the way done during a time when tars were not an important tool of the government now they're sorry and he discovered oh here's how I can do my theater of being the powerful one who comes in and gets things done I have a tariff it's like the old joke if you're a carpenter everything looks like a nail right if you're a tariff wielder every problem is solved valuable by the appropriate administration of a tariff and he's going to announce it and he can slap him notice the mistake he has always made he keeps saying and your clip addresses that that the Tariff that he imposes on Chinese Goods is paid for by the Chinese and so every teacher of Economics from the earliest level has to explain to his or her students know the is paid by the United States to its own government it's not about China China has 500 ways to get around the Tariff which you would know if you read the literature of international trade which goes through all of that he's not wielding it because it's the right tool the best tool the he's wielding it because he can because it's something he can do to fulfill the theater of the strong leader reversing the mistakes of the past so he is all day about that you know it's like deporting people he oh something else he can do very dramatic a tariff and a deportation order how exciting the last week he's issued I don't know 50 executive orders and 49 of them are being contested in the courts that's his problem they can't contest his tariff they gave him the power to go ahead and do that you know it's just it's REM and that's what we're watching with the hype to which the M mainstream media fall prey with the hype that this is the appropriate tool rather than one of the Fus he has to perform the political theater that got him elected well Richard the irony of all this is that for the last few years you and I have uh tried to explain how the rest of the world can free itself from neoliberalism and from the American Empire and it turns out that uh the person who's much more successful than either of us is Donald Trump uh and his gang from isolating the American Empire itself from the rest of the world who would have thought yeah and I'll take it one step further as a closer he may end up being the best recruiter and mobilizer of an internal left in the United States far better than the efforts of you me and many other people have proven to be he all spell out what he's doing the spectacle of parents and children being Shackled in an airplane and dumped on a runway in Colombia because that government is afraid not to do it that's not an image that's going to build for him that's an image that's going to build for us and the endless experience of One Police Department after another watching people yanked off the street and already they've made mistakes they've yanked Native Americans you know the irony you're deporting the people who were here before we the deporter ever got here you know they don't know who they're getting they don't know they've not gone through any procedure all of that will eventually go back to court what a mess this man is creating and there are going to be a lot of people who re-evaluate what's going on so yeah we may owe Mr Trump way more than we thought we might uh when he emerged well to do that we need a new political part party is an alternative to the Democrats uh that's the real challenge for the left can there be another political party yeah actually Jill St was talking about it recently I don't know well you know we should take we should take a clue the number one party in the French Parliament is a party that was formed two two years ago it's a unification of older parties yes but it's a new party that has to do a lot of the things a new party has to work out and the you know aan if that's the right word aan fan in Germany also a relatively new uh party you know and so new political formul formations are happening all over the place and it may in fact come over here and stimulate and Inspire and support comparable efforts here wouldn't be the first time yeah thank you so much Richard and Michael for being with us today great pleasure as always thank you thank you see you soon bye-bye
