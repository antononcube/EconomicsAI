hi everybody today is Wednesday November 27th and Michael Hudson and Richard wolf are here with us welcome back Michael and Richard to be glad to be here let's get started with what's going on between Russia and the United States in Ukraine we had a new Hypersonic missile HD in Ukraine and i t with Professor Ted postal I talk with Scott rer Larry Johnson all of these military analysts they're thinking this is a new weapon this is a new it hasn't it has the impact of a nuclear bomb but it doesn't have a nuclear warhead this is the importance of these new weapons that they they've used to send a message to the west but the question right now is is the message or has the message been perceived by the West in your opinion Richard you can start well for me as always I try to look at these things through the lens of what we know have learned from history and what we have learned from history is among other things that the capitalist era of the last three or four centuries has been remarkable uh for its technological changes that is uh remember Marx had a famous line all that's solid turns into air everything you assumed true will not be soon everything you assume necessary won't be soon so that it becomes crucial in the life of every capitalist but indeed of every worker of all of us that you cannot assume in your thinking and your planning that the way things will be next year are a simple projection of how they are now this is a misunderstanding of how the world has worked particularly in recent times and there's a debate about whether in the past it was all that different either but in any case we're clear that things change all the time all right it should have therefore been part of the thinking of the United States that the kind of military dominance that it had at the end of World War II that this might last a while but that it would be superseded and there would be abs absolutely no basis to presume that the only people that would make technological advances are Americans I mean that's silly nobody in their right mind would should hold such a notion and yet look at what happened as best I can tell and I'm listening and watching all the same people you just mentioned we have here a new technological development it's either an allog together new kind of missile or if I understand correctly a new adaptation of a missile that was being used uh from underwater submarine based missile but it really it's a new development one way or the other and it shows that the Russians have a certain capability you know the the military part of the Soviet Union was very Advanced and it's clear that at least under Putin they have made every effort to do after the Soviet Union the kind of commitment to military preparedness and Military studies and technological advance that the Soviets felt they had to do under Stalin and those who came after which shouldn't again surprise anyone I mean the whole history of the Soviet Union was the history of of a break through that became the demonized enemy of everybody in the west and they were constantly besieged and threatened and World War II was heavily inflicted upon them etc etc etc it's not surprising that they would a be committed to military development and B be able to develop their technology either on their own or with the help of China I'm sure we'll never know that story in its in its totality so here's what I find remarkable that the West seems to have been surprised but why why are you surprised what is it I mean even even commentators in the west have made a parallel with 1957 when I remember that in 1957 you know I'm a teenager but I'm already alive and aware and Russia sent to Sputnik the little the satellite uh up and they were the first ones to do it and everyone in the West Was astonished and what what is this here's my my my sense that the American delusion that the position it acquired with the collapse of the British Empire and then World Wars one and two would last forever was some kind of sign from God that the United States would be the center of the universe indefinitely and so when they learn no not the case they are traumatized with anxiety and fear but it's not because of the danger from outside it's because of the delusion that that led you not to calculate that this was part of what what you're going to face the West keeps escalating in Ukraine remember if you go back to the beginning of the war they were never going to put troops on the ground they were never going to give them the Abram's tank they were never going to give them the F-16 fighter PL they were never they were never they they gave it all as the war goes badly they escalate what they'll do and and it didn't dawn on them that the Russians will counter escalate which the Russians have done in the ways that they could at first numerically Russia is a large country Ukraine is a little one so the Russians Can field an army three or four times what the ukrainians can do if there is no other way or if that's the best or cheapest way then the Russians will escalate that way which they they did and that helped them be victorious which they have been okay now they they made that decision and by the way for me that was the most astounding thing that a lame duck president who has only a few weeks left who has the who his own party decided that he was not competent to run for president anymore would be allow to make the decision to to to free up the ukrainians to shoot those missiles into what in the that there wasn't an outcry about that tells you much about American politics very little about anything else okay the Russians then having successfully escalated before have now successfully escalated again with this new missile and again we see the United stat oh terrible and and by the way things are being said over the last 3 or 4 days that show you how hysterical the British and the French have been making noises about putting their own troops into Ukraine are you crazy answer is yes you're crazy with fear and anxiety the guy who's the head of the the Navy the naval forces a Dutch Admiral uh makes comments about preemptive H yeah bar what did did this is nuts this is all nuts this is you know hysteria it tells you there must be unbelievable frantic calls uh around the collective West trying to figure out what's going on what to but it's unnecessary there something very very primitive going on here I guess that's what I want to get across there's this there's this problem of not having calculated that the Soviets might be really good at military because they were threatened in the entire 70 years of the Soviet let me remind everyone 1917 is the Soviet Revolution 1918 the the troops of the United States France Britain and Japan invaded the new Soviet Union 10,000 American troops landed inside the Soviet Union and coordinated militarily with the white Army in the Civil War that racked Russia from 1918 to 1920 Japan which was the fourth country whose troops landed in to put down the revolution they didn't leave Russia until 1922 so and Lenin dies in 1923 so the whole beginning of the Soviet Union is characterized by military threat I mean if you know that you can't be surprised that they put an enormous emphasis on Military preparedness and then when you watch a few years later that Hitler with all that he had assembled marches into the Soviet Union and is squashed like an insect as a result you realize my goodness the Russians may be poor which they are they were very poor then they are poor they are backward they are illiterate they are farmers and they beat the crap out of the Germans you have to then ask do you really want to go to war against the Russian doesn't seem to work out Napoleon had to learn that Hitler had to learn it Kaiser vilhelm in the first world war he had to learn it now the Americans have to learn it hey hey hello and then you're surprised they have a new missile are you nuts who are you that's the irony for me it's the it's the West self delusion that is being undone it was for two years now and I'll stop with it for two years it has been impossible for go Biden or Boris Johnson or uh Mr macaroon there in France for them to understand that the Russians may win it's an unthinkable thought remember all those lines we will do whatever it takes what kind of language is that that's the language of people who are so sure that it's Unthinkable that they now have to face that the unthinkable is probably what's going to happen and that they will come up with some from Madison Avenue but they will sit down and the Russians and the and the ukrainians will negotiate how much Ukraine gives away in land to the Russians which is the only issue left for them to to bargain a little bit over you know they're going to get everything else the Russians most of Europe already assumes it but they're going to lose and it's very difficult for them to lose let me last Point let me give you a statistic which I didn't know which I learned this morning in 197 if this is true in 1979 the United States accounted for 79% of global trade in agriculture today the United States accounts for 12.3% of the global trade in agriculture that is as stunning a statement about what has happened to the United States in the world economy as I could think of American farmers are now horribly upset by the import that's what I learned today of used cooking oil from China and Brazil because we now you know we burn that kind of oil in Le of petroleum in it's a biofuel right it it's a substitute and the Chinese are sending us their garbage and the Americans are buying it because it's much cheaper than the squashed soybeans and oil that they have normally and and out of that story becomes the learning that the United States is in no position to control any of it anymore not the corn not the wheat not the soybean none of it it is and I don't think anybody gets it it's all of these little statistics are kept apart so they don't amalgamate into a story that might make and the same is true in the military and that's I think what we're watching I stop I talk too long yeah just you've mentioned the link to the Soviet Union the Russian President vadir Putin right after this attack he he was talking about this new weapon this new missile Hypersonic missile he said we are all he he's me he mentioned himself and other people in that meeting together with the bomb we are all come from the Soviet Union it means that our or in of course I mean look at him I mean he literally his early career his his education he is a product of the Soviet system you no question and you know and that's a system that had its strength and had its weak you know like any other system Michael well you begin uh your question by referring to the American war against Russia this is you and other people are for the first time this week referring to it that way for what it is it's not the Ukrainian war against Russia it's the American war against Russia that's very significant the people realize that uh earlier today uh the ukrainians uh or I should say the Americans and the British in Ukraine uh fired uh new rounds of attack missiles in Storm Shadow missiles against Russia meanwhile three days ago uh Russia closed off the airspace over the uh missile area where it had launched uh uh the missile against Ukraine Ukraine a few uh weeks ago a week ago and uh it's uh reestablishing all sorts of new silos for missiles aimed both with atomic and non-atomic uh arms uh this is clear and uh yesterday uh foreign minister lavro gave a very important speech and he pointed out that NATO is no longer a defensive Alliance there's no longer pretense that it's defending Europe against the imminent uh Russia military Invasion as if they're going to be troops marching right through through uh to to Germany again uh the only uh the idea of Defense in NATO has been transformed the uh the idea of Defense must be to destroy all non-nato countries to destroy not only Russia but China and by extension members of the global majority majority who seek independence from the unipolar us- centered world that seems crazy but here's what uh Vice what lavro said quote just the other day the head of the NATO military committee Robert Bower that's exactly who uh Richard was just talking about said that this is no longer enough and that in order to achieve the goals of protecting the NATO member states it is necessary to preemptively strike at the targets of the Russian Federation which in NATO's opinion could pose a threat to the organization's member states all decency has been discarded and the true intentions are already being announced publicly well when you take this speech in conjunction with what uh President Putin has said uh he said that uh any introduction of weapons that could be ATT Atomic or missiles that are designed to carry Atomic as well as non-atomic missiles will be treated as an atomic attack on Russia because why would anybody put a missile with an atom bomb on it right next to Russia's borders in Ukraine if you're not going to attack on Russia and when the head of NATO says uh we're not putting these missiles with atomic weapons there to defend in case Russia attacks us we're going to attack Russia first now the United States has long had plans for a preemptive strike Abel Archer uh going all the way back uh to that plans uh uh for an atomic war uh and uh the man who I worked with 50 years ago Herman Khan uh wrote the book unthinking thinking the unthinkable saying yes there can be an atomic war there will be survivors that made him uh the the film uh fil films are made on him Doctor Strange Love was based on this so the Americans assume that yes there can and uh they are willing to upgrade it apparently they think that well President Putin hasn't R hasn't attacked us yet uh maybe he won't well the re I'm sure your military advisers who you've had on your show uh very good got R and the rest of them and said well uh Putin doesn't have to attack uh the uh the NATO Europe because it's already winning so much in Ukraine why it what it wants to do is consolidate its gains for what Putin explained in February 2022 uh the aims to densify Ukraine to uh protect Russia by uh accepting its russian-speaking provinces who voted to become part of Russia not to Ukraine since they were being treated like subhumans by the Ukrainian Nazis uh he he he wants to finish winning the war on the battlefield uh and that's just exactly what's happening uh and the war can only be fought on the battlefield but that's exactly what the West can't do uh Richard has explained some of the reasons why the West can't do it uh but you've just seen also the last 24 hours uh the uh Israeli uh agreement apparently under us pressure uh to stop bombing uh Lebanon we don't know the deals yet because Lebanon said wait a minute the contract you've given us is not at all what we've uh decided on but the fact is that uh Israel realized that it cannot win a war against Lebanon because it's fought with troops the only kind of war that Israel can wage is by bombing well that's the only kind of war that NATO can wage against Russia by bombing there's no way in which you can have troops there because to have enough troops that's necessary to occupy a country you would have to have a military draft and if you have a military draft uh the British or French or Americans will have the same reaction that the ukrainians have they'll they'll vote the party out of power uh because they don't want a draft uh no uh democ no country that has uh a political leadership subject to the will of Voters uh can ever have a draft again that means that the war can only be fought with bombs that's why the uh British and the American Storm Shadow and attacks are being used and uh when President Putin says uh we're because we're not really fighting Ukraine because these are not ukrainians they're steering and programming where the bomb bombs are going to fall these are the Americans and the British so we're going to go after the uh after the countries that are actually launching the bombs uh and that means Britain maybe even the United States uh Putin has said uh but they there's a lot of discussion about well certainly there are the military bases that are surrounding uh uh you Ukraine on the way to Russia like in Romania uh when the United States put uh the uh the missiles uh in Romania they said well we're not fighting Russia it's in case Iran should invade us well the thought of Iran invading uh Romania is pretty silly as you can imagine Russia knew that this is uh the kind of silly talk that the West is using uh but the point is that uh just as uh uh Israel couldn't uh defeat Lebanon with troops NATO can't defeat Russia to troops so there's the only thing they have is to continue to bomb Russia and they think that Putin is chicken and uh Putin is waiting for the appropriate time uh if there's a really serious bomb that doesn't just fall in a forest or in a uh an oil Depot or something to go Kaboom and say this is it well uh President Biden has a response he talked to president Netanyahu and Netanyahu said the Samson option is what you want you bomb him use the atomic bomb and uh you you tell them do you really want to blow up the world we're going to bomb you but if you bomb us the whole world will go that's a Samson Bringing Down the temple the whole world that's uh what we're in and when somebody's seile and uh knows that he's losing the brain and therefore his personality and when he's surrounded by the crazy people that uh you have blinkin and Sullivan and the rest and the crazy NATO uh General that uh Richard mentioned uh this is the situation we're in today when we have Donald Trump it seems that in the eyes of Russians there could be some sort of Hope for the incoming Administration I'm talking about the Trump Administration and have you heard about Sebastian gor he's going to be the director of counterterrorism for Donald Trump and here is what he said Richard tip away that the president has mentioned he will say to that murderous former KGB Colonel that fug who runs the Russian Federation you will negotiate now or the aid that we have given to Ukraine thus far will look like peanuts that's how he will force those gentlemen to come to an arrangement that stops the Bloodshed yeah the the problem Richard right now is that there is no Mutual understanding between Russia and the United States and I talked with colel Jack Bo he's in Brussels and he's a military analyst he showed me that this new weapon this new missile is capable of hitting all the territory of the United States and and you see these people are just going with the rhic in the mainstream media it doesn't seem that they do have some sort of understanding of what's going on between Russia and how dangerous this war can get and for Ukraine what's Jake Solan just recently said that ukrainians are not capable of winning they have they don't have Manpower it doesn't matter how much more weapons we're going to give them but you see escalation on their part well let me tell you again just how I how I see it and I'm going to do the history again you have a declining Empire it's the Empire of the United States and its satellites which include all those European countries and Canada and Japan the G7 okay that's a declining Empire from a declining Empire fire here is what we have learned to expect desperate acts because those are the kind of Acts performed by people who need to convince themselves that they are not losing their power which they are so the more they talk like this the more the situation doesn't change so they have to escalate their rhetoric and Mr gka there is a that's that's all he's there for lots of Babble about how tough we all are it's childish and it's historical Amnesia that's playing the Chinese the Russians they are coming up in the world the global South is coming up in the world they're not playing the role of subordinate that they did before when I gave you that statistic about the United States role in global agricultural trade dropping from 79% to 12.3% that's the reality that none of this rhetoric changes the United States is in Decline and I by the way Mr Trump is putting into Power people who are diametrically opposed to one another he has people definitely who want to come to a resolution with Russia guess is Mr Trump wants to come to a resolution he will do better politically by being the president who brought peace in Ukraine than anything else he can do his economic program is incoherent there is no way to make sense of it except that it's a person who doesn't understand what he's doing and doesn't care I'm assuming people tell him what the consequences of his economic acts are and he simply doesn't care that's okay I he won't be the first one like that but he will do better politically by bringing peace than by continuing this war so he may have Mr girka or whatever his name exactly is out there to make the noise but while the noise is being made the deal underneath the noise that's being made and in that deal here's what I can assure you nobody cares what happens to Ukraine barely the ukrainians do and they've already suffered what they're going to suffer you know Millions have left the country many of whom will never come back they've had half their country destroyed it'll take them a long time to rebuild that's what they will concentrate on peace is what they want let me remind those of you don't pay attention two weeks ago was the most recent polling done by the Gallop poll that's an American company the Galla pole has been regularly polling the Ukrainian people asking are you for peace and negotiations or do you want to pursue the war last week for the first time the percentage of people saying we want peace in negotiations went above 50% it's now about 53 54 it was the same week that the United States escalated by telling uh zalinski got use those missiles it's a the decision to use the missiles was made at the same time that we went over 50% of the ukrainians who are actually living in the war have had enough they don't want anymore they're willing to have negotiations they're willing to seed uh territory and all the rest so I think what you're seeing and I'm not arguing that it isn't dangerous I'm not arguing that you might get a person and maybe that'll be Trump who throws all caution to the winds and again history there's only one country on Earth that ever Used military um nuclear weapons that's the United States so you can use that as a betting person to see who's going to use it first again one for one country it's again no other country is in that position it means that if the United States is defending itself against the possibility that m Mr Putin will use nuclear weapons think how much stronger his claim is because he's saying he's defending himself against a country that already did use nuclear weapons and not when it was itself under attack it dropped them in Japan and by its own statements in order to reduce the number of casual the American Military might have had to suffer if they had had to invade Japan rather than get a negotiated end of the war and that's a debated topic I know but even give them that they are willing to nuclear bomb other people who's got then the right to defend what so that's why when you have arguments that are as as weak is this then I don't think the argument is anymore the issue it's like a children having a fight on the playground one of them says I'm going to hit you with a truck well you understand what he means but he can't wield a truck it's it's it's telling you he's desperate he can't solve his problem so he has to fantasize that's what I get here I think these are fantasy fantasies of preemptive strike fantasies of nuclear War you're desperate look twice I believe Mr Putin over the last two years when confronted with statements made about escalation did want and did remind the world that we have nuclear weapons hello you maybe want to think about what you're saying and doing because we have them and if you force us we will use them right the the United States isn't being forced by anything but it's confronting its own laps it didn't take into account the Russians may come up with a new weapon that's what people in an arms race try to do I'm sure the United States military is working on ways to come up with new weapons only the United States though has the the arrogance to imagine that the Russians can't do this also the Chinese have matched every technical leadership the United States has we have Google they have the equivalent we have apple they have the equivalent we have fill-in the blank they have the equivalent hello they're going to come up with a technical breakthrough sooner or later they already prod produce the best quality electric vehicle at the lowest price they won that they're going to win others one of the reasons you sit down and work things out with Russia and China is because this arms race is [Music] crazy because it's so unmanageable and who proves it the Russians just did with a new missile reminding everybody and the the West my guess I predict which I don't believe in the west will get over its hysteria it'll realize okay we got to be careful now for a couple of years until we catch up that's the position everybody else has been in relative to the United States welcome you aren't the one country anymore it's over it's over in agricultural trade it's over in the dollar it's over it's over it's over this is being hammered and sooner or later even if it's done in a demagogic way American politicians will get on that truck and say we're the ones that are going to save us in this situation by working out a deal because that's a lot safer than rattling the Sabers and that person will win that election yeah I think he brail you would be I I was surprised that here in Brazil the electric cars or hybrid cars or the Chinese companies are competing with each other there is no that's unbelievable yeah well you know China has about by the way for people who don't know China has I think 20 or 25 distinct companies competing byd is the big monster but they have a bunch of them and some of them a little bit better in in the you know the The Battery Technology and others have this but yes sooner or later what's happening in Brazil will happen everywhere else and by the way the United States is shooting itself in the foot with all of this American companies because of a 100% tariff on Chinese electric vehicles by the way imposed by Biden the before Biden the Tariff was about 27 % Trump tariff Trump leaves Biden comes in raises the Tariff just to show that he has no independent politics at all and so okay so the United States if it wants to buy the best cheapest electric vehicle any American company would have to pay double whatever the prices you'd have to give the Chinese you know $30,000 for the vehicle and then give Uncle Sam $30,000 worth of tariff so it cost you 60 Meanwhile your Brazilian competitor can get the car for $330,000 or the truck this is an enormous competitive Advantage the American can will have to pay 50 Grand to get an inferior GE G GM or Ford or Tesla that's the joke it's very bad for the future of the United States what they are doing they are protecting jobs in the in in the car industry in this country correct but they are losing jobs from all the competitive disadvantage that happens when you jack up the price of a crucial input to your country's competitors relative to other parts of the world that's why in in Europe they don't have 100% tariff they're not even discussing it their tariff is below 50% which is bad enough and the Chinese are slapping them on the wrist for doing it but at least but what is happening to a country that does this you're creating the conditions again I warn my American political audience you're setting yourself up for a politician who will come along explain clearly and simply what I just said and said I'm not doing that I'm not disadvantaging the American capitalist from his competitors by imposing these silly tariffs and once that's explained all of the hoopla around the Tariff will disappear as it did 30 years ago when we had the beginning of the neoliberal age and everybody believed free trade was the royal road to endless Prosperity that's nonsense but the notion of protection with tariffs that's nonsense too Michael jump in well Richard and I seem to uh be the two new Dr Dooms uh explaining all this uh to give some background for what he mentioned about the United States uh being the first country to drop the atom bomb that was actually intended uh the action of dropping it on Japan was a move against Russia the reason it was dropped at that time was uh to prevent Russia uh entering the second world war by invading uh from uh from Asia uh against Japan and uh Truman wanted to have the peace before Russia could uh move uh to protect its uh Siberian territories in the west against Japan and recover the islands that uh Japan had seized uh the the bomb was dropped because of uh the Cold War had began and the dropping of the bomb on Japan not only ended World War II it initiated the Cold War from the beginning from the very outset uh all of the atomic Weaponry uh has been uh based on the US Russia conflict now expanded to become to include China Iran and uh the whole 85% of the rest of the world now Richard also mentioned uh Goro the uh what do we do about the fact that over the weekend Sebastian Doro a crazy person who uh is ver uh passionately in favor of atomic war against Russia now was appointed security advisor the first thing that Mr Goo did was saying that he's in full agreement with uh blinken and solivan on the Biden War position he said the the Trump position is exactly the same as uh that of the Biden neocons well uh again uh as Richard pointed out there seem to be a lot of different uh people with different ideas in Trump's Administration why uh Trump uh just a week or so before had given a wonderful speech saying that it was time to wind down the National Security State he said that America's Wars uh pushed by the CIA and the National Security Council and America's polit politicalization of the law under the FBI used to attack uh enemies of the other party whoever that might be uh have been destroying America well that was a wonderful anti-war talk and certainly reflected uh the uh voters who had supported him instead of blinkin or who just stayed instead of Biden uh and had just stayed home rather than voting for the war party of uh uh Harris uh that was uh uh he on the one hand he played to them why would he have appointed someone like Goro and what does it uh really mean that he has almost his entire uh cabinet is so passionately uh anti-russian and uh pro-war seems crazy on the face of it the only idea that I can uh uh explain why he has this seeming uh opposition or sort of schizophrenia of his appoin is uh he's he's terrified that the Deep State the CIA NSA and the FBI is going to fight against him and do something as nasty as what happened to JFK uh he he wants to protect himself certainly to the point at which he actually takes office and can have his appointees begin to uh stop the uh uh the Deep State and uh uh do what he wanted all along uh uh to do to sort of uh solidify and start his uh pres second presidency on the first day he says by uh establishing a peace uh in Ukraine and I think he in the last few days he's been indicating what his idea of peace is uh it's it's not uh it's not War uh I think he hopes to make a transactional uh agreement with Putin uh I think that what is in his mind and if the crazy idea uh is not my idea it's the idea that I'm getting from what his advisers have said is that U we uh we can make uh a deal and it's the kind of deal that Senators have said oh what America wants and Ukraine uh is is not simply a place to have uh Atomic weapons against Russia we want Ukraine's land very rich soil talk if we can control Ukraine's uh agricultural exports if we can have block Black Rock and other companies by the Ukrainian Farmland then we don't have to uh export American grain we can continue to control World agricultural trade not simply by selling the products of American Farms but by selling the products of the Ukrainian Farms that uh we uh Black Rock and other for American investors want to take over Oakland Institute um in California has uh published every few months a whole uh running story of the American multinationals takeover of uh Ukrainian land well then uh you have Lindsey Graham and others saying well we not only want the the land we want their raw materials resources uh Ukraine has lithium even more important Ukraine has uh rare rare earth metals that are needed to make the magnets uh that are a part of making uh chips uh that that work we need the electricity uh that the various rare earth metals have well uh it's rare earth metals take a long time to uh dig up and uh C uh cause enormous environmental damage unfortunately uh and also a long time to refine China controls most of the market in this because other countries didn't want the environmental cleanup costs of uh having to do this so China let uh Taiwanese investors come in uh so the Central Committee people have told me and uh buy up uh these raw materials and essentially we're selling uh Rare Earth uh only at the cost of the labor and profits uh and and designed to produce them not taking advantage of the enormous raw materials rent that you can have by selling uh the rare earth at what it would cost foreign countries to develop if indeed they could develop them rapidly and it's not something that can be uh done rapidly so I I I think that uh uh Trump imagines that he can say all right President Putin we're going to give you what you want we're going to let you keep the lands that you've taken uh you want to densify uh Ukraine we'll go along with that we have no love for Mr zalinski uh and uh you you can prevent NATO's weapons there we're not interested in going to war what we want is economically we want the land and the raw materials we want everything economic which is the whole reason to have a country apart from having a place to blow you up uh very quickly if we so desire so I think he hopes to do that uh and I I can uh imagine what uh Mr Putin and Mr lavro and Mr medv uh are all going to say uh in response they're going to say well the problem is uh Mr Trump you we may make an agreement with you but how do we get Congress uh to go along with it how do we get the CIA in the Deep State and the Army from simply ignoring what you said like they did before when they wouldn't follow your desire to uh decouple from Afghanistan then uh they didn't do it uh and how can we trust uh the West to make an agreement but most of all it's much too early for an agreement the time you have a peace agreement with another country is When The War is Over You don't have a peace agreement while the war is going on and Russia is moving very rapidly uh to uh take over uh Ukraine very moving very quickly to the neeper river which is sort of the dividing line in Ukraine and on the Russian uh Eastern part side of Ukraine that's where uh the raw materials are and much of the Farmland uh and Russia is going to say well we're going to leave a uh we're going to follow what Mr Med VI had produced in a a map we're going to leave a rump Ukraine uh centered and the gala territory of lvav this the Nazi territories uh are going to be there but we're going to den naify them uh which means probably uh getting rid of the entire Administration there uh we're going to have a a show trial uh a nberg type trial uh to put the Nazis uh in jail and uh we we may leave Ukraine all the way up to Kev or we may not depending on uh the details that to be worked out uh but we're not going to make uh your your agreement uh might have worked out um in 19 in 2022 but that's over now uh we're going to have to wait until the war is over and negotiate from the position of what happens then and obviously it's going to be a position of of us strength and uh there will be a delay and delay and delay I'm sure the uh President Putin will be very polite if indeed he ever dains to talk to Donald Trump uh but when he said well all of your statements are uh when you were in office uh you broke the uh the ad the treaty for uh missiles short- range missiles uh you you broke every treaty that American had made uh we we really can only uh have peace when we're in control that means not the United States in control that's lost its control so uh this is uh uh essentially I I think the there must be somebody um smart enough in the administration that even if they won't tell uh Donald Trump uh your plan won't work uh they uh they know that it won't work and uh all they have left our bombs uh not only the attacks but the atomic weapons so that that's what it is I think the next big move that we're going to see is uh Russian attack not Atomic it doesn't need an atomic weapon it it can use all sorts of other weapons it has to thoroughly Wipe Out the American military bases in Poland in Romania and even Beyond imagine a bomb falling on MI6 right across the river from London Bridge uh uh on the temps just imagine uh you know what it can do it can say well this isn't attack Ukraine's not attacking us England's attacking us from MI6 you know boom there it goes uh I think it'll first hit Romania Poland and maybe uh the American troop concentrations in Germany maybe the American troops uh in uh in England possibly if there are any uh troops in uh in France there too but I think that's going to be the most re likely Outlook yeah Richard before wrapping up do you have something to add yeah I I'm a little worried about what Michael said Vis A being uh Dr Doom he and I somehow um I'm not I understand the risks I understand the dangers I share the the moments of anger when I watch these leaders taking unspeakable risks uh since I know many of them one way or another even personally it it's horrible the arrogance particularly of the West is just is just horrible uh on the other hand much of what passes for politics in our country and Lord knows the election we just had did it again is all about political theater and you know most of the people performing know it's theater and most of the audience knows it's theater we don't take it seriously we don't take it literally it is necessary to to get interesting images across to the people and then they vote on those images but most of the blah blah blah just it's it's a kind of window dressing I don't want to go so far to say it has no effect of course it has an effect but it's very very secondary you know when Michael said that a lot of the people who vote are in fact voting for war or peace yes that's what I mean it's the big issues that in the end are somehow in the head when they go in and vote and I think what they're learning is that the endless war look that's part of what Mr Trump's success has been he at least says something about endless the very phrase endless Wars he helps to make a negative he can use it against his enemies and they're not very good at defending themselves against it sorry yeah uh so I'm hopeful I want to end with that I'm hopeful that we come to an end with this tit fortat escalation that all of the people are frightened now not just the Russians wondering how far the West will go but the West having to wonder how far the Russians will go beyond Ukraine not in the fanciful invasion of Europe what in the world does Russia want or what could it do with five EUR ukraines they're having enough trouble controlling one Ukraine what are they going to invade France and Germany and Italy it's silly but that new missile that can be shot anywhere anywhere in Europe is instantaneously I think they have four minutes or five minutes from the time they can detect it to what they're going to do about it and they can't do anything in four or five minutes you know uh so they're going to have to come to terms with that the escalation is a two-way street I think they thought they didn't have that problem they could escalate and all that would happen is Russia would whack Ukraine about which they don't care now it looks like they've brought things to the past where Mr Putin might as he says he has now the right to do bother the French or the Germans or the Italians or the British or the Americans in their home country he do to them what they just did to him I'm hoping and I think it's possible that that will accelerate that part of the Trump base that wants peace does not want this above all remember that for the vast majority of Americans good or bad they don't want any sacrifice for Ukraine it's just not aaable OB object but I do have to go so my apologies thank you for making this program Nema thank you Michael I learn from every one of these so I I I'm I'm very happy to participate both as a contributor but also as your as an audience of our Collective effort well I meant to compliment you Richard when I said uh included you in Dr Doom as I'm always cost that the you uh you are uh simply being realistic but uh uh to the uh to the vested interests here anyone being realistic like you and me is called Dr Doom because for them our realistic world is their Doom that's right that's right yeah which is actually good because it means they are understanding us on some level all right folks thank you so much Richard Michael bye bye
