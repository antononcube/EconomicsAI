Hi everyone and welcome back. I'm very pleased today to be joined again by Michael Hudson uh professor of political economy to discuss uh US economic coion against allies. Uh so welcome back to the program. >> It's good to be back Glenn. >> So there is this uh interesting development. Uh I mean I my thesis is that in the unipolar era states uh that followed the US could would be rewarded and those who did not could be punished because there were no alternatives. Now in the multipolar order the game appears to change at least the rules of the game. That is opponents of the United States and also neutral states uh who don't want to ally too closely they have the option of diversifying their economic partnerships and thus any effort to pressure them. It simply results in um incentive to diversify more away from the United States. In other words, the US doesn't really have that much advantage as we see visav China or Russia. Um, in contrast, I think we see allies who allies of the US who are worried about the rise of other great powers and have well hitched their wagons completely to the US. they seem more prepared to sacrifice even their own economic interests to preserve US leading position but also their own ties and connections with the US and uh this puts the US in a very favorable position. It can take advantage uh of this subordination of allies. Uh the US can then also sever them from other centers of powers to extract be it political security or economic concession. So I guess my my my point is it seems that the US has it's easier to uh have an economic war against allies and uh yeah it's through this that I found a article of yours I recently read very interesting because you compare some of the things the United States is doing today to the policies of Britain and France in the 19th century. I was wondering if you could um yeah flesh out your arguments. >> Well, I want to uh take issue from the start with your uh use of the word opponents of the United States. I I guess you're referring to the bricks, China, Russia, Iran, and the other countries that are meeting. uh in all of their announcements that their presidents and representatives made at these meetings, there wasn't a word about United States uh uh as an opponent or in fact there was no mention of the United States at all. They look at themselves as uh as being under attack by the United States much as the United States is uh indeed uh treating treating Europe. What's they're they're not trying to retaliate from the United States. They're trying to defend themselves against uh Trump's demands that he's making of uh these these countries. And the he's the demands he's making are the same for the bricks as they are for uh Britain, for the European countries, and for for Japan. And in fact, right now uh there's uh in in Korea, you have discussions right now in K even Korea. one of the US allies that the United States would like to drain is uh standing uh standing up and uh the US com and the United States has threatened Korea like Japan saying if you don't uh lend $350 billion to me uh the United States to be handled by me President Trump to decide how to spend it and you'll get 10% of the earnings if there are and we get 90%. If you don't do that, we're going to raise tariffs on you and create a crisis uh and you'll have unemployment and uh that'll lead voters to vote against you and uh you know, we'll create create a crisis. And uh just the other day, the US commerce secretary Howard uh Lutnik uh told the Koreans bluntly, quoted in yesterday's Financial Times, quote, "The Japanese signed a contract, 350 billion. The Koreans either accept the deal or pay the tariffs, black and white. Pay the tariffs or accept the deal." Well, that's just what he's told uh Europe. There's no uh the question is what makes Europe uh different from uh the uh the BRICS countries that are trying to uh make an alternative saying well all right uh Trump is threatening to deprive our export industries of access to the United States market if we agree to his demands it's going to cost us more money to uh just uh pay tribute ute to the United States in what's really a protection racket. Either uh pay us money uh and accept our import uh uh duties and our demands for you to uh dismantle your industry and invest here or we'll raise tariffs and cause a crisis for you. Same demand is made all over. And you asked why is the United States making you know this demand on on uh Europe specifically? The demand's exactly the same. Europe is giving given up because it's made uh uh its leaders I won't say Europe certainly not its voters but the European leaders uh basically NATO uh leaders in the in the EU foreign ministers have made a decision that they'd rather live in the short run like politicians do and not have dru uh destruction of their industry than live in the long run, they have a choice. Either uh the the choice was made before 2022 when they uh essentially dis agreed to blow up the North Sea pipeline or let the United States blow it up and depend completely on the US for oil. They said, "Well, at least um we can depend on the United States." That's what Özil Leavon Delay said. we can depend on the United States. And yet uh Trump has made it clear most recently uh yesterday in in Britain uh when he said well you know we uh if you do any move that is at the cost of American industry for instance uh in information technology uh imposing uh minimum taxes about uh against US uh information tech technology companies like Europe's doing will simply raise tariffs on you. Trump then raised and of course Europe has already tried to to stand up for this but uh Vonda and who was doing the negotiation never even tried to fight back. She said well at least what we can depend on Trump never to change his mind or change the deal. At least we have certainty. Well that's crazy. There was no certainty at all. Uh and so uh Europe doesn't have it. And the question is Europe had two choices. The choice before 2022 was to have a balanced and basically independent economy as long as its industrial economy was uh symbiotic with uh Russia as a raw material supplier of oil, gas, fertilizer and other basic materials. Uh the advantage of this for Europe was well Europe uh uh Russia and China and the bricks are the growing part of the world economy. The US is a shrinking part of the U economy. Uh and Trump is Trump's policies are actually destroying US agriculture, US industry. It's making the United States uh uninvestable. Uh companies are closing down now and uh it's becoming uh the profits are going down because of the imports especially on steel and aluminum. And uh so uh there uh you think why on earth would uh Europe agree to uh tie its long-term fortunes to the United States and dependent uh lose its uh domestic self-sufficiency and self-reliance that it had as long as it had free access open access to uh Russian raw material. raw materials and energy to energy that costs five or six times as high and once it's become lost this independence it loses the option that the brick countries have taken and saying well we're willing to lose the US market in order uh because that's a shrinking market over time there will be a cost in the short term but that cost is less le than having to pay $350 billion uh to uh is a shakedown fee uh to the United States just to keep our short-term market open. The the the US market is not worth $350 billion either to Japan or or Korea. the each each of these countries could have paid $350,000 50 they could have paid $350 billion to subsidize their own exporters so that they could afford to cope with the tariffs. Uh they they didn't do it. They they just uh Japan just surrendered. Korea right now is refusing to surrender. And uh yesterday its foreign minister uh team was in China trying to say isn't there some way that we could suppose that we lose the American market. We're faced with a demand that we can't possibly make. We may walk away from them. what deal could we make with you and your Asian uh neighbors uh in order for us to have our own self-reliant individual uh geographic system of self-sufficiency so that we're immune from the kind of threats that the United States is making. Well, Europe has not made itself uh immune from these threats. And uh a lot part of this is uh military uh again and again the leaders of Germany and France as well as uh Britain have said well uh we need America's support in case Russia mounts a land invasion and is willing to sacrifice 20 million of its soldiers trying to march across Europe to the British Isles. Well, this is crazy. This is a parallel universe threat. Uh it's it it has no basis in the reality because no country and no industrial country in today's world can afford a military infantry invasion of any other country because not only would uh masses of soldiers die but uh such a country would uh if it tried to impose a draft would be thrown out of office right away. So uh you you have Europe's policy makers uh essentially acting on behalf of NATO which is controlled by the United States instead of on behalf of uh their own voters. Then you have the public relations polls showing that the voters don't want war in Ukraine. the voters don't want their social spending in Europe to be cut back in order to uh spend the uh limited uh budgets on military instead of on domestic uh domestic things. So it's not a question of the United States focusing its demands on the allies. It's focus it's demands are across the board. They're the same for every country. either we'll close off our markets or you have to pay us uh money not to disrupt uh your economy and cause at least temporary short-term chaos. Other countries are protecting themselves from chaos. Britain is not protecting itself from chaos. That's that's the basic problem that I see. Well, I I think a lot of it is tied, as you suggested, to the war in Ukraine, though, because when the cold war came to an end, uh, in other words, the Europeans became less dependent on uh the US as a security provider, given that the cold war was finished, we saw that the main objectives in Europe uh were that of autonomy. They were speaking of using collective bargaining power to have an economic position um that would make them an equal to the United States. The Europeans even immediately in 1992 as the Soviet Union had just collapsed uh a month or two thereafter began to discuss how about we develop our own military. Obviously was no threat but this was also an effort to have more autonomy. Uh they wanted their own foreign policy uh and pursue this as well. that is a collective EU foreign policy. So this is what you can do when the dominant state can't convert its uh security dependence into economic loyalty. uh but what you've seen since the Ukraine war though when the external threats appear uh and the security dependence becomes evident uh it's quite predictable that the dominant power the security provider will then seek to extract economic and political concession of its vassels or protectorates and uh uh so I don't know from my perspective this has been a key argument of mine since NATO started the conflict in Ukraine with the coup in 2014 is Europe is putting itself in a very vulnerable position because uh the US you know we keep saying friends and allies which is nice and well I mean we are close and we should be close but states behave like states and uh when you make yourself excessively dependent on another state uh it will seek to have some uh material benefits from this uh But uh you you mentioned all that the conquest of Europe as it is. Uh >> before you move on, you use the word security provider. That's a quite a euphemism and I want to do an eriter's analysis of that. The United States is imposing unparalleled insecurity on Europe. you because you have both uh Germany and France and Britain uh offering to provide long range missiles uh to Ukraine in order to use against uh Russia and to launch against Russia especially Moscow and St. Petersburg that are in range of these missiles that are to be sent and the US uh the European leaders say uh like Starmer yesterday they want to bomb Russia. Well, both uh President Putin and foreign minister Lavrov have said uh if a uh foreign missile is launched by Ukraine against Russia, we realize that our fight is not against Ukraine. Our fight is against NATO. This is the war between NATO and Russia. And uh the uh if a bomb comes from a German uh manu manufactury, then we're going to bomb the source. We're going to bomb Germany, at least the factory in Germany, maybe the power plants uh that supply energy to this factory. Same thing in France, same thing uh in Britain. Now the question is once you have intercontinental missiles uh flying from Russia uh Russia doesn't need atomic weapons. It has a much broader range of weapons than uh NATO countries have and uh these these weapons are not atomic. Uh and the NATO countries themselves are pretty much out of weaponry. They've given them all to Ukraine and to Israel and uh they they're uh any thought of actually engaging in war is such a fantasy that it would be like Bambi meets Goliath. uh Russia would respond very quickly and the result is be because of the belligerance of Vondlayan and uh the Estonian uh assistant uh Kellis uh this is putting Europe in insecurity and in great military danger the d there is no danger at all from an armed military infantry invasion and without a military invasion you can't control and gain gain control over another country. That's what Russia is doing now in Ukraine. And you see the uh the enormous problems that it has even in Ukraine. What countries can do and the democratic form of war is by missiles simply to destroy the other countries. wars. Uh the modern post World War II modern type of war is mutual destruction by missile by air whether it's from submarines or landbased uh based missiles. That's the kind of war and hence insecurity uh that Europe is going to have. So, uh, the the not only is Europe's plan to sort of have a bastardized Keynesianism and military Keynesianism of well, let's spend our money on military industry and uh that will maybe create the employment that we've lost in our civilian industry as a result of having to depend on American gas and oil instead of Russian gas and oil, but uh it's going to uh it threatens the actual existence of the European countries. Russia's uh made it clear that it has no interest in taking over Europe. It wants to be simply left alone. And uh Europe is is uh obeying the United States not simply in these tariff demands and the givebacks that uh Trump is making but in a much deeper connection of following the US uh cold war now increasingly hot war uh leadership. That's what's uh essentially bankrupting Europe. It's uh it it's joined uh a new military axis that is uh uh in no way militarily uh capable of taking on Russia. And I think your military guests on your show have made this very clear over the last uh few months. And the question is why is it that Europe's leaders, political leaders who are in charge of committing Europe able to make this choice on behalf of their pop their whole nations uh in in the face of the public's uh voters saying you know we we want Europe to stand up for itself to be more nationalistic. We want and if the uh social democratic and Christian parties are uh the pro-war military pol parties that are basically accepting our dependence on the United States and are giving up our hopes for growth by trade with Asia, Central Asia, South Asia, North Asia, East Asia, then uh we're we're going to support a nationalistic opposition when there are elections. Well, unfortunately, there are no full uh national elections coming up either for Germany or for France shortly or for England. Uh and so you you see the problem that uh Europe is stuck with a client a US client leadership, not not its its own leadership. And this uh uh US- centered leadership is backed by a US- centered uh neoliberal mass media. Uh the press uh the television uh the whole uh cont the whole uh narrative of economic development is uh is twisted in Europe. They actually think that you Ukraine has a chance to win according to Starmer and Merittz and uh uh Macron. Uh and there's no chance of it winning. They think that the war is somehow leading to a Russian collapse. But Russia's self-sufficient. There's no way that Russia can collapse from uh uh foreign sanctions anymore than China or its allies can collapse from American sanctions because they're self-sufficient. Europe had this self-sufficiency before. It's given it all up in exchange for dependency, not realizing that uh the cost of dependency. when you have an American leader such as Donald Trump uh acting on behalf of American uh large businesses and monopolies and most of all the military-industrial complex uh is going to make demands that basically bankrupt Europe and reverse its uh GDP growth re uh reverse its living standards and impose austerity on it. Well, the problem though is that when uh political leadership doesn't pursue its basic economic national interests such and subordinate itself in the way the Europeans are, you would expect a vacuum to emerge that is uh uh being filled by actors who would actually pursue national interest. uh and uh this is the problem because if you have leaders subordinating themselves they might actually end up killing democracy as well because they will want to seek to prevent that vacuum to be filled by people actually respond to public interest. So in uh Germany you have if there which is now the most popular political party and they want to restore the peace with Russia but uh you know they label them an extremist organization they discussing banning it uh in in France I guess the closest you would have would be Le Pen but yeah she's been she was arrested you have as everyone knows the the presidential election in Romania went the wrong way so they just cancelled the result and uh I was reading Politico today actually and having now election in uh in the Czech Republic and they might get a new prime minister but uh Andre Bobby is the one who is leading the polls. Uh they might block him from being allowed allowed to be prime minister because and political sites one of the two major reason is he has an ambiguous relationship with NATO. He's not cally supportive. I mean this is uh but but what we did is this to Ukraine too when when Sinsky won on that peace platform back in 2019 which 73% of Ukrainians voted for um many of the NATO countries they financed NOS's which drew a red line and uh essentially threatened Sinsky to abandon this idea because uh he wasn't allowed to talk peace with Russia without having NATO in the room. So you have this uh uh I I mean when you have a political elite which doesn't pursue national interest and they prevent anyone from filling the vacuum left behind by their incompetence, you're going to kill democracy at some point though. Uh that's what has happened not only regarding Russia but regarding Israel. If if you make the claim uh that you're against Nazism, if you make the claim that you're against treating any national ethnic religion as being physically subhuman and a different species, uh if you say that there everybody's a human being, we're the same species. You can't have genocide. That's a crime in Germany because uh you're saying that the Palestinians are human beings. That's a crime. if uh in in Germany because uh the Palestinians uh well I don't have to explain that uh if in uh if you say in Ukraine that uh the Slav Slavs the Russian speakers are not subhumans that's uh that's a a crime. You're having a resurgence of Nazis Nazism sweeping across Europe centered in Germany as it was before. And the result is that all of Europe is joined with Germany to say let's refight World War II in the belief that they can win this time this time. And I think part of this illusion is a whole generation of Europeans has grown up not only on American movies but on a false idea of what World War II uh who who fought World War II. The main the two main fighters of World War II was Russia that lost 22 million people and China that lost 18 million people. This is far more that than u the uh the westerners uh the Europeans and American loss lost and uh it was the fight it was the Russians who broke the Vermont strength and it was China that broke Japan's uh strength that began in 1931 with Japan's uh takeover of Manuria. uh the Europeans imagined that somehow they or really the Americans won World War II and uh all the Americans did was pretty much put them on rations. It's it uh uh it charged for the effort. Uh and it it it they came in at the end. Uh they they very quickly ended uh World War II in Japan by using the atom bomb in Japan before the Russians had a chance to drive the Japanese out and uh lead to a uh communist uh domination of Japan and uh they the same thing happened in uh uh in in Western Europe. The Americans delayed and delayed and delayed. The Americans wanted the European war to continue as long as it could, as long as it was killing Russians and Japanese. And the Europeans went along with this. This is how the Russian histories see the war. It's how the Chinese histories see the war. That's not how the Europeans see the war. They think, well, we beat Russia before with American help. We can do it again with American help. in this way just as we carved up uh the Near East uh after World War II and Africa uh between uh France, Germany, France, England uh and the United States uh we can do it all again. This is there's this myth uh of that has somehow created a false narrative guiding how Europeans think about what they can achieve in the future. And it's a false narrative that is almost suicidally selfdeceptive. Well, uh on on that fact and it has to be stressed as a fact that the uh Russians and the Chinese or more correctly the Soviets and the Chinese were the ones who uh yeah did a heavy burden carried the heavy burden in terms of defeating fascism. But recently you have the Kayakalas the EU foreign policy chief mocking it saying oh this uh Chinese and Russians they're claiming that they defeat fascism. Oh, they don't read books over there. Like, we know that uh I'm not sure, you know, I think she watches a lot of movies perhaps as well, thinking maybe World War II was won by Tom Hanks. I'm not sure where her information comes from, but she even mocked the idea in front of camera that this was the case. There's a different set of books. There's one set of books for the majority of the world population. The German history books and the French history books and the American the English history books have all been rewritten from uh in a more and more extreme distortion of uh what actually happened. But there was uh there's been um polls over the decades since World War II from France and other countries where they ask you know who is who was most um who was who cared the greatest well who more or less did the most to liberate France and save Europe from from fascism and immediately after World War II in France I think it's like 85 90% who said well obviously it was the Soviets and then you see through the decades of powerful propaganda and it ends up now the most recent one with a tiny minority. I think it's like 18 or 21% who believed it's uh the Soviet Union who did the most to defeat Nazi Germany. So propaganda works. You just tell the same stories over and over again and after a while people buy it. And uh now we're told that uh well World War II was actually caused by both uh the fascist and the Soviet Union and it was the freedom loving states of the west that beat fascism. I mean it's it's quite an extraordinary tale. Well that's a false way of framing it. You was Europe saved from fascism? The if you look at Europe today it was not saved from fascism. If Europe was saved for fa uh the it was fascism was rescued by the United States almost immediately. The United States immediately hired the main na uh Nazi bureaucracy uh and put them to work fighting the the left wing. You had operation cladio in Italy. You have the terrorism organized by the CIA and uh American foreign policy uh and the support of f uh immediately the United States hired uh the Ukrainian fascists, the Nazis to organize Ukrainian nationalist movement. Uh the United States saved fascism from being defeated by Europe. uh and uh fascism was America's response to socialism and a workingclass movement. It was that Aldo Mororrow was killed in Italy. European politicians were killed just as Leamumba was killed in uh in Africa and other uh Penino Penino killed uh Alende in Chile. Uh you had political assassination. You have an whole extension through the America's National Endowment for Democracy of uh non-governmental organizations that have acted as funding processes to bring what you can only call fascist leaders to Europe. Mer is a fascist. Uh there's no other word for it. And you can uh you could say the same as Kellis. You could same say the same as uh Vanderlayan with her uh Nazi background as uh uh family. Uh was your saved for fascism? And if so, why is there a resurgence of fascism today of supporting uh ethnic genocide uh in uh countries that uh the United States declares uh as necessary for its control of various regions uh of the world? Uh it's this is really the fight. uh you you you're quite right in pointing to the clap the crackdown of uh civil rights of free speech that fascism. you're seeing the same kind of takeover uh in the United States in the last uh week or so just by Donald Trump or uh or imposing a new epoch of McCarthyism like the 1950s of uh attacking uh what he calls the left as if somehow the left uh was in charge of uh assassinating Charlie Kirk. uh that's uh you're having something political political occur in from Europe to the United States that I don't think anyone at the end of World War II in the whole optimism of believing that because they defeated Germany and Italy they'd uh defeated fascism. The fact is that uh the this brought back the class war between um American dominance and oligarchy and socialism to make it to put it labels on it. And uh that that fight is has gone on. There's still been a fight against uh socialism and against democracy. Uh the movement of Europe has not been towards democracy. It's been away from it. it's been uh towards uh dependent on an increasingly undemocratic uh imperialism and even dictatorship by uh US neocons and neoliberals that are trying to push for a refight of World War II against Russia and China this time and uh uh just as they won uh were able to end up defeating uh fascism whether it's German or Japanese in World War II. Uh the same thing would happen today, but the fight is going to be much more violent and fought by missiles, not by uh infantries. Yeah, there's um yeah, the idea that uh that the the US wouldn't have worked or supported uh you know fascist that this was only an antascist alliance is kind of interesting because I just looked it up here um a quote by Harry Truman uh before he took the presidency though he he said uh here is if if we see that Germany is winning we ought to help Russia and if Russia is winning we ought to help Germany. in that way let them kill as many as possible. And uh towards the end of the of the second world war, we also had the British who then developed this uh plan called Operation Unthinkable uh developed in May of 1945 when the war was coming to an end which entailed not just the US and Britain but also using what remained of the fascist army uh to attack do a surprise attack on the Soviet Union immediately after the common victory. So this uh but you know give this 80 years of Hollywood and uh we have a very different story. Uh I I I did want to shift a bit back towards the the the economic conquest if you will of of allies because we mentioned the Europeans but uh the US also has some I guess loyal allies in East Asia. I'm thinking then uh Korea, Japan and uh Taiwan each of them have also strong well let's call it security dependence on the United States. Uh how how is the US trying to I guess put the squeeze on this uh well two countries and one island let's say. >> Well again uh well the the word security uh dependence is is a euphemism. It's Orwellian double think. Japan has talked about rearming and it's even talking about uh becoming perhaps an atomic power again. If Japan rearms, this is going to immediately lead uh China to uh defend itself. And uh Japan's already met a devastating loss in World War II. There's no way in which Japan can be a milit a real military threat to anyone. Uh certainly the North Koreans like the South Koreans have no love for Japan at all because of its brutal occupation of Korea for so many uh so many generations. Uh there there's almost a hatred of of Japan there. uh Japan by uh the Liberal Democratic Party being installed by the United States by uh America's compact with the Japanese yakuzis, the criminals. Uh the MacArthur uh in Japan and the US State Department uh made deals with the criminals to go and beat up uh attack the socialist demonstrations. there was a a chance of socialism in Japan after World War II, a reaction uh by the Japanese and uh the uh the American uh alternative was to make Japan a uh basically a largely criminalized uh mafiaike uh oligarchy uh controlled by the LDP. Well, the recent uh elections now are for the first time threatening to dethrone the uh pro- US uh Liberal Democratic Party and put in a more nationalist party. All nationalism means it doesn't mean uh Japanese nationalism of the 1930s military style. It means independence from the United States. And the aim is not to put Japan at risk of any kind of war again. Well, again, Japan is host of the uh military uh US military bases and uh in the a few weeks ago, you had China's uh great military demonstration very explicitly showing uh missiles that they pointed out this missile can hit Guam uh uh America's military uh outpost in uh the uh with the was the the the Pacific and uh it can hit the other Japanese uh military outposts. So it's not Japan's risking its security. The same thing u with Taiwan. Uh the the Taiw there's a very heavy Taiwanese investment in mainland China. There already is a kind of economic symbiosis uh between the two countries, but the United States is trying to drive a wedge in that. And the Chinese have said, you know, if for any reason you're able to co-opt the Taiwanese leaders in the way that you've co-opted, say the European leaders, uh we're we're going to, you know, hit down very hard and uh it'll be no contest. Uh your naval fleet is are just sitting ducks. Your naval power that helped win World War II is no longer an active military tool because we can wipe them out in one day in the entire navy. Navies are obsolete as the tool for control that they were for so many centuries when Britain had uh the the greatest navy in the world. And the whole idea of navies uh for Britain was to deal with uh uh sea coast uh with uh economic development around the sea coast and that was because Britain was promoting foreign trade and inter commercial interdependence among countries. Well, you have China has uh tried to counteract this whole Mckenderlake strategy of controlling the periphery of continents by trade. Uh China is developing internal connections through the built and road uh initiative with uh railways, pipelines, highways, all sorts of interconnections. So the whole uh uh vehicles of foreign trade are now becoming more inland and domestic. What that does is create domestic regional spheres of influence and self-dependency to become independent. The effect of the United States demands that it's made on everyone from Europe to Asia to Latin America are so overreaching that they've uh created a reaction against the whole last two centuries of uh liberalism that saw foreign trade and interconnections is a uh an I won't say a rules-based order uh but a uh an economic order of stability. Uh you have these interconnections now being weaponized. Trump has weaponized foreign trade, both foreign trade, foreign access to the US market for European and other exporters and uh the ability to uh import basic needs that the United States controls headed by oil and also agriculture and now by high technology uh electronics. uh trying to create trying to weaponize all this trade to create a form of dependency that the United States can use as a demand. We will destabilize your economy if uh you don't give into our demands. And the real reason to going back to your first question again, why is the United States treating Europe that way and trying to treat the BRICS countries the same way? That's because the United States is no longer industrialized. It's de-industrialized. It's mainly it's made all this growth of wealth since uh 2008 the uh the junk mortgage crisis has been in the stock bond and real estate markets. It's financial wealth. It's not the wealth of real production. It's not the wealth of living standards. Living standards have not risen for more than half of Americans since 2008. It's all been so concentrated in the wealthiest 10% that the wealthiest 10% of Americans are responsible for 50% of all the growth in consumption uh goods. Uh but of course the consumption goods of the wealthy uh wealthiest 10% are not the same kind of consumer goods that the bottom 90% uh by food and basic uh basic needs. They're they're luxuries, their Andy Warhol uh etchings and uh their trophies and uh Italian fashions. All of this was no way back in the 17th century uh 18th century. All of all of this was being uh uh debated and realizing that the financial sector does not really uh behave like an industrial sector and uh that we're we're we're seeing a whole transformation in the dynamics of what capitalism is all about, what economies are all about. Well, you and I have talked about that before. And uh all of that has a political dimension. And the political dimension means that if America is to avoid an even deeper squeeze on its living standards today, it has to get support from other countries to uh get from them the wealth and the imports and the money and the subsidies to keep its economy going. that its domestic economy no longer can provide. So, the United States has lost its own ability to be self-sufficient and its response to Europe is to destroy Europe's ability to be economically and commercially and financially self-sufficient. Well, the bricks uh Asia uh now in conjunction with the global south uh Africa, parts of Latin America are uh are in putting their own self-sufficiency as a chief economic aim so that they will not become uh subject to uh the US bro beating and extortion and uh the the the threats of disrupting their economies. If you insulate your economy from the United States, there's nothing it can do uh to you to impose sanctions or to uh raise tariffs or to uh weaponize its uh import and export trade and financial trade. Well, like this is why yeah the whole um USled alliance systems has changed so fundamental because after World War II the United States uh actually had some extremely generous trade agreement with frontline states a bit uh yeah the Germany or uh yeah well all Europeans for that sake or South Korea, Taiwan, Japan. So it's um it's just in this era the all countries are now faced with a dilemma as the US is seeking to extract concessions. uh that is either they fall into the demands but by doing so of course they have to sever themselves off from other countries um and then isolate themselves more make themselves more dependent on the US or they seek full uh to seek full autonomy by actually diversifying but then they have to lean more into bricks SEO and similar institutions but um there's not that many middle grounds anymore and I think that's uh why the US overreach with India was uh so spectacular because the assumption was they could make Europeans out of them in terms of uh cutting themselves off from all other centers of power subordinating themselves to the US and you signing whatever they put in front of them and it turned out that they had to go the other way but the fact that they had to the Modi had to go to China kind of pointed out from my perspective this dilemma that there's no middle ground anymore either you have to subordinate yourself or you have to protect yourself by diversif ing but then you have to lean into the multipolar institutions. So it's a yeah it's a fascinating time. It's a interesting social experiment as well for that sake. Uh I'm not sure if you have any final thoughts before we wrap up. >> Only the countries that uh America defeated in World War II have turned into uh surrender monkeys. uh Japan has become an abject uh uh victim of the Stockholm syndrome and uh of course Germany uh they they're the two countries that have given in and the other great uh opponent of the United States in World War II was of course Britain and uh the the the British loan of 1944 and the trade agreements that you just mentioned that were favorable to other countries uh were aimed specifically at breaking up the British Empire. They by opening international markets they ended British imperial preference. That meant that all of the foreign exchange the earnings made by India and uh Argentina and other uh global south raw materials exporters were no longer required to be spent within the British Empire but could be spent anywhere. Well, the British the Britain's economy was destroyed and so that meant free to be spent in the United States and the trade agreements that were made uh it's true uh with Germany um European countries of course uh the United States favored the trade there because the European companies were being bought out by American multinational firms and uh what was supported above all in Europe were the international firms and that's exactly what the fight is this week uh between uh uh in the last month uh by Trump uh against England and the EU. Today's Financial Times has a whole wonderful article, Britain must stand up to US pressure on tech rules. And uh this is about the uh the the digital digital services tax of Europe. Europe at least is trying to impose a digital services tax on American technology firms because they don't have they've been able to use Hollywood accounting to avoid having to pay uh income taxes there. And uh the uh uh Trump has said well told England uh Britain if you try to do uh to stand up to us and impose your digital services tax uh on American companies or try to limit what uh my contributors in Silicon Valley uh uh want to do. We're going to raise tariffs on you again no matter what the agreement we made last spring. Well, if he can say it to Britain, he can certainly say it to the EU. uh if the uh he's made it very clear to the EU that if anything the EU does that is at the cost of American firms as long as these multinationals contribute to Trump's Republican campaign and his personal campaign and invest personally in his u cryptocurrency scams and the other scams. He'll uh just uh uh squeeze uh the these tighten the screws on these countries. So that's basically uh uh what's been happening there. I guess that's my final thought. They the Europe has succumbed to uh giving the all of the diplomatic trade, commercial and financial initiative to US uh planners who are not making uh open-ended uh trade and financial agreements that benefit all countries. But as Trump said, the United States has to be the winner in any deal that it's making with foreign countries. And that's why uh the United States is not making international deals anymore. Trump says we're going to make deals on a country bycountry basis. We're going to divide and conquer. It worked for Britain for a couple of centuries. It'll work for us. And as long as we can uh make uh make uh play different countries against each other and it's us uh the US economy versus much smaller individual economies uh they'd rather hang separately. As long as we can make them willing to hang separately instead of hanging together then we've won the diplomatic uh fight for control. Yeah. Well, I think the fault of the flow of the Europeans is that they think they should just wait out Trump as if this is only about Trump. I mean, I think he is quite extreme in uh and uh radical in his approach in terms of recognizing a problem and seeking to solve it. But I don't think the alternatives are well the Bidens of the world would be would necessarily go in a very different direction. Of course it might be a bit milder but the overarching problem isn't I mean we tend to focus on personalities but what is the what is the end stage I mean how else is this the capitalist system being so exhausted what else is it going to do I mean the the US if it can't compete anymore it's losing the technological lead uh it's drowning in debt the massive economic inequality is fueling social and political problem I one sees that this has reached the end of the line, there's no more ways to deal with the coming financial crisis. You can't put the interest rate down or up as either it's going to make uh well collapse the dollar or it's going to make the debt repayment uh unmanageable. So, it is a it is a brick wall it seems. So, I I think uh Trump deals with this in a let's say a very authoritarian way. But the idea that we can just go back to the way things were uh I think this is quite uh yeah delusional. It's uh yeah wishful thinking. >> Well that's the whole problem Glenn. You put your finger on it. The way things were uh the way things were today is not how they were in 1945. There was still an active leftwing in Europe. There was a chance of Europe going uh socialist in a mixed economy. And uh certainly uh the British Labor Party in the 1940s was progressive like that. Uh there was progressive movements throughout Europe. All of that was counteracted by the United States to prevent that. And uh you had the the old European moneyed aristocracy fighting against this uh pushing uh essentially for neoliberalism for a dismantling of government strong enough to regulate uh the uh financial oligarchies that were emerging and making fortunes on a mutual interdependency with American multinational firms and multinational investment. and the the whole world economy was restructured in US centric lines uh that have led to this uh this problem. So there there's uh in order for Europe to uh prosper again, it needs to rethink the whole direction of history. And of course that's what you and I have been talking about for the last few months. And uh they they have to reinvent the economic wheel to analyze how uh do we create a mixed economy that's going to promote growth, rising living standards and industry instead of creating financial fortunes American style that's leading to our de-industrialization just as it's uh led to America's de-industrialization. How do we end up avoiding uh looking like the United States? And what is China doing right in what what it's uh take off that really is following the very policies that made uh Britain and Germany and the United States industrial powers in the late 19th century. Oh well that's a interesting part when they the way that China's capitalism is defined as managed capitalism all these uh strange words which uh but if you look at it it's very very similar to the industrial capitalism of the US itself in the 19th century but uh uh yes uh Michael Hudson as always uh thank you so much for sharing your insights and uh uh yeah we'll uh leave a link link to your blog in the description as well and uh I can't recommend your books enough to the listeners. So, uh thank you again. Thank you very much, Glenn, for the compliments.
