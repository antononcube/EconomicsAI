president Trump has appointed Vice
President Vance to remove from the
Smithsonian Institute the
anti-american
improper
ideology what is that it's over the
empire is on its way down in that moment
Donald Trump says "I'm going to take
back the Panama Canal i'm going to take
Greenland away from Denmark i'm going to
take Canada away from the Canadian when
your country is falling apart one of the
ways you hold it together is to go on a
crusade and the working class is hit in
too many ways it's upset it's angry it
doesn't see a way out that's a
description of the German working class
that's why it went with
Hitler today I would like to talk about
the decline of the American Empire this
is a a very provocative question uh but
first I want to say whether you love
Trump or hate Trump that this more
applies to people who hate Trump i think
it's just absolutely ridiculous to say
that he's Hitler or he's as bad as
Hitler when you look at what Hitler did
versus what Trump has done it's just
crazy agreed i still think it's a very
interesting historical exercise to ask
what parallels you see between Trump and
Hitler as people maybe in their rises to
power their regimes that's not the kind
of reasoning I do it's
just I don't believe in it it makes no
sense to me what what's
interesting is not these
individuals neither of them because
Trump is irrelevant as we we spoke about
before yeah it's the
situation he what he does is made by his
circumstances not by him he is really
the the the in a long chain of causation
he's the last step he's not the first
step he's not even in the middle he's
trying to cope with 27 pressures coming
at him in different ways and if I knew
more about him I might make an educated
guess which way he's going to
go but I don't I'm not about to know him
i don't even care very much i'm
interested in the forces and and how
they are pushing him which way he
finally
goes I can't know and the it's kind of
idle speculation the reason the German
story is important is it gives you some
sense of some of the pressures he's
under you've got a working class here
that is very shocked very no one
prepared them that's a flaw of this
culture which of course no one is
allowed to say no one prepared them that
there is an empire that the empire is
going to decline
why because every empire in the world
has and do you really want to bet that
this one
won't and if it
might could it be now could we we can't
we cannot have that conversation we just
had a presidential election in which
neither candidate said a word like that
not Trump not Biden not Harris not
declining empire us who me not at
all they all talk as though we're
deciding on doing the we're the United
States and we're making decisions in
union look at Mr trump mr trump in a
world in which probably it is fair to
say the overwhelming majority of people
are coming out of a century or two of
colonialism hating it wanting it to
disappear
anti-colonialism
anti-imperialism is the ethos of the
world at this point why would a leader
now given the ethos I just
described having
attacked Russia for three years
relentlessly for taking Ukraine
territory in Ukraine suddenly become the
advocate of taking territory
what the hell
what but now wait a minute now you do
but you do have an answer when your
country is falling
apart one of the ways you hold it
together is to go on a
crusade hitler attacks
everybody it's crazy how is Germany
going to fight Russia Poland the West
what are you nuts yeah yeah afterwards
that's how we talk but at the time he's
solving
problems step by step he's and his
rationale is kind of un if you look at
it honestly I don't like it we're
obviously you know most of my family was
killed by the fellow you not his part
but I understand what he was doing i
understand what Mr trump is doing i
think the usefulness of the exercise is
to learn something from understanding it
to be more strategically adept at
avoiding the worst outcome hitler you
know Trump is no Hitler i got that i I
agree with you about that but he's under
pressures that in one case led in that
direction and there are sure as hell
signs that in this case there are also
some of them leading in that direction
will they be strong enough will they
engender a counter reaction who knows
germany at the time Hitler takes power
had extremely
wellorganized very powerful leftwing
half the country were in the socialist
or communist parties these were parties
that had armed detachments to fight in
the streets and so and they were
disciplined in many ways particularly
the communist party of German we our
left is out to lunch there are no
organizations even remotely comp
comparable is it is it therefore easier
for fascism to come here in some ways
you bet you
bet if and when Mr trump if he hadn't
done it yet but if and when Mr trump
were to mobilize his partisans you know
the Proud Boys folks like that put you
put them in a uniform the way that
Hitler did and have them terrorize
anybody who has a
meeting to get rid of the unamerican
improper
ideology now it's a Smithsonian tomorrow
it'll be what a rally in Time Square we
already are picking up people whose
crime seems to have been that they
participated in anti-Israel or pro
Palestinian activities at various
universities the universities are
caving giving the names to the police
abetting the whole process colombia
beyond words
okay those are signs and I think it is
as it is as inappropriate to equate
Hitler to Trump as it is not to see that
Trump is under very similar pressures
and is making some similar moves that's
as much as it's reasonable to say but
it's unreasonable to deny that i I wish
it weren't the case
secretary of State Rubio made a speech
yesterday in which he proud he he made
it clear I'm
boasting 300 foreign students that was a
number he gave have been expelled from
the United States have had their visas
canled or
withdrawn people in the middle of their
PhD studying such revolutionary topics
as you know oceanography and so forth
well but it turns out that they wrote an
article about genocide in Gaza or
something like that jesus it's
interesting it's interesting that people
who come here and participate in
nonviolent perfectly legal political
expression which is not an excluded
activity by anybody are now being a and
that nothing is happening nothing is
happening very few people saying much
about it the the the Democratic party is
DOA it's not I mean it's not even there
mr biden seems to vanished into thin air
kla Harris with him you
know this is the great for me by the way
you're you're heading into the greatest
crisis that the Democratic Party has had
in a long time the progressive wing of
that
party it cannot continue much longer the
way it has and
that's you know they may not recover I
can't tell you the number of people that
have contacted me talking about new
parties third party I mean you know it's
off the ch that doesn't prove or
guarantee anything but it is an
interesting phenomena coming out of this
situation and even the republican party
may not be able to you can see senators
already over this uh what are they
calling it signal gate uh are are
beginning to split inside the
Republicans because those who see this
as another Watergate and they want to
get on the right side early and those
who don't want
to
but here's the punch line take us back
these are all signs of a declining
empire that's all of this all of this
Trump as a
phenomena this is this is a
society that somewhere in some way
understands that
the convenient
oscillation of the last 70 years a
Democrat a
Republican as president you do your
stint and you turn it over to the other
one and the same at the Senate and the
same at the House and in uh and it
doesn't make all that much difference
it's enough of a difference of little
that half the people don't bother voting
they don't see any point in it they
don't regret it when they don't vote
because we know two years later four
years later they don't vote again
all right these are This was a very The
Germans have a wonderful word gimmutish
i don't know how that translates into
English gamutish
um
pleasant
comfortable
relaxed tranquil words like that
uh Mr trump is the end of that mr trump
had nothing he didn't come up through
the ranks he didn't learn the political
game he wasn't like so many of you you
know look at Kla Harris she was a DA she
was a senator she learns
uh Biden he was a senator from Delaware
you know in Bush's world that Mr trump
comes out of what's what's his skill
he's good at being a playboy in New York
City going to clubs with his father's
money you're charming it's fine who car
but you need And he's brash and he says
things you're not supposed to and he
acts he he doesn't fit that's why he get
treated badly and now he's angry and
getting back and revenge against all
it's a play shakespeare could have
written this you know it's a play it's
the odd president but that tells you
something and that is that the system
can't it can't go
on that's why when he first starts he
rides down an escalator and tells us all
how Mexicans are rapists well that's no
politician would do that that's
nuts but it was the ticket to
success because everything is different
now and being your
reasonable
Bush Clinton is you know the same same
old same old doesn't fly doesn't fly and
by the way I can assure you since I'm
closer to the Democratic party than I am
of course to the
Republican is that among the Democrats
that I talk
to they
are they are more troubled than I've
ever seen them they don't know what to
do and I I know people pretty high up in
that structure they really don't know
what to
do they know that Bernie is kind of out
of the pig he's too old but they're
coming up lots of them all over the
place and and they understand that if
you look at the voting if you look at
the young people
particularly this has got to go and
especially
now if you look at the economic program
that
Mr trump is putting
forward it's nuts that you can't I
mean I liken it to this and by now you
have a sense of how my head
reasons the best image for Mr trump's
economic
policy is from
football you know what a Hail Mary
passes that's his pol his policy is a
Hail Mary it's when the game is nearly
lost
and you've got only enough seconds for
one more play so you tell your
receivers I want you all to go out and
go over in the left hand corner of the
field you know close to the end zone but
not yet i'm going to heave the ball
there there's going to be three of you
and three defenders and you're all going
to go for the ball it's going to bounce
around and hopefully it'll come down in
your hands and then we win the game you
fall into the end zone we're done that's
it that's where we are why is this his
economic policy because nothing else
left for him let's start with tariffs
right tariffs is the number one weapon
that he's deploying
tariffs have been in
existence for hundreds of years the
United States has used tariffs at
various points in its history since it
was independent and could do so so right
after the revolutionary war we had the
power to do and we have on occasion done
tariffs okay number one number
two some tariffs were worked out in
deals with the rest of the world
uh and have not occasioned a problem
because we
gave
stuff that we could
also benefit from i'll give you an
example in the
1960s there was a a really serious
struggle when the United States wanted
to levy
tariffs on foreign
automobiles why
because coming out of World War II the
rebuilding of the German and Japanese
economies from World War II
destruction led both countries to the
same strategy
the best way we can recover from the
war is to outdo the number one dominant
economy in the world the United
States and its number one industry at
that time
automobiles if we can't do that they're
going to dominate
forever that's our task that's our goal
that's our measure of success
can we produce a better car at a lower
price
enter
Volkswagen by the way Hitler's project
volkswagen volkswagen in German means
the people's
car
um Toyota yeah you know them you know
the Japanese we all know them now
they started to come in there was the
romance of the VW Beetle the little
round
one
and the auto companies went crazy
detroit which was our auto center at
that time was the
dominant success story of American
capitalism when foreign dignitaries came
to Washington the president would fly
with them to Detroit to have them look
at Dearbornne or look at the the Ford
plant or the GM plant or the Chrysler
plant look here we have look at this
technology look at the workers how
satisfied they are look we got a
significant number of black workers here
see we're overcoming our racial it was
half but half
genuine you know
justified and there was a horror our
dominance would be undone because the VW
was a better car at a cheaper price and
the the Japanese came shortly
thereafter and so a deal was
struck
here's we're going to put a tariff
But we won't put it on every
car and we'll put it low on regular cars
but you got to give us one thing we're
going to put a fat tariff and in
exchange you can put a tariff on some of
our agricultural
products the Europeans were interested
in
preserving their agriculture
particularly their chicken production
and Americans are good at making chicken
the chicken is no good but the cheap
price is
spectacular um anyway long story short a
tariff was attached to the pickup truck
a big one
25% compared to all the a sedan 2 and
a2% that tariff has been in effect for
half a century you know why Americans
celebrate the pickup truck
why every He-Man has a pickup truck
because it's a symbol of
masculinity not at
all you had to train the American
buffoon to want that truck you know why
cuz the profit margin on the truck is
way better than the profit margin on a
car and why because of the
tariff no far that's why you don't see
very many foreign the pickup truck that
has the name Toyota that was made here
to escape the tariff you know it's just
so there's nothing new about
it and therefore there's a literature
you know many more books than you have
on your shelf here about tariffs it's
been a it it's a a segment of every
course in international trade ever
taught and I've taught
them the library is full of enormous
studies of every tariff there's ever
been studies did it work did it fail why
did it work why did it fail and here's
the conclusion i'll save you a lot of
time i have done the literature i've
taught the course we don't know is the
answer the effect of a tariff depends on
the context within which it's said it's
a little bit like the phrase "Oh shit."
The impact of saying oh loudly in a
group of people depends on that group
who they are what they're used to
they'll either be horrified or they'll
give it no notice right
depends that's what a tariff is so when
the president says "I'm going to tariff
it's going to have this
result," you're talking to a
somebody who's talking right out of the
other end because he has no idea what
he's talking about what will be the
effect of the tariff on Canada i don't
know and I know he doesn't
know right it could be there's the Hail
Mary could it get him the result he's
hoping for yeah when the quarterback
heaves the Hail Mary pass could it be
end up caught by his tight end possible
possible Mr trump's policy if he's
luckier than I don't know who could work
out but as a policy with his you know
bravado explaining
that this it's so pathetically absurd
that you don't people like us and I'm
I'm you don't have to be a leftist to
understand it any half-wit trained
economist knows you this is this is
first year
economic class in college stuff right he
either didn't have it or he's forgotten
that you can't do this and so I'm here
to tell you that the consequences of the
tariff could
be a serious boost to inflation here
because remember a tariff means stuff
coming into the country costs more right
uh uh a bag of coffee coming in from
Latin America or from Mexico for
example cost $100 let's say he's going
to put a
$25 25% tariff you're going to have to
pay $100 to get the co the the bag of
coffee plus $25 to Uncle Sam that's the
tariff it's a tax mr trump often says
that the tariff is paid by the other
country this is wrong it's not paid by
the other country it's paid by Americans
nobody else is built united States can't
bill another country for a tax it's not
the way the system works you know
Nigeria cannot bill us for taxes their
legislature passes it's not the way it
works okay so now the coffee will cost
to the American buyer
$125 let's say the American buyer is a
company called Starbucks they now have
to pay 25% more for their single most
important input you know what's going to
happen to the price of your
latte the inflation is going to get
major worse
multiply it by not just coffee but by
all the other items our biggest trading
partners are Mexico and Canada the two
countries hit with 25% tariff those are
the biggest sources of inputs imports
into the United States so you could have
here a sudden
shock the avocado toast that the nice
people like to eat that's going to cost
a fortune and the avocados all come from
Mexico in the morning you have coffee
which I just told you will go up in
price and into it you put sugar which is
an imported product don't you
go "Welcome to America of $20 for your
morning
coffee." You think the working class is
angry now oh
wait mr trump won the election in part
by the antipathy towards the Democrats
held accountable for the inflation that
we had during the Biden
presidency mr trump really want to do
that now making himself to blame cuz
everybody's going to say it's because of
the tariffs and it'll be largely true
and then we ask the question what will
the objects the people hurt and the
Mexicans you know and let me do Mexico
cuz it's it's wonderful it's so horrible
it's
wonderful we are deporting into Mexico
more than any other country millions of
undocumenteds that are being collected
by ICE and sent over the border into
Mexico what's in Mexico for them nothing
there are no jobs in
Mexico not for millions of people
suddenly arriving this is a
catastrophe but we're just
beginning those millions who were
working here in the United States the
millions of Mexicans all around us they
were taking a portion of their weekly
salary and sending it back to Mexico for
their grandma and their grandpa and
their children that they left behind
this was and I know the numbers
18% of the GDP if I'm not
mistaken a
huge cash inflow to the Mexican economy
gone you return the workers who for whom
there's no work and you cut off the
source of
income and now you're saying "But you
can't export anything to America anymore
because we got a tariff against you." A
lot of people aren't going to buy $125
bag of coffee because they'll turn to
tea they're not going to What is Mexico
going to do where is Mexico and in
Canada it it's different canada sells us
lumber we're going to put a 25% You know
what nobody can afford to build houses
in America now add 25% to the cost of
lumber kiss it goodbye
and rents will
go
what half of this country uses
electricity from Canada the Midwest
brings Canadian electricity because
Canada has oil gas and can generate
masses of it what do what is Canada
going to do with its lumber with its Oh
I know there is a place that will buy
all the electricity and all the lumber
it's called the People's Republic of
China having a real competitor for the
first time means everybody has options
they never had
before so you the real effect of Mr
trump's policies of tra of of and I
haven't even gone through the impact on
China or the impact on Europe and he's
throwing tariffs on them
too you could have a a
concatenation of events in which what
the unthought through strategy of Mr
trump doesn't yet take into account that
there's another
competitor who can buy if you don't who
can sell if you don't you're not what
you were in the latter half of the 20th
century it all made a kind of sense
united States says jump and everybody
asks how high but we're not there it's
over the empire is on its way down you
can live with that you can make that
decline
manageable you can avoid a trauma or you
cannot for every example of an empire
that went down traumatically I can give
you one that didn't and vice versa
that's a choice we have if we take it
seriously which our leaders do not so
they're doing this m the
retaliation i
mean Canadians are on mass changing
their summer vacation plans to not come
to the United States
it's an interesting moment why they're
so shaken by all the rhetoric and
everything but that that hurts our
tourist industry which is a significant
industry in this country you know six
Canadians were were planning normally to
come to that resort or to to be part of
the sunbirds that come to Florida in the
winter but they're not coming anymore
you know and those people in Florida
with their you see did you see what Mr
dantis did this is another he's the
governor of Florida he gave a speech
four days
ago in which he said "Well we got a
problem here we're
deporting
immigrants but they're the ones who pick
the fruits and vegetables upon which the
Florida economy
depends but I have a solution
we're changing the law so children can
go to work in the
fields that's the end of an empire
that's what
happens and no one says
boo 14y olds will now be
eligible to work until I think 9 at
night i mean all kinds of things that
the law forbade for children before
we're going to have child
labor and it's going to be good because
you see you can pay the children as
little as you got away with paying those
immigrants jesus Christ how many
symptoms do you want to see before you
go to the doctor
how many things are you going to
face before you realize you got a
different problem than the one you
thought you
had and all of this this
this let me put it to you this way
i if everything
is going your way you can afford to make
mistakes misjudgments you know because
everything is kind of going your way so
yeah you forgot to take care of that but
that that's happening and that's good
and that'll kind of compensate for the
boo boo you made for the mistaken judge
and the problem is that that's true that
is true and the United States had that
for the second half of the 20th
century but now the wind is going the
other way everything going down there's
no there's no slack anymore there's no
space each mistake now worsens the other
one i'll give the a very concrete
example when the United
States
decided to fight against the Russians
uh about
Ukraine
right it was quickly
understood even before the war started
that Russia
has if not the greatest nuclear weapons
in the world second to the United States
and not a distant second if it's at all
second which
means nuclear war is out you couldn't
possibly pick a worse choice than Russia
to have a nuclear war with i mean pick
any China pick anybody you know Russia's
got the most so there's not going to be
a nuclear war the two sides understand
that would be crazy neither of them
cares enough about Ukraine to run such a
risk okay what does that mean well it
means that there if there's going to be
a
war it's a conventional war army Navy
Air Force human war okay but then you
don't want to fight
Russia because Russia has a fantastic
record in these kinds of wars i mean uh
Napoleon tried and got defeated
and Kaiser Wilhelm tried and got
defeated and Adolf Hitler tried and got
the you do you really want to fight the
Russians in an armed conventional war
the United States understood that they
really did so they came up with the
great way of victory
sanctions russia is a small economic
unit russia's dependent on exporting oil
and
gas we are the United States and we have
allies the Europeans and we're going to
say to the Russians we're going to
sanction you they did this is the quote
i'm quoting i didn't make these things
up mother of all
sanctions it's what they called it we're
hitting you with this and then we're
sanctioning oligarchs we're sanctioning
industries we're sanctioning companies
we're sanctioning the whole country
we're sanctioning sanctioning
sanctioning and it was the biggest
program of sanctions there are thousands
of sanctions right now on the on
Russia but the big one was Europe would
stop buying and to drive the point the
oil and gas and to drive the point home
remember they blew up the undersea
uh cable the undersea gas pipeline right
i mean extraordinary action to stop the
Russians from exporting their number one
money maker that was going to bring them
to their knees the president said so
what wasn't calculated was that the
Russians have a way to avoid the impact
of the sanctions not the usual way
because sanctions are quite easy to
evade there's a book I forget the
author's name but there's a book a few
years old which is a study of sanctions
and the whole point of the book is to
show you done by some academic professor
somewhere in the United States here the
whole point of the book is to show you
that the sanctions never work country
after country he goes to it's very good
very good announcement anyway it's not
that the mistake made by uh Biden and
his
people was not to understand the
importance of China and its allies known
as the bricks you know Belgium uh Brazil
Russia India China and South Africa and
the dozen other countries that are now
part of that uh what Russia did is say
okay I don't have to sell it to you I'm
going to sell it to India and China end
of you lose I got my money is coming in
I'm sell Here's the joke when you sell
it to
India it just goes on another ship and
goes right back to Europe Russia is
still selling its oil to Europe it's
just
just a new middleman But the beauty they
never understood because they didn't
understand they didn't understand that
if you don't handle
intellectually the re change in the
world you're going to make
catastrophic strategic
mistakes they lost the war in Ukraine
russia now occupies a quarter of that
country they lost because the sanctions
didn't work and it didn't work because
you didn't
understand what this new configuration
of the world economy is so your
sanctions aren't going to work they're
not going to work for five minutes they
don't even have to sneak around they got
these two monster countries china and
the bricks is 55 I believe percent of
the world's people united States has 4
and a half% of the world's people you
can't overcome that that's just light
you know that's light and day or
whatever it's
just you got to face this you can't
pretend you are not in the 1960s and 70s
you're just
not but we live in a country of uh as my
psychotherapist wife says
denial and what we got is a country and
a and a leadership
that is committed deep down to denial
it's like watching the Europeans now
they couldn't defeat the Russians with
the Americans backing them up the
Americans have now pulled
out and they're babbling to one another
how they're going to do it that's a joke
not even a good one that's a joke that's
so pathetic it's painful it's
embarrassing to watch
you talk kier Starmer a relatively new
prime minister in England is wanting to
send troops to Ukraine you want to go
down in history with as the shortest
prime minister ever you do that you
idiot what what what is it yeah these
are not stupid people i don't mean idiot
in that way it's just this is an idiotic
it's like the Hail Mary pass we can do
better than that we are not in the last
two seconds we are not Don't do that
don't do There's no need for this but
nobody asked that question everybody's
enthralled with going to hit him with a
tariff and I'm going to raise a tariff
and he yesterday he did yet another
unbelievably crazy
thing you know about Tik Tok you know
Tik Tok is Chinese and Mr trump has said
he won't tolerate them being Chinese
which is a topic in and of itself but
let's leave that and the the deadline
for them to stop being Chinese is the
5th of April which is coming
up and they but they haven't cut a deal
yet the
Chinese the hope was that American
company would come in and get them for a
cheap price because they're under the
gun they have to sell chinese are very
they're used to this they much smarter
than that so there's no deal yet and
there may not be
one and Mr trump begins to realize he's
at the wrong end of this because if the
Chinese are
smart they'll kill tick
tock and they'll say to the 20 million
Americans who use it you know who
deprived you of your Tik Tok the orange
man
someone told him yesterday or the day
before you're going to screw yourself
here Donald you're going to they're
going to go out they'll reset it and
call it lick lock two weeks later and
the and and and it'll have all the names
they'll have all they have everything
they need they'll just move them and the
whole game will start all over again or
they'll find an intermediary you know
some obscure Norwegian company and make
them the intermediate all of this is
being done I'm sure all taken care
you're gonna get screwed Donald so yeah
four days ago Donald goes on the T on
the air and
says the only thing he could
say I am I'm not going to impose the
April 5th deadline
if a deal can be worked out though in
the the days and weeks
following I might take the tariffs off
of
China do you
understand what he's teaching everybody
even though it'll take him a long time
to
learn is that this is all a game real
fast and loose yeah and I'm playing as
fast and loose as I know how i realize
oh this is going to come back and
bite me i got to do something so what
what can I give the Chinese to back away
from doing what they're going to about
to do to me because more important for
the Chinese than Tik Tok no matter how
many billions it's worth is destroying
the political base of Mr trump by
depriving Americans of Tik Tok and
blaming him for it which they will be
able to
do wow now he didn't think that
through just like he didn't think
through the how sanctions could not work
in the Ukraine situation he
didn't the only other
explanation
besides the chaos of all this is if
there's a method in the madness if
there's some strategic
objective and I have heard one I don't I
don't buy
it but I might be wrong and maybe it's
true i'll tell you that if you
want that he is in
fact the prisoner of Mr putin
and that somehow making a mess
here is the
point if it were the objective to do
that he's he's doing it
you think that I don't I don't believe
that that's correct i don't agree with
that but I've heard it and I look it's
like everything else it's a symptom to
hear it whether it's true or not and I
don't think it is i certainly don't know
that it is uh but that people are
thinking that it's thoughtful it's it's
it's the intellectual effort to say this
is so bizarre and
unusual that I need to think why would
this be h Don't get caught in the weeds
why is the
totality an awful lot of Americans pick
up the newspaper waiting each day for
what Mr trump is going to say that's
sort of outrageous or extreme or
provocative and what what is that could
be his personal style yeah okay even
then if you believe that why are we
having that now we haven't had that for
a long time if ever but what what what
is
this
so I'm sure people will come up with
more and less
far-fetched because the situation is
far-fetched i don't blame people for
coming up with these sorts of
speculations because you it is
provocative you want to understand it i
want to I wish I had an expert if you
say to me why is this whole thing happen
well I tell you my story of a declining
empire i think that does a good bit of
putting these things together into a
coherent argument so I use it makes
sense to me i don't do the Putin story
that's American you know demonization of
your enemies and all of that i mean it's
not that I like Mr putin has nothing to
do with that but I'm looking for
explanations uh when people offer one I
listen
one of the amazing things though that
comes out of these interviews is the
tangents are often gems and I can't
resist one other one before we get back
to the other stuff and it's that and and
I think it's actually could be relevant
to the discussion at hand and we've
never spoken about Hitler on the show
and I think it would be interesting to
hear uh given the current environment
maybe in the background if there is a a
simple story because obviously it's a
complicated thing but how it was that
Hitler came to power in Germany
yeah I'll be glad to give you a
thumbnail overview of it but let me
start by telling you I think it is
immediately applicable to the United
States
um and the way I tell you the story I
think you'll see how that works if not
I'll make it explicit
we can do both yes the German Think of
it this way in the 19th
century the
dominant player in the global economy
was Britain it is the century of the
British Empire of of whom it was said
the sun never sets on the British Empire
because wherever the sun is going down
there's Britain and wherever it's coming
up there's another part of Britain right
india was the great gem but British
Empire included parts of Latin America
large parts of Africa large parts of
Asia and so forth um not to speak of
Australia New Zealand South Africa and
all the rest of
it but there were
two upandcoming
challengers to the British Empire across
the 19th century
one was the United States the ex colony
of
Britain and the other was
Germany these two
countries were
capitalists understood that Britain was
the the what to beat if you're going to
make it
i don't think either of them aspired to
replace the British Empire but the
thought crossed their mind and it was a
delicious
thought uh you have United States the
Monroe Doctrine we're going to take over
LA we Latin America is
ours wow
you know colonial
dreams you know like taking Greenland
say or Panama or making Canada the 51st
state that sort of
thing and Germany had a notion of it
really being a a challenger to Britain
the German word
reich that's reich in German is empire
in English
roughly Hitler was going to create the
third reich that's what he called his
project they had had two earlier rice
you know the
empire the br the Germans had for
example large chunks of Africa that they
had colonized in the south in the east
in the west they had had a piece of of
China they had colonies in in Asia and
so forth so they were trying to to
develop in Germany they were mostly
successful as they were in the United
States they not only grew dramatically
but Germany wasn't really a country
until the second half of the 19th
century before that it was broken up
into little
principalities so the United States had
a bit of an edge because it was one
country from Atlantic to Pacific pretty
much by the n middle of the 19th century
the big thing that hampered the United
States was a civil war
the big thing that hampered the Germans
was the unification which is lots of
little wars with France with Denmark and
the different pulling together under a
charismatic leader Bismar by name in
Germany but with the end of the civil
war the 1860s and by around roughly that
time a little later in in Europe you had
these two powers had come together and
were independent had solved their divi
divisions north south with the United
States the defeat of the south and in
the case of Germany the defeat of those
who opposed German
unification chief of which were the
French and they were defeated in 1870
they were defeated and I believe you and
I have discussed it the defeat by the
Germans of the French opened a moment
for the left to have an opportunity
that's the Paris Commune of 1871
okay in Germany the experience here
was
spectacular instead of feeling to be way
below the British the British were rich
first the British had the biggest empire
the British were the center of power you
know the world used the pound sterling
as its currency all of that germany
always had an inferiority
complex so they went to work to develop
quickly so from 1860 to the end of the
century
1900 German economic development is
spectacular outgrowing the British
Empire uh despite the empire being still
intact but they were really ch as the
United States had its boost of
development after 1860 Billy the
railroads and everything else in the
west a whole middle class develops in
Germany around the success of their
capitalism a working class for sure but
a real
bourgeoisi in the way of remember
Germany is feudal much longer than
Britain or France is feudalism stays
strong in Eastern Europe relative to
Western as it dies
long story short and here's the point by
1914
Germany is a real
successful
powerhouse an exploding economic success
people middle class people living
extraordinarily
uh prosperous
lives if you ever want to understand it
the novels of Tomas
man Mannn Woodenbrooks and others
capture that better than any sociology
can and the working class which was the
first working class to develop a real
socialist movement on a mass scale not
so surprising Marx was German so they
picked up on him uh very successful
powerful enough that Bismar made deals
with the social had to so you had a an
organized confident working class who
attributed their success not so much to
the success of capitalism but to the
success of the socialist
party in getting a piece of that
activity for the working class
very confident very proud and quite rich
saving money very for the Germans very
frugal very frugal so they they
remembered the hard times before you you
know it was clearer for
them and so they think the world is
their oyster they are the they have an
empire it it's productive for them it
brings them wealth
and and then they have an
absolutely crushing experience all of
this is under an emperor in German the
word is Kaiser like Zar or something
kaiser Vilhelm was the one in power at
the
time and he leads them into World War I
they're going to win that battle like
they've been winning everything
else they
lose world War I
horrific the most
devastating destroying factories
railroads everything killing immense
numbers of people in trench warfare to
terribly destructive
but most important and cataclysmic for
them they
lose and now very quickly a one two
three
punch after the war the Versail treaty
which ends World War
I imposes reparations on
Germany the winners are going to make
the loser pay for the war
and so Germany is
required to devote huge portion of its
resources not to build up Germany after
the terrible
war but to pay back the French and the
British and the French and the British
insist on being paid why because to
fight World War I they had borrowed from
the United States
that's why the United States becomes the
world power right there it funded the
world war that crushed its enemies or
its potential
competitors and consequently the United
States becomes the power because no war
was fought here no World War I no
destruction no destruction relatively
smaller number of people involved world
War II wasn't fought here either except
for Pearl Harbor so you have it you have
it again but before we get to that here
now comes the thing so the Germans are
after World War I utterly impoverished
if you want to get an idea of a society
destroyed by this experience then the
thing you want to do is is look at the
lit the painting look at the literature
look at the
the well
Two names I'll give george Gross if
you're at all familiar with the
paintings of George Gross that's
painting Germany in the 20s after the
loss of World War
I the country is flooded with wounded
soldiers is this degenerate art
yeah and the
greatest theater producer probably in
the whole century Berto Bre writing in
Berlin in the aftermath of this horrible
horrible war
okay they can't recover because they're
funding the British and the French who
are using the money to repay the
Americans it's
destroying what's left of Germany the
shock of the war then the shock of
losing the war now the shock of being
unable to
recover where does it lead it culminates
in n the war is over in 1918 in
1923 five years later Germany
experiences the worst inflation in
modern human history in a matter of
eight months the currency goes from four
or five Deutsch mark that's the name of
their currency to a dollar to five
billion turn Deutsch mark that's crazy
my parents lived through that my mother
told me stories in which her parents she
lived in
Berlin her father would run home from
his job at
noon grab a sandwich prepared by my
grandmother my mother's
mother because he would give her a
little bag full of banknotes of
money and then run back to his job she
would run to the market to spend the
money because if she waited till the
evening the money wouldn't be worth
anything anymore yeah and we think we've
got it bad now and it's bad now well now
here comes the
punchline the Germans were frugal for
the previous 50 years of their
spectacular growth and prosperity they
had saved up money
with the money saved by two generations
over 50 years they could now purchase a
quarter pound of
butter they were wiped
out they couldn't handle
it 5 years later in
1929 the stock market crashed and we
entered the Great Depression
that means you hammered the German
working class with a
war a loss of the war the worst
inflation ever and the worst depression
in capitalism's history all in a 12 or
13-year period it was too much and they
went crazy and the proof of it is they
turned to a
non-German nonblue blonde non tall
person from Austria and said "You will
save us Adolf Hitler." When does he take
power january of 1933
right after the he
collects the
catastrophe in the last two elections of
1932 before he takes office the country
split right down the middle half went to
the old German middleof the road
political parties and the other half
split between the socialist party and
the communist
party and the business community held a
meeting of which there are records which
I used in my
writing what are we going to do both
sides denounced capitalism on the
grounds it had brought war it had been
responsible for the reparations
yeah that's why Hitler had to call his
fascist
party socialist it's the national
socialist party he had to tap into anti-
capitalism otherwise he wouldn't have
got to first base
nazi n a
zi that's the first four letters of the
German word nazional which simply means
national it's the national socialist
party so it's Nazi party against the
socialists and communists and that those
were fights in the streets they were
fights at the ballot box the business
community realized the country is
dissolving into two wings we have to
make a choice
and they went with Hitler and they
turned to Hindenburg the president of
Germany at the time and told him you
have to invite Hitler to form a
government that's what they did that's
how it happened why is it similar you
have a Now here's the parallel for the
last 30 to 40 years in this country
there's been an income and wealth
redistribution anybody who studies that
leftwinger right-winger except for a few
in the right understand this you can
take a look at the genie coefficient you
can take a look at the you know all this
status from the IRS and all the rest we
have moved wealth from the bottom and
the middle in this country to the top
that's why even our candidates talk
about uh the middle class is dying the
middle class is gone yeah yeah that's
right the middle has fallen out number
one number two you subjected
them after uh uh uh this kind of a thing
to a
pandemic which really shook them up an
inflation which shook them up still
shakes them
up and a serious
diminution in your position in the world
you have over the last 30 to 40 years
you lost the war in Vietnam you lost the
war in Afghanistan you lost the war in
Iraq and you are losing the war in
Ukraine
uh too many things are happening and the
working
class is hit in too many ways it's upset
it's angry it doesn't see a way out
that's a description of the German
working class that's why it went with
Hitler enough not all of it by a long
shot but enough of it to give him the
chance to get rid of all of his enemies
and reshape Germany that ought to strike
a chord this morning's headline this
morning 28th March 2025
the headline when I opened my news was
that President Trump has appointed Vice
President
Vance to remove from the Smithsonian
Institute the
anti-american
improper
ideology what the hell is that what is
that you know what the first thing comes
to my mind in the 1950s here in America
we had something called the unamerican
activities committee in the House of
Representatives that
hounded people out of their jobs and
their positions because they held views
that a collection of congressmen many
from the south held to be unamerican now
we've come to regret that that's
McCarthyism and but that's what they did
by the way among the people who left the
United States because they wereounded by
this committee for their ideas were
Bertold
Bre Charlie Chaplan i could go on that's
one of the reasons we came I thought to
understand what an aberarent horrible
period this was we understood
nothing we're just doing it again will
the outcome be the same i don't know
maybe they'll win this time maybe we
won't have what happened in the 50s
we'll have what happened in Germany in
the 30s but the story in Germany of a
working class that was shocked the
American working class was told that
America was the king of the hill which
coming out of World War II we were and
that this was just it was the way it was
american exceptionalism the uniqueness
God loves us whatever the form in which
you celebrated it but nobody here was
prepared that it would come to an end
that for the first time in a century we
actually have an economic competitor
called China we never had that russia I
think I told you this before Russia was
never Soviet Union was not an economic
compar uh competitor it was way too poor
way too small the America even today the
American GDP is 28 29
trillion russian
GDP3 trillion i mean this is David and
Goliath but David minus the slingshot
you know what they have military they
have nuclear weapon i shouldn't say
minus the slingshot here's a slingshot
but it's still David with a slingshot uh
China's China's 18 or 19 trillion that's
a serious competitor the two together
now you're talking and they understand
it and so do the folks here but not the
American people they must be kept
innocent of all of this except when
they leak their materials to the
Atlantic magazine one particular
possible symptom I'd be curious to hear
about is Elon Musk and Doge and how you
see that fitting into the state of the
American empire there's
nothing
new
original
extraordinary about all of
that with one exception
the choice of a
person who is not
given a top government job to do
this to have this sort of friend I don't
know how to
describe what you would call him i know
it's called the department of government
efficiency but I don't believe there is
such a they made that up there is no
there was no existing and I don't even
think they've gone through some
bureaucratic you know there is a way to
add a person to the cabinet you could
have you know we haven't always had um
uh an EPA we haven't always had a whole
bunch of agencies over time if something
is needed you could do that you could
have developed a department of
government
efficiency long ago if you wanted that
but my understanding it doesn't exist
it's just a madeup
thing so that is unusual that a person
is who's a friend is given such an
important
position and then it's also
unusual that that
friend is the largest contributor of
money to a political operation I believe
in American history if I have understood
correctly it's somewhere around $300
million one way or another through one
channel or another that he contributed
to Mr trump's effort this last time oh
wow huge amounts of
money and it's also a person who
is
contributing i know right now that on
Tuesday is an election in
Wisconsin for they elect their Supreme
Court judges so there's an election for
a Supreme Court judge and if I
understand the political it's a it's a
50/50 split on the Supreme Court so that
this election will kind of tilt the
balance which way that court goes and
the left and right you know Wisconsin is
a state of of importance because it's
it's not either in one camp or the other
it's half
half he is
giving
money I believe
$100 to every voter who signs a
petition that he has and he has has
circulating
Now obviously the idea is if I can get
this person to sign the petition for
$100 I'm going to let them know I want
their
vote you can't literally give people
money for a vote believe that's a crime
and most states can't do that of course
that's a crime because we used to do
that in this country and then there was
an outrage and it stopped so he's
skirting that law to to do this a person
who gives money to buy voters whether it
was in the presidential election or in
Wisconsin or in who knows how many other
I haven't done the work and I'm not
aware of anybody who's asked the
question
uh to whom else has he given money we do
know that he went to Germany and spoke
there before their last election about
how the German people should vote for
the
um the right extreme right-wing party i
don't know if you're familiar with that
the party is called the
alternativ um it got about 20 something%
of the vote did very well in the last
election he visited Germany and said
this is the only party that can save
Germany an extraordinary
act in case your audience is not aware
there are four or five other parties in
Germany it's a multi-party society
all the other parties all five of them
have
vowed never to work with never to have a
coalition with that alternative because
they are thought of as the inheritors of
the Nazi
history m the leading advisor to the
president of the United States
officially goes and supports the extreme
you want to know why the Germans are
upset with the United States before you
get to the
uh tax tariff on BMWs and Mercedes which
is coming and and that's terrible for
the Germans their their exports of cars
United States very important for the
German economy so they you can bet they
are scrambling now really but even
before that this kind of interference in
their internal politics holy macro and I
don't know if he gave money i don't know
if it's known and I don't know how much
it might be but given what he's done
everywhere else I wouldn't be surprised
and since his his wealth is listed last
I saw at around $400
billion giving 10 20 or 100 or 200 or
$300 million is immaterial to him it's
it's like you're giving me a quarter for
my next political race thank you very
much but you know it's a quarter that's
unique that you that a big a huge money
donor becomes a kind of an
adjunct to the president without being
part of the administration the way
others are so for example he doesn't
have to go before the Senate to be
approved they get to have him there
it might have been brought out by Senate
research which they're supposed to do
what he has done in his life and that
might have made it much more difficult
for Mr trump to give him the power he
has you know he comes from South
Africa ooh that might be an issue what
did he do there given the horrors of
that society and its
history anyway all of that was avoided
by this maneuver okay that's interesting
that's
unusual other than that
everything is the same and let me go
through a couple with you
every employer that I've ever studied or
every employer that I've ever worked
for has on
occasion fired
people sometimes a few sometimes a
lot and one of the standard behaviors of
employers when they fire
you is not to tell you the truth and
there are many reasons for that it's not
about honesty in the normal sense of it
it's because give you an example if I
were to tell my employ if I were an
employer and I needed to fire people and
say the reason is my business is not
doing so well i can't sell as many
widgets and so I can't afford to hire
people if I can't sell what they help me
produce i fire them but if I tell them
look and they ask me at the moment I'm
saying don't come back Monday they say
to me
why is my work no good i could say that
but that's hurtful and that's not true
nothing to do with their work it's cuz I
can't sell the output nothing to do with
you i can't tell them that because
that's going to make everyone I didn't
fire frightened
they're and when they're frightened you
know what they're going to do look for
another
job and if a good one comes along
they're not wait for me to fire them if
they find a good job better to go where
I know I can get a job than to wait for
the axe to fall right so I I don't want
that i don't want anxiety among my
workers i don't want to lose them before
it's when I have to i want to be able to
fire you i don't want you to make that
decision cuz that's a burden on
me so all
employers either themselves if they're
have a brain or they hire a consultant
to give them the line
of to tell a worker who's
fired and you choose carefully what to
say so that other people
aren't provoked into leaving number one
number two if you're a public-f facing
enterprise in other words you deal with
the larger public then you got to worry
about how they hear the
news right i don't want to buy from a
loser so you got to be care you got to
be probably pay you to do a little extra
advertising to make yourself look good
so that Mi music drowns out the fin long
story short one of the things you say is
that you are only working to remove the
inefficiency that dogs your
business and that as soon as these
people are fired the
efficiency problem will be solved which
means if you didn't lose your job don't
worry whatever it is made us do it is
done you're the good you're the lucky
one you're saved the other ones are
now for this to
work there had there has to be no
counterveailing evidence but in Mr
musk's case partly because I don't think
they're very good at what they
do they didn't take care of that here
again is that element of flying by the
seat of your pants the element of chaos
the element of fast and loose let me
give you some
examples the efficiency story is only of
course about federal employees because
who's being fired are federal
employees now let's take a look at that
together right i'm an economist i'm
supposed to know these things
so I did a little research and here's
what I found there are about 2 and a
half million civilian employees of the
federal government another two and a
half million are the military but I'm
going to put them aside civilian
employees you know the people who staff
all the agencies the IRS the EPA the aid
all those that we've been reading about
two and a half million i then went back
to 1960s and I said "What was the the
number of federal employees in 1960s?"
Answer about two and a half
million whoa wait a minute then in the
1960s we had 2 and a2 million civilian
employees give or take and in 2025 we
had 2 and a2
million the population in the United
States has grown 150 million people
between the 60s and now i am surprised
to hear this yeah which means under the
normal way efficiency is used in
economics the same number of federal
employees that serviced 150 million
fewer people in the 1960s is now
servicing
them that's an incredible increase in
efficiency you
what do you do you can't justify this on
grounds of efficiency it's
ridiculous but it gets better i then
took the next step how many people work
for state governments all 50 of
them 5 million civilian
employees and now the third level of
government in the United States local
cities
towns 15 million
so if you want to bring efficiency to
government
work would you focus on the federal 2
and a.5 million or the state and local
20
million you focus on the federal because
he
can he can't do it to the state people
they're employed by the governor and the
state and ditto for the local
so he's only going after them because he
can not because it's
efficient it isn't efficient first of
all they are efficient and second of all
efficiency would require you to do
something about state and local
government about which they are doing
exactly
nothing not even
trying partly because they would get a
push back first of all from every
democratically governed city and state
which would mean the vast majority of
cities are governed by Democrats not by
Republican he can't and he would run
political that's all this is it's a
show i look and look at the imagery
this is the best part for
me because it's a level
of
incompetence that
I I gasp
at unless I'm missing something you know
I made mistakes
too on the
stage covered by a million
cameras is a
prancing Elon Musk gripping a
chainsaw i don't know if you caught that
picture all over the country he was on I
don't know what the occasion was but
he's up on a platform a speaker platform
in his signature t-shirt and baseball
cap holding a chainsaw and the point was
I'm taking a chainsaw to the waist in
the federal workforce
so Americans saw the richest man on
earth taking a
chainsaw to rip the jobs away from tens
of thousands of working people
i I would if a student portrayed such a
story in a class on public relations I'd
say "I'm not just going to give you an F
i'm throwing you out of the class." Cuz
that level of misunderstanding of what
this is about is beyond repair i mean
that that could occur to you and that
you would do it without nobody or
yourself introducing the question maybe
that's not the image you want that image
will haunt the Republicans if I were a
Democratic advisor which I have been in
my life I would say just take this the
billionaire is firing the workers but
what also to fire 10,000 at a time which
he's doing in the IRS he did that in aid
he did that not efficiency if you're
going to make efficiency means you have
to study the situation look really
carefully at what everybody is doing and
then figure out better ways of do
wholesale no efficiency expert would
tell you to do that that that's dumb
that that that that's that's cha
The mere chaos recovery will undo the
efficiency you get now let's suppose you
get 10% more efficiency you're going to
get 10% loss from the upset of all the
workers who are not and then even
crazier they undo it they didn't take
the they didn't take the legal steps to
enable them to do it so it turns out
they violated half a dozen laws so the
people who get fired go into court get a
lawyer uh and that's now running through
57 different courts and some of these
judges are siding with the workers which
is likely going to happen going to
that's going to hold it all up which
means you've alienated that worker
you've made that worker look for another
job meanwhile you may have to give that
worker his job back and his salary back
and possibly pay a pedal who does things
like that what this is for
show it's like having ICE pick up you
know a Turkish professor who teaches
oceanography at Dipsy Doodle University
and ship her out of here what do you
What What for well it scares people
it is dem it is demonstrable it
is dramatic it gets you on the
news otherwise we're back to where we
were before what is going on
here well you know when there's a
catastrophe at your
house and everybody's fleeing you don't
behave the normal way you do you say
things you throw things you grab hold of
things in a way you wouldn't normally do
and we understand why because you're a
bit of a panic here and you're desperate
to get out
that for me is another symptom of a
declining empire as important in its way
as losing the war in
Afghanistan or turning on your earthw
enemies you know there's a if you learn
how to
swim or if you're instructed in how to
be a swimming
lifeguard you're told that one of the
things you have to be careful about is
that a a a person drowning or or losing
control in the water if you go to help
them they will grab on to you and
actually pull you down with them not
intending you harm but they are
desperate because their lungs are
filling up with water so you've got to
approach them very carefully or else
it'll be two people drowning not just
the other
person that's that's the sense I want to
convey here that this we are seeing
people behave
canada is an ally has always been Mexico
basically also subordinate
allies why would you turn on them why
would you why would and why would you
insult call the president of their the
prime minister of their country governor
as if he were the head of a state say
such a thing why are you telling the
Greenland the people of
Denmark I'm gonna take I'm gonna take it
i want it i'm gonna take
it what would you do what what is that
that's the behavior of a brownie a
drowning person who grabs hold of your
tree uh swimming trunks because it's
well because just trying to save him
they don't mean you don't mean to pull
off your pants it's just the way it
works that's a little bit of what I'm
think and I can tell you that more and
more of the world is looking at the
United States
now and I've not seen this before in my
lifetime you you know born in Ohio lived
in worked here all my life
uh the United States is a rogue country
the United States is the country to
which the rest of the world looks what
the hell is going on there you know how
the United States tried to pay uh to
portray the head of North Korea you know
a country nobody knows anything about
right he's crazy he's a little fat man
and he's
bizarre that's how the world is looking
at Mr trump and the United
States in that moment Donald Trump says
"I'm going to take back the Panama Canal
i'm going to take Greenland away from
Denmark i'm going to take Canada away
from the
Canadian what do you
What here's a wonderful Hegelian irony
coming out of World War
II uh a thinker of that time who was
very important named George Kennan
uh I believe he's credited with the
phrase that American foreign policy has
now to be focused on and now came the
key word
containment and the containment had to
do with the Soviet Union you had to
contain this
communism becau because after World War
II now there was that cordon of
countries of Eastern Europe the Warsaw
Pact Poland in the north to Bulgaria in
the south a buffer zone of sorts before
you got to Russia
proper so it had spread from because
those were all communist things and so
we had to contain that's why there's the
ring of bases if you ever look at
American foreign military bases they're
literally a ring around Russia russia is
the largest country by geog geography in
the world and so you know it's quite a
ring you have to
put um we were going to contain Russia
and the policy was to line everybody
else into this containment nato was
conceived as a mechanism of containment
it was the way the United States would
link and mobilize Europe or at least
Western Europe to contain Russia the
irony is the project to
contain has become its
opposite it's we who are becoming
isolated we who are becoming
contained not by a ring of bases
although that may come at this point but
by a ring of alliances and coalitions
for which the United States is the enemy
recent votes in the United Nations if
you take a look it's more and more
isolated it's United States Israel and
the Tobago Islands you know that it's
more or less how it goes right uh we're
alone we're alone coalition of the
willing it's a joke there was no
coalition on paper yes so it was 200,000
American troops in Southeast Asia and 11
French paratroopers you know and 12
British it's silly but the silliness now
is becoming almost perverse the
Europeans feel they've been turned on
and they are the United States is alone
it's even turned on its
neighbors the heads of Mexico Shine Bomb
and the head of uh uh Canada the the
banker Carney or whatever his name is
they're making incredible statements the
world has changed our friendship is over
our relations to Okay yes it's just
words at this point but we've not seen
those words not in 75 years everything
you know words are not zero it's not
that they don't mean anything they're
very powerful institutions if you ever
study Freud and psychology you know the
words you use are very powerful shapers
of you as well as everybody around you
so I would argue United States is
becoming more and more
isolated and I think that the Elon Musk
phenomena makes it worry he this is an
easy person to
dislike an easy person to feel alien
from and you know look at what's
happening to his
automobiles and he too admits it you
know he's paying now a
spectacular price for what he's
doing there's a demonstration tomorrow
in in in the headquarters of Tesla here
in New York City and I expect there'll
be hundreds if not thousands of people
there against at the
Tesla against Mr musk as a
representation of what's going on and
certainly people are not buying his cars
his his dealerships announced that the
Chinese announced I don't know if you're
aware two days ago the Chinese announced
that the bestselling electric cars in
China are no longer Teslas
their own company
BYD which stands if I'm if I'm correctly
informed BYD is the name of the
corporation stands for build your dream
English they are the the world's biggest
producer now of u electric cars and
trucks and they're the biggest seller in
China they surpassed Tesla by a lot
first year that they did that Tesla is
not selling in Europe it's a catastrophe
for him in Europe he's associated with
Mr trump and that's the worst
advertising imaginable in the world
right now and you know that too is a
symptom the joke about the end of the
Roman Empire is there a the emperor Nero
on a balcony playing a violin which he
was good at he's not troubled by Rome it
was said is Bernie he's
fiddly not a bad
image mr trump is
fiddly rome is
burning you can't you know after a while
get too hot the strings will pop and
your violin won't sound so good it's a
serious you know I'm trying to have a
little humor in it but it is in fact a
very serious situation and there is
not there is not the admission there's
not the recognition i will tell you that
more and more people are asking me to
talk because they don't agree with me
but they kind of feel as though they
ought to hear it you're a symptom of the
decline of the American Empire
absolutely i'd have to lick myself list
myself among them it's not so much me
although maybe that's true too what I
was about to say
is interest in what I have to say is a
symptom it's not that I've been saying
things that are all that different from
what I said 10 years ago or 20 years
ago but now the number of people I mean
Wow I can't quite get over it doing a
lot of work in India right now because
of the
interest you know podcasters and radio
and
TV india's in a big country bigger than
China by the way it just changed a
little bit they just went ahead of them
population by a little but India is a
you know absolutely important country
then I'm I'm overwhelmed
by how well what I say is known there
how many different outlets are
approaching me it's flattering i don't
deny it for a minute
[Music]
um but I think there's a
sense of something very big shifting in
the world all over the at all levels of
society different stories to account for
it different ways of interpreting it
understood but it's still important that
it's happening in different ways but
it's all happening at the same time and
that somehow the relationship between
the United States and its leaders and
everything else in the world is a key
part of almost every story i'm taken by
this image of the drowning child pulling
down somebody's uh trunks and or shirt i
didn't mean to pick up the trunk trunks
makes it funnier though
but one of your thesis ideas is that
capitalism is dying and it's being
replaced by something else witness China
and I wonder then if you
see Elon Musk and by extension the
increased role of corporations or
private wealth in government as
symptomatic or emblematic or
representative of this dying
capitalism's last gasp at trying to
double
down do you see that at all
i I would put it a little bit
differently and let me use you you
notice I I use history a lot i studied
history it's it's what comes to my mind
for because of who I am
if you study the history of feudalism
the system dominant in the western world
before capitalism arrives right thousand
years 500 AD roughly collapse alone uh
renaissance
1500600 arrival of
capitalism
roughly then in those thousand years of
feudalism you see a
remarkable evolution feudalism starts as
a highly decentralized it's the opposite
of the Roman Empire the Roman Empire was
a concentrated empire with a
headquarters in Rome blah blah blah blah
blah feudalism is
dispersed not
hierarchical lots of little lords and
surfs who are their own little entities
you know modern countries like France
Germany Italy come much later they had
to be created they weren't there before
rome Empire falls apart it breaks into
many many little
pieces yet by the end of feudalism by
the 15th 16th century what you have are
something called absolute monarchies
the opposite of early
feudalism highly
concentrated state dominated feudal
societies they even had to take one of
the feudal lords who used to be many and
make them get like competition they be
they fought each other they absorbed
each other and eventually one becomes
the number one feudal lord who takes the
name king that's what kings are the
biggest bestest feudal
lord you know the absolute monarchies
they're the ones that created the
Versailles gardens if you ever visited
Paris you go to the tourist thing
outside of the city in Versailles
spectacular palaces gardens these were
very rich highly organized highly con
the they produced the great painters the
great chataus that you visit to this day
why am I telling you
this i'll quote Markx markx wrote "No
system
disappears before all the possible forms
of it have been tried and utilized." as
far as they could be then we get the
next system feudalism went through a a
decentralized through several steps to a
highly centralized it went from a purely
agricultural to a lots of cities in
medieval Europe it handled
urbanization it went from no trade
everything self-sufficient to lots of
trade right capitalism likewise it goes
from the small capitalist with a dozen
workers to the big modern corporation
from a national cor from a local
corporation to a national corporation to
a multinational corporation to a global
corporate why am I telling you
this here's another way capitalism
evolved
it started as a thoroughly private
enterprise
undertaking coming out of feudalism
there were a few of these people who set
up little businesses but they had no
relationship to the government that was
all feudalism that was the king that he
didn't care about them they were the
opposite if anything he went and taxed
them they didn't like it and so they
fought back and they got little
privileges of not being taxed of not
being regulated little walled towns
where they could be
free why am I telling you this because
over time as they grew they stopped
being angry about the state and
realized maybe we'd be better off trying
to control this state don't get rid of
it control it so it works for us not for
the feudals which is where the state
comes from and not for the working class
we don't want that but for us we want
the government for the
employer and so they needed to develop
the government to give it the capacity
to do that on the one hand for example
the capacity that if the workers revolt
remember workers are many employers are
few us census right now classifies 3% of
the American people as employers the
other
97% are
not okay that's a problem for employers
because they're a small minority they
need to control the government to make
sure the majority doesn't crush them so
now they need a strong government with
troops and police and army and and a
judicial system so the worker who wants
to rebel gets punished and stuck in a
jail or fined or then they need also
help because other capitalists in other
countries I them with jealousy so we
need a navy and we need slowly the
government has to be built up you don't
trust it you don't like it but you have
to do it
in that scenario what China is is not
what you
said china is a
recognition as we talked a little bit
before that
capitalism
needs to go through all the phases it
can to survive
it adjusted the
private quality of its
beginnings by allowing the state to take
a bigger and bigger
role it didn't do it in a straight line
the great crash of 1929 brought the
government in massively to save
capitalism but in the aftermath of World
War II they pushed the government back
out that's what we you and I have lived
our lives in a period when they pushed
the government out in a way Mr trump is
the end of that period when we push the
he bring the government back
in but here's the crucial thing for
China we've had the government minimal
early capitalism
we've had the government brought in
Canes the depression and then this thing
called
Scandinavian socialism which which
seemed to mean a regulatory government a
taxing government lots of social
services produced by the government but
basically private capitalism for the
bulk of the goods and services in the
society so that's another form then we
have the Soviet Union and the Soviet
Union called itself socialist like the
Scandinavians do but they meant
something very different they meant the
government takes over and runs the
enterprise and they said that was
socialism but I would argue as you've
heard me I think before that it isn't it
wasn't socialism i don't dispute you can
call it whatever you want but they never
changed the employer employee structure
of
enterprises small group of people the
owner the director the board of
directors whatever you want to call it
overseeing and ordering about a mass of
workers who are
employees they have very little power
they have all the power these people
fire those not the other way around
these people direct those not the other
way around
these people produce a surplus that they
get not the other way around in other
words there's a highly structured
arrangement for me that's capitalism and
that was there when there were
capitalists were small and had a few
workers and it's there with a major
corporation today it's there whether the
private people do it or whether the
government does it so for me we still
working out all the ways you can have
capitalism if you understand it as the
employer employee
relationship in
production then China is simply the
latest experiment in yet another form
it's not private capitalism where you
might take the example Britain and the
United States it's not the Soviet Union
no private capital more government does
everything the in between
Scandinavian with a little government
and mostly private and now the Chinese
50/50 with a super powerful state and
communist party on
top that's a wrinkle but that
wrinkle has been more productive in a
shorter amount of time than any of the
others just like the absolute monarchies
were the most
effective spectacular achievements of
feudalism so I'm not surprised i think
we the the reason China is ahead is it
figured out that form of
capitalism which could get it out of
poverty which was its number one goal
100 years of humiliation of China was it
because it was poor backward
technologically underdeveloped like like
the whole global south like all of
Africa like most of Asia like most of
Latin America the name of the game for
them was above all else not the struggle
of capitalism and socialism the leaders
worried about that for the mass of
people how to get out
of my poverty all that that meant and
begin to live life the Chinese Communist
Party understood that in part because of
their differences with the Soviet Union
stuff that we talked about and they
understood that's that's the way we're
going to try to do it with all the risks
all the possibilities of failure we're
going to do a hybrid of 50 we're gonna
let the private go under our control
meanwhile keep our control by having
half the economy right under our thumb
that's how we're going to do it and at
this moment the year
2025 there is no contest anymore they're
just they look at it this way europe had
500 years to get ready to compete with
the United States they failed all hot
technology in the world today comes from
the United States or China
europe nothing nothing look there's no
there's no comparable Apple or Microsoft
or BYD you know BYD the electric Chinese
they're on the roads of Europe because
they don't have a 100% tariff we do so
100% 100% mr trump put it up to 27 a.5%
and Mr biden raised it to 100% so if you
want to buy a BYD electric car best in
the world cheapest in the world $30,000
get a car but what will that's what
it'll cost they'll ship you a car from
China they ship all over the world i
mean all of that's taken care of they're
a very very big and powerful company by
the way there's an American who has a
big piece of it owns a big piece of BYD
his name is Warren Buffett
smart cany guy yeah not held back by
stupid leftover Cold War nonsense never
was anyway
BYD can't bring a car here because the
$30,000 car which I would buy tomorrow
if if I could I have to give a 100% tax
to Uncle Sam another 30 so for me the
car costs 60 grand not 30 and that's why
I don't buy any because I can buy a 40
or $50,000 electric car from GM or Ford
or Tesla or somebody else it's not as
good but I don't have there's no tariff
anyway the these situations mean that Mr
musk and the United States are more and
more looked
at as
a problem to contain a little bit like
Soviet communism looked to
Americans and the Chinese in my judgment
are on the
cusp as we are in the United States
although for completely different
reasons given our very different
situations we're on the cusp of
discovering what European feudalism
discovered that the highest
achievement capitalism in China as this
hybrid is also the last achievement now
the trans the the Louise in France who
built
Versailles were the same family of
Louisis who ended up on the
guillotine with their heads chopped off
i'm of course not suggesting anything
remotely like that could or would ever
happen here
pause for
effect but the point is now comes the
question what do we need to do to do
better than what the Chinese have done
what's the next
stage how will people define the
problems that the Chinese have and will
have even the Chinese in the very wise
about that they understand their system
has
problems different from what they used
to have thank God they're much better
off than they used to be but they have
all kinds of economic and other problems
here's my
prediction these problems will sooner or
later and I hope it's sooner be
addressed by daring to
relearn Marx's lesson
take a look at how you organize
production the notion that you have to
have a few people at the top who run the
show and a mass of people underneath who
do the work is your
problem you've got to get rid of that
it's a little bit like
understanding that for the centuries
that there was
slavery there were all kinds of people
who understood those slave systems had a
problem and there were all kinds of
people who understood let's solve the
problem this way give the slave a better
diet give the slave some more clothing
put the slave in a decent house stop
beating the slave don't sell the wife
against the husband blah blah blah and
then there were people who said "No no
no that's it ain't gonna solve your
problem that way you know your problem
is the master slave relationship that's
got to
go that's me i'm just doing that now
it's that relationship that has to go
it's done that was Marx's point poor
poor fellow back in the 19th century i
want to see 150 years ago
he tried to get that
across markx made mistakes markx is
known saint and none of that but he was
very smart and he set himself the
problem how do you do better than
capitalism and he spent a lifetime
trying to figure it out and he ended up
with this conclusion in my judgment and
I'm open to
interpretations very Hegelia
the problem of
capitalism is
itself it's not this or that don't It's
not get the workers a bigger
wage don't stop it's like getting the
slave a better diet stop of course we
are in favor of a better diet for the
slave we We're decent people but that's
not the that's not the problem the
problem is slavery and the problem is
capitalism the problem you have a tiny
group of people who make all the
decisions guess guess what they're going
to take the money and be the wealthy
people the top 10% aren't they
everywhere all the time and every few
years we'll have a war on the poverty
which we seem unable to overcome now why
might that be h look at the taboo in our
culture right up to this minute you can
look at almost anything but not that
economic system
we will criticize our education system
we will criticize our transportation
system we will criticize we even
criticize institutions like marriage uh
like heterosexuality well but criticize
the employer employee doesn't occur to
anyone well you know 20 years ago it
didn't occur to anyone to question
sexism or in many parts of the country
racism
there comes a time when in history it
becomes possible to say "Hey this is
outrageous we won't tolerate
this." That's going to come for
capitalism and my guess is it's a
crapshoot whether it comes in the dying
capitalism of the West or the rising
capitalism of the
East and I guess it's going to happen in
both of them and wherever it happens
first it'll be infectious on the other
because the idea will be the problems we
face
now are finally those which will allow
us to ask the question might the
solution to these problems be changing
the
organization of the
workplace from a hierarchical top
down to dare I say a democratic
arrangement
in which all the people at the
workplace get
together talk it out and then have a
vote one person one vote after we've
looked at all the technical and other
aspects after we've asked the opinions
of those who have the technical
information we need to make an informed
decision
i remind people all the key decisions in
major corporations are made by a board
of directors most of whom have no
technical expertise whatsoever they
bring in the specialists who explain to
them as is needed to make the decision
what the technical ramifications when I
explain how a democratic workplace is to
be there uh the sweeper can make a
decision like the the the heart surgeon
in a hospital sure he can those
decisions that are technically
complicated the heart surgeons have to
explain what is what they know and the
sweeper tells them about keeping the
hallways clean you tell what and then
when everybody's had a chance to explain
then you make a decision that's all any
board of directors ever did that's what
the workers democratically will do and
don't tell me it's not workable because
the same argument was used how can
uninformed voters make a decision we
need a
king we cut the king's head off and the
decisions are not arguably any worse and
in many ways
better so let's do that let's finally
bring democracy to the workplace it's
long
overdue that's the next stage that's
what the revolution is about whether
we'll see it this year next year who
knows but nobody should say of folks
like
us that we only have a criticism no we
we do have a criticism
nowadays it's less and less necessary to
justify having a criticism since
everybody is feeling the need that there
be some criticism because of what's
going on but we are often charged with
not having an alternative yes we do and
a good one and one that comes right out
of the problems
today i don't think we solve the poverty
problem without the kind of change I've
talked about and my proof look at it
we're surrounded by
poverty we have been working we've had
wars on poverty
repeatedly repeatedly every 20
years this problem doesn't go
away in volume one of capital Markx
writes that the capitalist system has to
be
understood as being as successful in
reproducing poverty as it is in
reproducing
wealth that's right and boy is that a
Hegelian moment given that you and I in
a couple of days are about to be
participating in this forum about China
and the United States I think it's worth
asking right now just about how you see
Mao ranking among the Marxists and what
his contributions were and legacy is
oh that's a hard one
um well he's certainly among
the important
people
more I don't mean to be unfair to him
but
more because of his role he
brings
sophisticated
Marxism to China i mean you don't have
to say anything else that makes you a
world historical figure of the greatest
i mean it's stupifyingly important what
what he
did
[Music]
um number one number two his
political
decision has shaped the world in a
way not like GR Grochi's this corpus of
work on analyzing culture you know Mao
didn't do anything like that u not that
I'm aware of but
Mao said to the mar said to the marxian
tradition of which he had become a
part
that your focus on the factory on
industry as the crucial place to
organize is a
mistake it took unbelievable
courage
i
said I'm now you know as if I were
Mau it is a
mistake not to
understand that the rural
agricultural peasant of the
world can be an equivalently
revolutionary force
in Western Europe where Marxism is born
the most reactionary part of the society
were the
rural
uneducated often illiterate religiously
uh dragged
down and so the chances to organize
revolution there were hopeless and
revolutionaries who were themselves
typically urban relatively educated
relatively they went to work on the
workers that were close to them that
they understood from which they
themselves came the urban industrial and
you had this split mao is absolutely
staggeringly important because he brings
the notion of Marxism and Marxist
revolutionary anti- capitalist
mentality to rural areas who hadn't have
didn't have any capital for them they
were just beginning to deal with
capitalism and they already had this
enormous push against it that which
makes the evolution of the of places
like India and China radically different
from the west where the split of
agriculture and industry I mean Mr
trump's base is rural is suburban is not
you know the big cities of this country
are where Mr trump has got a lot of
problems right that that's our culture
that's not the way it is in the east and
Mao is as as much responsible for that
as anybody probably more so so that
innovation opened up Marxism to become
revolutionary for what is the majority
of the working class of this world which
is rural was rural still is rural and
agricultural and so now you know you
India has four communist parties china
is ruled by a communist vietnam is ruled
that that was that Mao breaks all that
open and makes that
uh a force in the world and if I had
time I would make you the argument that
what that was what that achieved is the
foundation for the Chinese economic
development post World War II
and that means that Mao is responsible
in a major way for the ability of China
to be a superpower challenging the
United States right now if you deal with
Mao in this country they have no idea
who you're I mean the the lack of an
understanding of just a simple story I
just told you in this country is stupify
it's like I don't know how to make an
equivalent it's like if that fellow over
there who's working with us wanted to
light a cigarette but didn't have didn't
know how to do it and I said here here's
a lighter he would be stunned a look at
that a thing with the fire
whoa and you feel for him oh well my god
you you're out of touch we've had these
lighters over 50
years there no Mao is a bad person in
China end of conversation and I I'm
talking about educated people like those
at Harvard and Yale my Chinese teacher
who's in China told me that they all
really look up to him yeah for God's
sake yes doesn't mean you can't disagree
with this or that or this policy or his
capacity of swimming up the Yangy River
and all the other funny stuff about him
he had that he had that they all do uh
but if the man is too Jesus Christ what
what do you accomplish i would say this
to you that the the pamphlets he
wrote you know the history the long
march when they're driven out of the
south driven out of Shanghai
um the early days of the Chinese
Communist Party were in the
cities as was Marxism focused and Mao
was a young
you know middle level income family kid
and he's organizing in Shanghai in the
south of China and the urban with a
focus on the
industrial and the the government of
China at the time a nationalist
government under the heading of a man
who became famous later Chang Kaishek or
the leader
um hates the
communists he is the expression of the
emerging Chinese capitalist class the
entrepreneurs remember China in the
early 20th century is what we're talking
about this is
19 20 in around here 25
um is just coming out from being a
semicolon it was never a colony in the
sense that Britain owned China the way
Britain owned India that that never
happened but along the coast of China
the cities that were interesting ports
were snatched by European countries so
you you can think of it as China had
portions of
itself taken over hong Kong by the
British uh there were Portuguese there
were
Spanish French they were horrible and
the the Europeans got together and and
defeated the old Chinese government in
something called the Boxer Rebellion
right at the beginning of the 20th
century so China was as they now say
going through its hundred years of
humiliation that's how it's called in
China
um and here were some communists who
were upset about
it they probably I don't remember the
detail but certainly from a good number
of them they had become they had left
China to become students in Western
Europe they didn't come to United States
in those days if you were a young
aspiring middlecl classy kid in China in
the
20s you went to
Germany
France probably that's maybe England I
don't know i only know I know the ones
about
Germany
because one of them became a student in
Berlin and took my mother out on dates
oh
those who I know and and and asked her
to marry him which he did not do but she
thought about it she married my father
who was not that guy for which we are
all thankful yes i hope so
um years later my mother went to China
to
visit and let it be known to somebody
she she didn't even remember who cuz
well she had to get a visa and crap like
that that she knew Juan Pinan but was
his
name he had by that time become a very
high official in Ma's government when
her plane when the plane arrives a black
limousine a mile long comes out onto the
runway and as she come down the stairs
they move her to the side the rest of
the passengers go in she goes into the
limousine and there he is welcoming her
ch big that's why I know all this
um Chanka murders a whole bunch of them
sends the troops groups they're having a
meeting of their little very small
communist party at that time in Shang
i'm pretty sure it's Shanghai and
murders a lot of them but a bunch of
them
escape and they then go on a long
trek pursued by Chunk Kaishek's military
to escape and they go deep into the
interior and that is called the long
march if you read any history of China
there will be a chapter in the book on
the long march because it was in that
period took a long time i mean I don't
know maybe years i mean they they eunan
into the deep interior of China you know
it's like I don't know if Americans had
gone at some early point in the 19th
century to the wilderness of northern
Minnesota or something like that you
know just far
away and they settled among peasants in
this
province and they organized the peasants
against their own
landlords built a base and that saved
them from the army of Chunk Kaishek and
there they built an alternative system
society putting many of their feel their
principles into effect but also not
being stupid built an army
it's very famous in China it's called
the E i don't know the reason why but it
had the funny name eighth root ar as in
the number eighth root
army the people the red army the eighth
army
then the Japanese invade China
1931 then there's a war between China
and Japan and Chan Kaishek now has to
stop pursuing the communists because he
can't i mean they're they're too strong
now in this distant province fights the
war with the Japanese in alliance with
Mao who's now the leader in this Eunan
and as soon as the war is over the
Japanese are defeated they turn on each
other and they have the Chinese civil
war which goes from 45 to 49 mao wins
chang Kaishek loses leaves China for the
island of Taiwan with his people which
is why Taiwan is really weird yeah
that's out that's the root of that
that's all that's about and if you want
to know why the Chinese would be angry h
they won a civil
war they worked together to defeat the
Japanese which they did chunk Kaishek
the discredited defeated loser of the
Civil War goes to this little island
it's like Jefferson Davis had gone to I
don't know Staten Island and set up
shop the Chinese think that's their
territory which it
is and that it's their issue to work out
that the United States would decide that
this is you know that is
sheer cuckoo and you couldn't possibly
tell that story to the American people
because it would have the effect it's
having on you which is oh I didn't
realize this the things you learn when
you're an ignorant guy like me talking
to Rick it's not your fault etmology
world history it's not It's not your
fault thank you i love to hear that no
it isn't it isn't it isn't the educa
look I went to Harvard Stanford and Yale
the education I got was very
mediocre really me not terrible but not
very good it just I had to learn to
on my own i had to where where else
would I harvard Yale Stanford I guess no
what was it at Harvard and were other
young people to work with me on it but I
think I would have found them anywhere
you know at Caltech or at I don't know
Illinois what difference there's always
there's always a few teachers there's
always a bunch of students you find your
way to them you know by accident oh
you're interesting having a beer with
somebody turns out they are interesting
people and all that that's all that
happened to me but I mean I had the
pressure of my
politics i
[Music]
knew it's got to be better than
this this you know as you grow up and
you become an adult this this this is it
you know you can do better than this and
that
impulse made me learn this stuff i I
used to get angry i do remember sitting
in a in a lecture hall at Harvard i
remember it
particularly being so angry at the
 that was coming out of that
teacher's mouth that I would literally
you know I was a good student i'm a good
boy i sat through it all took my notes
um and then I ran to the library
afterwards to refute it because I didn't
know enough to do it but I knew where I
would have to go and I and I would sit
in the library sometimes for hours
scouring an article or book to find
out some way to express my anger and
upset at what this person had told me
including courses on Chinese and Indian
history which I took because I wanted to
learn about other societies
you know my parents were immigrants so
you know but they were Europeans so that
kind
of you know the world had fallen apart
on them so that's why they had to be
refugees you know it's a traumatic
experience to be a a
migrant again we are busy deporting them
so they have to be evil empty vessels
that nobody understand but to be a
migrant is is a trauma my mother was
traumatized my father was traumatized
they left their country left their
language left their community left their
family you know entered the United
States they didn't speak English i mean
what a
mess all the normal turmoils and
troubles of life are multiplied by the
additional strains and pressure they're
very hard and they worked very My father
worked himself literally to death died
relatively early of a heart attack
because he worked he worked too hard had
a wife two children my sister and me
hard to earn a living he was a a lawyer
and a judge in Germany my father when I
was born he was pushing a wheelbarrow in
Youngsttown Ohio in a steel factory so
he had he People have to understand that
that family that comes from Honduras
they were I don't know raising bananas
on a farm now they're working in
Pittsburgh in in a meat factory you try
to understand what the these folks are
going
No so you anyway you grow up
with you also grew up with a concept
you're making me
think with a concept of difference it's
very hard for Americans
i spoke German at home mostly and some
French only when I was 5 years old they
dropped me in the
kindergarten i learn English you know I
was born in Ohio but I hadn't speak
English cuz you know I'm a baby i'm at
home speak my mother and father language
my mother was
German she was the most important adult
for me to deal with so I spoke you know
I still speak German absolutely fluently
because it I did it the first five year
my French with my father is I can do it
i can understand everything and I can
make myself understood but it's not
fluent it's
labored
um but here's what you get everything
can be different
the English language is one thing and
the French and German are each of them
separate from the other and separate
from English um you
understand everything could be different
it's hard to explain because you
literally if you're 11 years old running
around the playground with your friends
talking English except when you have to
pee or you're thirsty you run into your
house and chitchat with your mother in
German and then you go back out
that trains you into the multiplicity of
meanings of
inonations of
speech and you appreciate difference
you're not frightened by it you're not
amazed by it you assume it and therefore
whenever anything happens you naturally
do what Hegel teaches you the opposite
it's right in there it's right there
it's It's not distant it's not foreign
it's not a right thing it's right there
it's right there anyway I think since
China is seems to be the clear rival to
the American hegemony we'll be
discussing it is worth revisiting this
idea you mentioned but didn't follow up
on which is that Mao is in many ways
responsible for the economic powerhouse
that China has become and what I was
going to say is that as
a verified non-expert in Chinese
economics my understanding is that China
today represents this strange blend of
capitalist but also people and
stateowned state
intervening e economics so I'm wondering
how that comes out of Mao if I'm roughly
correct in my assessment well it's a
very long discussion so I'm going to
give you a very short answer please all
right
mao's only
friend in the long that long
march when he's making that long
march at that point the revolution has
already happened in Russia
1917 Lennon has died in
1923 so what's going on in Russia in the
second half of the 20s is a struggle
between the two most important leaders
of the communist movement in Russia
after Lenin because they're they're
inheriting the situation one is named
Stalin and the other one is named
Trosky and depending on how you come
down on these things one is a hero the
other one is evil or vice versa
that's how that goes
the global communist
movement splits on this subject one side
becomes the Troskyist movement the other
Stalinist movement stalin wins Trosky
loses first he's kicked out of the
government Trosky then he's kicked out
of the Communist Party then he's kicked
out of Russia he actually comes here to
New York spends a little time in the
Lower East
Side moves to Mexico and in Stalin and
in while he's in Mexico he becomes very
important to the Mexican communist
movement which was very strong then
especially among artists and they hosted
him those artists included Freda Ko you
know who she is see again Americans know
all about Freda Ko but that she was the
hostess of Trosky and probably slept
with him more than a few times is a
carefully cleansed to avoid any notion
that you know it's just the there are
three great muralists one of the
greatest Mexico produced muralist
painters people you know paint the wall
a muralist Diego Rivera the husband of
Freda Ko
Um David
Sikeros and uh Ortega
um yeah if you go to the New School
University just a few blocks from here
there are murals up in the top of the
building painted by
Ortega
uh all over the northeast here are
painted by Diego Rivera the Mexican
rockefeller was one of his patrons these
are all communists shikira Sautega Diego
Kala all communists all Trosky friends
of
that Stalin sent someone who killed him
with an ice pick in his ice pick i do
remember that very famous um so he's
gone stalin takes over
Russia but Stalin and Russia help Mao
he's a communist he's in China it's a
long shot you know it's a few of them
hunted by the government army but they
got support so they were very loyal to
the Soviet communists who kept helping
them and helped them all through the
civil war and one of the reasons Ma won
the civil war is he had some support
from Russia from communist Russia at
that
time i mean I don't want to take away i
mean it was Ma's victory he organized
that army the Chinese there was a big
army of Chinese people they fought and
they
won so in the early years from 1949 to
the end of the 50s first 10
years China is a very loyal
ally of the Soviet Union and these are
the
years of the of the cold war so the
United States allies already earlier
with Chongqaek tries to smash them so
the Mao and his people are very clear
the United States our friend they tried
to kill us you know for Chunk Kaishek
now Chong Kaishek is sitting in Taiwan
you know twiddling his thumbs and now
and now the Soviet Union is our ally but
we that makes us the enemy of the United
States and all of that if you ever go
back and you look at American history at
that time there was a
tremendous
halaloo about who lost
China and McCarthy remember the McCarthy
of the Senate McCarthy they went after a
high ranking state department official
named Harry Dexter White one of the
highest official would have become
Secretary of State at one point he was
in line like that uh but they hounded
him out because they they found him to
have been as a young man he went to a
Communist Party event or something they
had him and so he's he sold out the
United States and that's why we lost
China the idea that the Chinese had
something to do with this Americans
can't have it that it's all it's all
it's all about us anyway
uh so Harry Dexter White was blown out
of the water and the Chinese became
officially
bad
however by that time the
revolution being grounded in
agriculture had undertaken a number of
experiments unlike anything the Soviets
had
done mao felt it was necessary one of
them toward the end of the
1950s was the commune movement in
China and under Mao's
inspiration they formed comm I mean the
word
communism suggests something that you
would set up communes in which people's
relationship with one another is
communal not hierarchical the
goal
uh that's a long story of how they
worked for several years my master's
thesis at Stanford is an analysis of the
commune movement in China that's what I
did um because I wanted to learn about
it this what gave my gave me the
opportunity to learn um you know I I
wrote a master's not a master's senior
thesis at Harvard if you got very good
grades you could sign up for either
Magna Cumla or Sumakum Laad and if you
signed up for either or both of them
uh you were relieved of taking courses
in the last semester of your senior year
and instead you would write a paper a
major and I did that and there I studied
the rise of Hitler that was my you know
my that's my family the I wanted to
understand how did the how did it come
down on my mother and father to shake up
their
lives by the time I was at Stanford
which was just a year later I was on to
studying
China
and long story
short
what Ma's experiments did was to freak
the Russians out
and there began a
tremendous the the German
word which comes from
Freud splitting took place for some
years china and Russia denounced each
other they even had military skirmishes
on the Chinese Russian border shooting
at each other
it then died down but it was a split
that meant that the global communist
movement also
split there were those who went with the
Soviet Union and there were those who
split off and became known as
Mauists that didn't exist before
in the great revolutionary upsurges of
1968 in France when Charles de Gaulle
was driven out of I don't know if you
know the students arro rose in in
France reached out and said to the
working class join us in a revolution in
those days the French communist party
picked up 20% of the vote in every
election very very powerful and the
students went to the communist workers
and the Trosky workers who were also and
are still in in France
important and there was an
alliance and between the workers and the
students the chief of police of Paris
went on the television and said to the
government if you come down on the
students and
workers I can't be on your side and
neither will the
police got in an airplane left
France went to an American air base in
Germany to
wait i mean that's how close it came
though the leaders of that were not the
conventional communist party which was
afraid of doing that but the Mauists
went the Mauists took and because they
did Mao came into the consciousness of
the French people
brought by this revolutionary thing well
who was impressed luis Aluser my
teacher Jean Paul Sartra never the same
after that fuko never the same after
that i could go on jacqu Lakon all of
them many of them were Mauist Young
students caught up in it and they then
read Mao and they thought it Charles
Betelheim i don't know if these names
mean anything to you leading
intellectuals all around the
country they then began to study Mao and
to study what he had done and they began
to go to China to offer advice to give
them the benefit of what the West had
taught Marxists to this was invaluable
this was a way for a third world country
to tap western technology and thought in
a way it could never happen any other
way but nobody understood that they
don't get it now
either but it it transformed not just
the consciousness of the west learning
about Mao but the Mauists
learning what the West had to teach them
about strategy long story short they
made a strategic decision which I don't
think could have been done without Mao
even though this was
done mao is dead or dying so it it comes
with his end and the strategic decision
is we're going to build a socialism
different from the one in the Soviet
Union that comes out of their split with
Russia and we're going to make it
different from what socialism has
meant in the
west what did it mean in the west well
to this day right there are socialist
parties in all the European countries
many of them have been in the government
the Portuguese government right now the
so the Spanish government is the
socialist party um up until 3 months ago
the government of Germany was the uh was
uh Schultz Socialist Party uh
Scandinavia used to be called
Scandinavian socialism when Bernie
Sanders explains what he means by
socialism he refers to Denmark you know
that kind of that's the socialism in
which the government is very active very
regulatory taxes a lot and provides a
shitload of public services but leaves
the private capitalist sector pretty
much in private
hands right that's a kind of social it's
called socialism you know even here in
America people kind of the post office
is socialist you know they understand
the government does something could be
socialist stupid but okay americans
don't understand this stuff very well
the other sample is the Soviet Union
which the government comes in and says
"We're not going to simply tax we're not
going to simply regulate we're going to
take over we're going to own and operate
the enterprise as a state entity okay
soviet Union did that with its entire
industrial apparatus and with a good
chunk of its agriculture too not all of
it but a good chunk state farms which
are different from collective farms
those are
private by the way what Americans don't
understand that Russia never abolished
private property ever it's always been
an important part of their economy
always and that the state was limited
but relative to anything in the west the
state is a very big player China didn't
do either one of those China is unique
because it's a hybrid China is 50%
state-owned and operated enterprises and
50 not exactly 50 but roughly
5050 private all under the control of a
powerful government which is in turn
under the control of the communist party
that's a unique structure russia didn't
have that russia never allowed half of
its industry to be private and the
Scandinavian socialist never allowed
their socialism to include an immense
governmental
sector in American mentality it's large
because relative to ours it's bigger but
it it was never very significant that's
why there have always been Swedish
millionaires billionaire and all of that
they've allowed all of that china now
allows it also to be the private sector
includes Jack Mah and other big
billionaire but it's a unique model not
the Soviet they broke from that mao
broke from Russia in the in the late 50s
early 60s on these fundamental quests
opening that space you know other
countries didn't do that north Korea
didn't do that cuba even didn't do it
vietnam didn't do it the Chinese did it
now I mean now Vietnam does it following
the Chinese model because the China is
so important and Russia has
disappeared anyway that answers your
question we've spoken a lot today about
China and the United States where does
the collapse of Europe fit into perhaps
the demise of the American Empire but
also this transition away from
capitalism
yeah i think for
me partly as someone whose ancestors are
largely European
um here's the way it appears to me
i grew up in an environment in which
history was
presented in the following lopsided
way it kind of starts with Greece and
Rome and then
evolves into the modern period
and I've been regailed with the Greek
Empire the Roman Empire Athenian
democracy Roman slavery the Middle Ages
the arrival of the big European states
the clashes that produced colonialism in
which Europe becomes the
dominant power on the whole globe and
carves up the whole globe among the
European nations that famous conference
in Berlin in 1884 when they literally
sat in front of a map of Africa and
carved up Germany would get this and
France would get that and Britain
that and then the
explosions that we call world wars one
and two which were mostly not all but
mostly European events europe is the
center europe is the dominant europe is
where I look to learn about literature
and science
and and
now Europe is becoming more and
more an
unimportant corner of the world
it is
becoming what it used to look at the
global south
as an unimportant little corner of the
world good for growing bananas or rubber
plants or something else now Europe is
itself becoming a small corner the
modern development of high technology
it's a non-European event it happens in
the United States it happens in China it
doesn't happen anymore in Europe the
major industries that are growth
industries are elsewhere the industries
of Europe are
dying are
disappearing are shrinking
there's a joke that England is on its
way back to being what it once was a
cold wet offshore island of the
continent of Europe you know haha but
there's wisdom and truth in all of
that the center of activity the locus of
growth it's all
elsewhere
europe is less and less
important the war in Ukraine which is a
war in Europe is being decided by the
United States which isn't in Europe and
Russia sitting down and talking russia
that has declared itself and its future
to be
Asian literally people are walking away
from Europe and pretty soon you're going
to see scientific people artistic people
leaving
Europe europe is going to become a
tourist destination and not a whole hell
of a lot more unless they're very
careful this
is staggering this is this is the
relative decline of western civilization
and the rise of I don't know what we're
going to call it eastern civilization or
global south
civilization enormous changes that
include the decline of this system which
was a product of Europe's dominance
capitalism cap begins in England that's
part of Europe it grows in Europe first
it grows those in Europe the most it
enables Europe to take over the whole
world and bring capitalism to the rest
of the world through its colonialism but
now the rest of the world has begun to
take that capitalism develop it in new
ways and now we are all at the cusp of
moving on capitalism will have done all
it could again Marx's comment capitalism
won't disappear until it has tried every
possible way every form of continuing
its life and we are seeing a range of
forms anglo-american private capitalism
Scandinavian socialism Soviet socialism
China socialism with a Chinese uh uh
quality or Chinese face i think we're at
at the end of that and I think that the
demise of Europe is itself a symptom a
sign an accompaniment if you like to the
decline of capitalism each of them feeds
on the other europe is committed to
older capitalism it was you know it had
the benefit of being there a long time
it had the benefit of its long history
but it also had the burden of its long
history it couldn't adjust fast enough
very old story the very capitalism it
brings into
being then blossoms even more elsewhere
than where it was born that happens and
it was better for the Europe for
European development of capitalism that
capitalism did better elsewhere than it
did in Europe it grew faster in the
United States it's then grown even
faster in China leaving the Europeans
behind marx's theory of uneven
development there it is and I think it's
people should dwell on it because there
is nothing so dramatic as the
decline of
Europe that you see now it
is the only thing more impressive to
many of us than the decline of Europe is
the denial of the decline of
Europe it is amazing
one
watches really minor politicians in the
world picture like Kier Starmer or
Emanuel
Mron
talking as if they were the head of
their of the
country France and England once were but
aren't anymore you look at Britain and
and you see the pump and circumstance of
the coronation of King
Charles there it is all the drama all
the pump all the
circumstance of an empire that isn't
there anymore
they just have the co the the the coach
and the horses and the
to-do the
simolo of what it once was not the real
and and Mr
mak emerging from the A palace
today one begins to
laugh because you're
watching what is either a
clown or someone mimicking a
clown or a clown so far gone he doesn't
know he's a
clown and that's very funny except for
the French who don't who are now toying
half of France wants to believe with him
and supports him because he's the symbol
and the other half like the rest of the
world says go away you are an
anacronistic leftover way out of place
and just like that the west's hegemony
is replaced by the east but now well no
no no no that's very important and the
topic of itself what comes next there
are two options there's a
choice the Chinese could become the next
empire and Lord knows there might be a
logic to it they once had empires in
China they have some practice they have
some history united States it's denuvo
here it's all from scratch from the
beginning but there's an alternative and
the Chinese say for them the future is
this alternative and it's a genuine
multinationalism why not
think that the world excuse me might be
better
off without an empire any empire that we
shouldn't replace the British with the
American with the fill in the blank that
maybe we should learn that precisely
because empires go up and then go down
and the going down is painful and
difficult and expensive and
risky maybe we avoid that maybe we take
this moment of the down of the American
Empire and join with the Chinese let's
try to set up a
genuinely
multinational operation let's try we
made the first effort with the League of
Nations we made this second effort with
the United
Nations they were good they were not
sufficient
maybe something can be done now when we
are self-conscious
enough to admit where we are the UN
wasn't created out of a sense of the
decline of the British that was not in
the air that was not spoken the British
didn't believe it they made the UN
before they lost India etc etc is it
pronounced hedgeimony or hedge hegemony
it varies it depends on who you talk
to the one that I end up using is
hegemony hegemany but God knows I'm no
expert that could be crazy usage well we
can keep this in the episode hegammon
which is some of my European colleagues
you know where the term comes from why
it's used no
the leader of the Italian Communist
Party Antonio Groshi really one of the
great intellects that the Communist
movement in Europe ever produced um and
if you're ever interested
somebody you ought to know about he
[Music]
um was a literary critic when he started
long story short got involved in the
greatest wave of strikes ever to hit
Italy against the Turin the Fiat
automobile company whose basic
production factories were in Turin in
the north of Italy and around 19 I don't
remember the year 1912 1920 somewhere in
there they had unbelievable strikes that
built that union transformed
Italy and the leader of it was this
young sort of artistic man who was
remarkable because he came from was
born in Sardinia the island off of the
coast where Corsica
is and he was
born with a deformity which u in French
is called bosu in English hunchback
hunchback
you know the bone doesn't go right and
so you're kind of twisted little man
little twisted
man and but he became a hero in this
strike and shortly there and he was a
member it's very complicated Italian
history he was a member of the socialist
party in Italy already then as were an
enorm half the young people over 10 over
18 years old joined the socialist
mussolini was in the same party
mussolini then quit and went to the
right antonio Groshi quit and went to
the left when all socialist parties
split after World War I that's when all
the the communist parties were created
in the split and he he split for the
left and became a member and joined and
became the leader of the Italian
Communist Party after World War
II well before World War II the the
party grew very fast in Italy really
fast and Mussolini who went to the right
saw him as the great alternative as the
middle of Italian politics
dissolved that's why it's relevant to us
now it's the same story for the same or
very similar reasons the middle
collapsed and the right went to
Mussolini the left went to Gamshi and
the Italian Communist Party early in the
20s Mussolini to handle the situation
arrested Grochi and put him in jail and
kept him there for the rest of his life
while he was in jail he they kept
notebooks on and he remained the leader
of the Communist Party in jail
the notebooks were
assembled and they are called the prison
notebooks of Antonio
Grochi it has been an inspiration for
people everybody on the left in the
world there's there's an international
Grochi society for example very active
headquarters in Rome um Columbia
University Press published the complete
works the complete uh um prison
notebooks of
Groshi
and he coined in order to analyze Italy
he coined the phrase hegemony and
because of its centrality to his
analysis of the Italian and broader
European situation it became a term that
got picked up and so that's where it
comes comes from i think I first
encountered the word in high school i
read a book by Noom Chsky with hegemany
in the title yes and I didn't understand
very much of that book but I learned the
word at least okay well if you ever want
to get to go to the proverbial horse's
mouth Groshi is where it comes from and
by the way he is one of the great of the
Marxian tradition i mean if you made a
list Marx angles I don't know Lenin Rosa
Luxembourg Luc and a few he's right up
there what makes Groshi one of the
greatest Marxists
the best way to understand it is Markx
himself he dies in
1883 he devotes him he's a philosopher
you know he he
was he got his Ph the equivalent in
Germany of a PhD in philosophy he wrote
his doctoral dissertation on Greek
philosophy of you know 5,000 years ago
um and it's as a philosopher he gets his
first job teaching in a
university and he gets caught up you
know the way that students today might
get caught up in a pro Palestine kind of
rally or something on the campus
um he got caught up in struggles of
workers in the cities and towns where he
was a
professor long story short he shifted to
economics and then he writes the rest of
his life basically about economics and
politics with a deep philosophic
background you know he is he is one of
the great students of Hegel he comes out
of the Hegelian tradition he referred to
Hegel all his life as my mentor and
master um he had he had criticisms of
his teacher as rightly he should but he
was very angry when people denounced
Hegel he would immediately run are you
kidding you don't understand Hegel you
don't get anything I'm doing either a
message to the left lenin later who
didn't understand it late in Lenin's
life he said that's he makes a famous
famous quote anyone who doesn't know
read and study Hegel cannot understand
marks Lenin said that because it's it's
how he came to it very famous Lenin has
a whole book very few people know it
called the conspectus on Hegel in which
he writes an immense volume of endless
notes on Hegel and how important Hegel
was to Lenin's conception of revolution
of society of social change and all of
that now Hegel is a dead dog in this
country the only places that teach Hegel
in any systematic way are Catholic
universities because they kept up the
conventional when I was I wanted to be a
philosopher i mean when I went to
Harvard I majored in phil I wanted to
major in philosophy but between the
horrible way it was taught and my father
who said I'll never get a job as a
philosopher I didn't I went to economics
following Markx not that I didn't do it
for that reason but like that anyway
Markx writes it's all dus capal how does
how does capitalism work it's an
economicsy
focused so much of the Marxist tradition
that rises up very fast toward the end
of Marx's life and really takes off
after he dies the last decades of the
19th century and then the 20th century
which is the spread of Marxism to become
global which it hadn't been before
[Music]
um what also happened was that as it
became bigger and bigger it
attracted people whose primary interest
wasn't economics who you know think of
it this way they said thank you Marks
you've helped me understand capital now
I see how capitalism has up the
movies or opera or literature
or how it has shaped our culture gamchi
is crucial because he's the first one to
systematically do that and what I mean
systematically he's sitting in jail if
my memory is right he's arrested in
1922 and he
dies in 1939 the last few months they
let him out of jail they have made him
so sick in jail that he dies of but
mostly he killed him in in so many so
many words but he's sitting there for
many years right so he can do you know
written analytical work by force of
prison and so it's an enorm and he
studies he reaches the conclusion let me
put it to you this way if you're
interested in this in the marxian
tradition
uh I teach a I used to teach a course at
UMass called the history of the marxian
tradition there was such a demand you
couldn't hold the students back from all
the fields and all I would do is say
after marks let me show you what
happened so
Grshchi's genius was to
say I'm je and you almost use these
words I'm jealous of Lenin
he admired
Lenon i'm jealous of
Lennon he made a re He could make a
revolution out of the chaos of Russia we
have very similar chaos here in Italy
and we couldn't do
it why not what the objective situation
very similar to Russia devastation of
war weak capitalism wild suffering you
know and a a core of revolution we have
that in Italy when Italy did um why
couldn't it work why why did the
revolution not happen in Italy the way
it did in Russia you know there were
revolutionary upsurges all over Europe
after World War I you know in Bavaria
they formed something called the
Bavarian Soviet Socialist Republic they
even took the name and for a good long
while Munich the big city in the south
of Germany was the head of the
revolutionary government in Budapest in
Hungary you know two hours away the same
thing gayorg Lukatch the great thinker
was the minister of education in the
revolutionary Soviet Socialist Republic
of Hungary you had it in uh in Europe
you had it in Seattle there was a
revolutionary movement in in Washington
you know all over the world this
happened anyway in Italy he asked
himself the question and he reached the
following
conclusion it's the culture of Italy
it's the culture and the way he put it
using Marxian type language the
objective conditions for the revolution
were present the subjective conditions
were not
what was in people's heads how they
understood the situation was different
here than in Russia and what I'm going
to show you he said is how that worked
and in order for him to do that he had
to
understand the music the
religion the family customs and he then
devotes himself to studying that and
he's a real scholar stuck in jail he had
been a a theater critic publishing you
know theater reviews before he got
politically involved and so it becomes
the first of the great Marxists to shift
over and begin to take that theoretical
framework but apply it not to economics
not even to political things he talked
about politics a lot but that was not
the notebooks are about culture and
there for example you have one of the
greatest analysis of the Roman Catholic
Church ever because it's it's the church
he grew up in it's the church of Italy
it's the it's the Vatican i mean
everything's there so he and it's very
powerful among the people of Italy it's
been there for a thousand years or more
and he wants to understand how that
ended up being something that blocked a
revolution otherwise about to happen
from happening and he does the same for
Italian music he does it for Italian
painting he does it for Italian family
life and so every Marxist
since and many others have taken their
clues from this
extraordinary cultural analysis how to
think about these things it's not so
much the particular point he makes but
how he analyzes novels how he analyzes
newspapers in Italy it's just
extraordinary and here in the United
States it took off in the following way
because it's
America the peculiar way this country
works i'll tell you to this
way 20 times in my life I have been
present at some you know I've been a
professor all my life or at some seminar
you know like at Stanford or a place
like that uh you know I went to school I
think I told you I spent a year at
Stanford as a student uh and there'd be
somebody giving a paper on Grochi or
comparing Grochi to somebody else and
they would go on and go go on and I you
know given I'm politically active i
noticed this was Grochi they footnoted
Grochi they talked about Grochi but they
left something
out he's a communist he's the head of
the Italian Communist
Part They had to clean him out they had
to take off his feathers they They could
It's America they could not
handle that that's what he was that he
was an important figure in the
literature department at their seminar
on
postmodernism and there's Mr grochy as
he often was but he was cleaned up he
was just Mr groshi an important Italian
intellect not you know it's absolutely
incredible i told you one of the people
that I had time with is a is
is the Groshi of France which is Altus
right right
altus is a member of the Communist Party
an activist in the Communist Party all
of his adult life
[Music]
um and he became the recctor of
something in Paris called the Echol
normal that's the highest level of
university you can get to it's like I
don't know Harvard or Yale or some like
you know Oxford or Cambridge so not only
is he a professor there but he's the
recctor the recctor is the highest
deficit it's like we don't have that
here but I don't know provost or
chancellor or some hoidytoidy president
of the university is an active communist
public active comm you know and this is
in the 1970s and 80s can you imagine
here in United States you know I would
so I would talk about alt tus you know
people who know a little bit they know
who that is he's widely published and he
is the recctor at no means you're
France's number one philosopher
that officially that's what you are but
here in America they knew who he was but
that he was a communist no no when I
would tell them that they would look at
me they would look at me as if somebody
they really admired turned out to have a
flatulence problem you know they they
didn't know what to do with the very
strange it's very strange about our
culture in Europe everybody knows you
know to be a communist or a socialist in
Europe is no big deal every country has
communist party socialist party
everybody's family has Uncle Harry or
Aunt Louise who's in the party and so
when they have a family picnic they have
arguments and everybody everybody
nobody's frightened by this but not here
here because it's you've repressed it
you can then tell stories about it and
they can become monsters because who's
to refute it nobody so you Anyway that's
where hegemony comes from and and Groshi
is the key man
each time we sit down for a conversation
now I'm thinking we're finally going to
run out of stuff to talk about but then
we don't even get to my notes at all so
that leaves room for at least another
one so Rick tell me how often you come
here seriously I've been coming every
couple months two or three months so and
you do it you fly in and do a bunch of
interviews and I flew in on a red eyee
last night so I got in at 5:00 a.m this
morning oh had an interview at 8 for 3
hours this one's for 3 hours did you
sleep on an airplane no and then I've
got one for three hours after this
with Chris
okay yeah so it was great Rick until
next time
[Music]
